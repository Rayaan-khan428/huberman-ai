recent results molecule found certain caffeinated beverages
proven useful weight loss, mental performance,
controlling blood sugar levels. GLP-1 glucagon-like peptide 1. Glucagon-
like peptide 1 found brain body. acts brain body.
many different things. one primary effects discovered reduce
hunger. two ways. activating certain neurons
hypothalamus. brain region controls hunger satiety. makes us feel
full level brain, makes us feel sated, is. actually makes us
feel full. turns GLP-1 acts certain receptors gut make us feel
ingested enough food. doesn't necessarily make us feel gut
distended, makes us feel full. really interesting because, think it,
eat, stomach fills up, obviously. information
communicated brain brain can send satiety signals actually
shut off hunger. believe not, brain actually activates signals reduce
desire chew stomach full. GLP-1, mentioned, works
brain create feelings satiety enough reduce desire
eat more. GLP-1 acts directly gut give us slight sense fullness
gut, communicated brain. really, two parallel signals
sent GLP-1 present system. Now little bit relevant history
GLP-1. actually discovered Gila monsters. reptiles can
go long periods time without eating. clever scientist decided study
certain animals like Gila monsters can go long period time without ingesting
anything. produce large amounts GLP-1. isolate
peptide GLP-1, looked analogous peptide humans. turns
exist. mentioned, released brain body make
feel full sated. telling this? Well, today going talk
caffeine. one particular caffeine source, yerba maté,
forms teas similar yerba mate stimulate release GLP-1
significantly. also nowadays drugs called analogues GLP-1.
drugs mimic identical kind GLP-1 make.
drugs proven effective treatment certain forms
diabetes treatment obesity, trigger enormous amounts GLP-1
pathway activation. extreme cases people really struggling


weight loss. clinical trials data general
population now very, promising GLP-1 analogues. Yerba maté tea, provided
not smoked variety-- mention number people cued
fact yerba maté teas come smoked varieties nonsmoked varieties.
smoked varieties thought perhaps carcinogenic. is, procancer-
causing. advise people avoid smoked varieties yerba maté tea. yerba maté
teas known stimulate significant amounts GLP-1 release. can
effective weight loss tool, mainly blunting appetite. again,
level brain level gut. Now just told
known period time, new set findings just
published Cell Reports Medicine, Cell Press journal, excellent journal-- indicate
exactly GLP-1 stimulates satiety can trigger additional weight loss
mechanisms. find mechanism really interesting
actually really important, given topics covered podcast before.
basic finding GLP-1, whether not stimulated release
analogue drug one prescribed drinking yerba maté tea, instance,
stimulate release so-called endogenous GLP-1, yes, makes feel
full level brain body. turns also stimulates thermogenesis. Now
thermogenesis active utilization metabolic energy. fat cells,
particular-- so-called beige brown fat cells-- potent source thermogenic
activity body. basic background white adipose cells,
white fat cells. beige fat cells, brown fat cells. beige
brown ones fat cells actually want of. not abundant
skin. abundant really around clavicles upper neck.
ones generate heat. beige brownness actually
consequence lot mitochondria cells. GLP-1 elevated
system, turns communicates white fat cells helps convert
beige brown fat cells. is, takes fat cells not anything
useful except stored energy. think people like
fewer white adipose cells. actually
need thin, lean, people suffering
many white adipose cells. Well, ingest yerba maté tea
take GLP-1 analogue stimulate GLP-1 number different ways, yes,
stimulate increased satiety, also stimulating conversion white

also makes feel comfortable colder environments rest.
much mechanism induced to, say, take
cold shower regular ice baths get cold water regularly. That, too, stimulates
conversion white fat cells beige brown fat cells. like findings
much provide mechanistic coherence. provide really nice
story something like GLP-1 effective weight loss. Yes,
one hand, GLP-1 reducing appetite, that, course, will help people maintain
lose weight. also increasing basal metabolic rate. now know
accomplished. likely accomplished least one mechanism
stimulation conversion white fat cells, don't much us except

basic tool takeaway that, somebody interested losing
weight want leverage GLP-1 pathway, drinking cup two yerba
maté tea early day great way stimulate GLP-1 release.
ways stimulate GLP-1 release. can get certain forms exercise.
particular, fasted exercise. actually vote favor fasted exercise.
debate whether not fasted cardio burns fat nonfasted cardio.
data basically say no, doesn't really matter. doesn't really take account
longer arc things like GLP-1 release, needs taken consideration.
fasted cardio. drink yerba maté tea, keeping mind yerba
maté tea contain caffeine. talk specific forms stimulants
including caffeine maté has. maté great way stimulate GLP-1
release. then, course, interested robust
activation GLP-1, perhaps might want consider new
prescription GLP-1 analogues there. severe stimulus

livemomentous.com/huberman. talk caffeine. mentioned earlier,
caffeine consumed basically adults every single day consumed
regular times day. fact, take look caffeine intake


caffeine intake somebody close you, realize don't
well caffeine intake arrives even 10, 20, 30 minutes past expected
usual intake caffeine. pretty remarkable, brings mind ideas
all, quote unquote, "addicted caffeine" caffeine somehow bad. certainly
not going make argument caffeine bad. First all, regular caffeine
user. wouldn't call caffeine abuser, regular caffeine user.
caffeine known certain health benefits. listed off earlier,
mention now going forward. Caffeine known certain
neuroprotective effects. ability increase neuromodulators,
dopamine, also so-called catecholamines like norepinephrine.
don't know names mean, molecules increase levels
alertness, motivation, drive. therefore not surprisingly large scale
analyses relationship depression caffeine shows that, provided
people not drinking much caffeine, makes overly anxious, regular
intake caffeine inversely related levels depression. may
antidepressant effects. direct indirect. mean that?
Well, can imagine people ingesting caffeine motivated
work pursue quality social interactions, probability will
depression lower. also direct effects chemical
systems brain relate mood well-being offset depression.
not clear whether not effects caffeine countering depression direct
indirect. Nonetheless, relationship there, interesting positive
one. say negative correlation, positive effect overall mood well-being,
exact. Now also case caffeine can improve mental performance
physical performance. demonstrated tens thousands studies. will
review studies this, particular, today. just give sense
caffeine works level timing impact mental performance physical
performance, ingest caffeine, provided don't lot food
stomach blood sugar isn't particularly high, generally, experience
increase alertness within five minutes. increase focus alertness
peaks around 30 minutes ingestion caffeine persists long 60
minutes. Now assuming one takes caffeine pill form drinks entire
caffeine drink within short period time. little bit later, talk can
consume caffeine regular intervals mental work physical work way


can increase mental performance physical performance. just
touch caffeine intake really mental performance physical
performance. Perhaps robust finding across studies
examined caffeine reduces reaction time. is, improves reaction
time. doesn't make longer. makes shorter. instance, laboratory study
people asked hit lever every time hear tone, can greatly
reduce time tone pressing lever people ingest caffeine
30 minutes task. Now seems like trivial task,
also seen domain sports performance even cognitive performance,
people arrive particular answer question. answer
question pulled memory banks within brain, hippocampus,
instance, brain structure involved memory. asking people,
instance, remember capitals different states cities remember certain
historical facts, will particular rate. ingested caffeine within
hour prior, ability recall information much, much better.
faster, not appear accuracy reduced. fact, many cases, accuracy
enhanced. caffeine works reaction time systems
brain body. talk mechanisms little bit. also stimulates
certain neurotransmitters so-called neuromodulators within brain body
give neural circuits brain associated learning memory lower
threshold activation. mean? means better able
access brain circuitry involved learning memory certain
amount caffeine circulating system. makes caffeine incredible
performance-enhancing compound.

00:20:23 Caffeine Nature & Positive Reinforcement

give tens thousands examples humans.
that, want just touch know existence caffeine nature
existence caffeine nature effects animals tells us
caffeine humans. alluded earlier, caffeine
us not just making us alert, improving memory, improving reaction time,
on. actually acting powerful reinforcer experience. acting
not just powerful reinforcer caffeine-containing drink drink also


mug contained in, plus person might sitting across
consume caffeine, forth. little bit hard
conceptualize reinforcer calling reinforcer, let spell
three specific ways. often hear word reward, think, OK,
certain things like outcome, certain things rewarded. Right?
something, receive praise. praise reward. therefore,
likely thing future. fact, lot parenting like that.
lot life like that. However, hear word reward, often think
something feels good us. certainly, worked hard get
praise, natural praise feel good us. instance, work
hard get certain outcome-- trophy, financial outcome, degree outcome,
recognition, et cetera-- can act rewards, conscious
rewards. aware happening. Reinforcers little bit different
word reinforcement can apply conscious rewards sort just
described, also many ways caffeine stimulates release
chemicals body act reinforcers. reinforcers subconscious.

say, duh, think us don't realize reason caffeine
coffee coffee comes plant. coffee bean, certain teas, which,
course, plants people brew. Caffeine contained teas, yerba
maté. Well, bitter substance-- because, fact, caffeine quite bitter
high concentrations. bitter substance something insects
animals want consume all? turns that, plants, caffeine

reinforcer bees consuming different nectar. way works
bees, course, go flower flower, consuming nectar.
bringing nectar pollen back hive, provides critical nourishment
bee colony. bees foraging way includes information color,
particular, ultraviolet color, things can't see can see,

nectars contain small amounts caffeine preferred sources food
bees. study beautiful able confirm mask
caffeine taste. know bees not preferring taste caffeine.
pair caffeine different food sources bees,
remove caffeine. find bees strongly prefer flavors
contain caffeine, not taste caffeine rather way
caffeine-containing flavors made bees feel. caffeine-

really talking fact A, caffeine exists nature, plants. exists

course, can high levels caffeine plant. plant also contains

talking strong flavors plus strong neurostimulant effects caffeine.
important point effects caffeine subconscious. not

00:26:44 Caffeine Effects Brain; Reward Pathways



might even come like smell coffee forth.
caffeine stimulates release certain neurochemicals brain,
particular, dopamine acetylcholine, two neuromodulators increase focus
alertness feelings well-being. little bit later, tell caffeine
stimulates release dopamine way much distinct classical
dopamine pathway associated addiction reward. fact, can think
caffeine somewhat privileged access reward systems. give
bit hint going. Caffeine stimulates release dopamine
acetylcholine not within classic so-called mesolimbic reward pathway. just
fancy nerd speak reward pathways brain. associated things
like sex food drugs abuse, like cocaine methamphetamine. rather,
caffeine seems stimulate release dopamine parts brain

multiple dopamine systems brain body, caffeine seems
stimulate dopamine directly within components brain associated
clarity thought well-being, clarity thought. Now, also talking
caffeine strong reinforcer makes feel good overall. does.
suggests also taps classic reward pathway.
interesting frankly almost diabolical way. regularly ingest
caffeine, stimulates increase dopamine receptors multiple sites throughout
brain but, particular, within reward pathways brain. not areas
brain associated focus clarity thought cognition. that,
also increasing level dopamine receptors reward pathway.
means that, dopamine released response positive
experience, social experience, number things can stimulate
dopamine release, receptors, parking spots, will,
dopamine arrive exert increases mood, increases motivation,
overall feelings drive excitement. four ways caffeine works
need understand. First all, caffeine acts reinforcing agent. increases

00:29:55 Caffeine Reinforcing Agent

caffeine reinforcing agent. Again, first beautifully demonstrated
study honeybees bees prefer nectars contain caffeine.
makes perfect sense terms ecology bees flowers contain nectar.
advantage, least terms adaptation, flower benefits
distribution things flower, good flowers bees benefit,
getting food. kind symbiosis there.
humans, consuming caffeine-containing beverages sake. don't think
mind, bees mind, frankly, trying preserve
plants provide caffeine. think suffer, say 90% adults
suffer greatly caffeine-containing coffee tea plants gone,
certainly. us not consuming coffees teas caffeine-containing
foods thinking plants come want help
plants. thinking want help ourselves. yet point
reinforcing effects caffeine largely subconscious. not
aware them. Now might say, no, not true. drink caffeine, makes
feel really good. aware makes feel good. order illustrate
reinforcement really works, let give counter example,
aversive agent. reinforcing agents aversive agents. say
compounds nature exist plants aversive. indeed,
are. say compounds present low concentrations
couldn't taste them. say wake morning go
refrigerator open thirsty, reach nice rich red-
containing beverage glass jar. Maybe looks like cranberry juice something
sort. even nice clear glass water. looks like jug water glass
water, drink that. Taste fine you. Maybe even tastes great you.
say 30 minutes later, feel little queasy, feel little off, feel like


going back sleep, just don't feel good. don't know why, nervous
system predictive machine, process back integrates.
say integrates backwards immediate experience preceded not
good feeling. can reliably say much lower probability next
day wake reach beverage
container even. maybe novel environment, maybe staying
Airbnb hotel something sort, might even find don't really like
kitchen consume beverage first place. don't know
why. unless got very, sick day before, unlikely
strong response entirely avoid, instance, water glass jars
containing liquids, et cetera. say went back refrigerator
consume beverage just didn't feel well, felt less good
normally would. Well, even without ability taste beverage even
without understanding happening conscious level,
very, high probability will avoid drinking particular beverage
certainly location volume subsequent days. just
way aversive agents work. work way activating neurons gut
communicate areas brain give us feeling queasiness.
hearing this, pathway association times felt
queasy wanted vomit powerful might even feeling
symptomology now. certain people going increased salivation
precedes vomiting, know class neurons brain relate
area called area postrema actually stimulates vomiting. keep talking
this, probably feel like want vomit, going move
moment. ingest caffeine-containing beverages foods, exact
opposite scenario just described. Caffeine, reinforcer, makes us feel
slightly better lot better immediate minutes hours ingest it.
acting reinforcing agent not just effects caffeine
things preceded ingestion caffeine, return
caffeine-containing beverages, coffee tea maybe even foods
contain caffeine, even taste foods not something
otherwise consider, especially delicious. fact, people take first
sip coffee tea caffeine-containing beverage, find bitter.
not taste caffeine. taste beverage


independent caffeine. However, caffeine present there, come
prefer taste tastes. fact, will, mentioned earlier, will invest
lot financial resources time energy make sure get beverage.
trying make sure not get taste get
caffeine. positively reinforcing. taste therefore takes new
significance, new meaning, come associate positive. fact,
us, including myself, love taste espresso, love taste coffee, love taste
yerba maté even initial taste, first time consume beverage,
either neutral negative. reinforcing properties
caffeine. then, course, direct actions caffeine. is,
faster actions caffeine. just list off briefly
mind going forward, caffeine also increases release dopamine
acetylcholine, neuromodulators forebrain, increases clarity
thought ability rule switch, ability move one context another
change understand rules engagement, social engagement, physical
engagement, mental engagement, forth. mentioned before, caffeine also
increases number dopamine receptors reward pathway, good
thing happens you. positive experience will potent

briefly talk adenosine molecular features. again, don't
background biology, don't worry. promise make clear everyone.
First all, caffeine called methylxantine. plant alkaloid.
caffeine bitter. Again, give just tiniest little bit pure
caffeine, find extremely aversive. plants snuck
small enough amounts caffeine masked flavor caffeine
flavors bees humans want consume them, don't
know plants think, seem diabolical clever
seeking caffeine-containing plants, beverages, foods even though caffeine
alkaloid very, bitter. Methylxantine-- caffeine-- binds
adenosine receptors. really two types adenosine receptors.
so-called A1 receptors A2 receptors. present different
parts brain body different levels. don't get far receptor
subtypes. importantly understand adenosine makes us feel tired
way taps ATP pathway. ATP pathway central energy
production feelings overall energy brain body cells organ
systems. caffeine binds adenosine receptors, prevents adenosine
breaking certain components energy production pathway. net
consequence increased cyclic AMP. basically, ingest caffeine,
biasing system towards pro-energetic aspects cellular pathways.
Now really important understand that, biology, even block receptor
prevent activity enzyme and-- least, case, end
cyclic AMP, energy. not really getting energy. actually


borrowing energy overall system frankly nonnegotiable.
mean that? Well, say wake six eight hours sleep
drink lot caffeine keep drinking caffeine throughout day blocking
adenosine receptors. Yes, offset fatigue. offset sleepiness
adenosine simply can't function. point caffeine becomes
dislodged adenosine receptors, will massive glut, backlog
adenosine, will feel extra, extra sleepy. really, no way create
energy system. Really, changing timing
sleepy signals energetic signals arriving. really
important understand backdrop various tools going get
next, can use caffeine enhancing mental performance physical

concept that, wake morning provided slept well enough
night before, levels adenosine will low will ever be.
Actually, order get adenosine levels really bottomed out, want avoid

lowest good night's sleep. really no negotiating accumulation
adenosine going occur going bias towards feeling sleepy
would. Otherwise, going occur throughout day. really no way
eliminate adenosine. can really block function. sort like
borrowing energy fatigue will inevitably feel. Now actually
important socioeconomical relevance. caffeine regularly consumed
human beings, really slaves light/dark cycle. especially true
presence artificial lighting. even advent artificial lighting,
humans largely constrained outside light/dark cycle. need active
day working day, need asleep night. Caffeine
allows us divorce circadian cycle. Circadian just means 24
hour. Caffeine allows us least somewhat way increasing alertness.
is, spiking alertness various times throughout day even night.

important understand that, nowadays, certainly live time

caffeine way negotiate with, borrow natural pattern adenosine
making us sleepy. again, just offsetting effects sleepiness
adenosine causes. can't eliminate adenosine entirely. important point
adenosine pro-sleep molecule nonnegotiable aspect biology. fact,
nonnegotiable that, every 24 hours, going release adenosine,
going release adenosine direct proportion long awake.

use caffeine tool. Now caffeine potent useful tool
enhancing mental health, physical health, performance. certain
considerations one keep mind, particular, dose. Now, first off, not everybody
will respond dose caffeine way, can reliably say
body weight good measure can estimate healthy, useful
dose caffeine be. people, ingesting 1 3 milligrams caffeine per
kilogram body weight going range caffeine can positive
effects without making us feel overly anxious give us feeling jumping
skin turn otherwise positive experience caffeine aversive
one. aren't familiar thinking terms kilograms normally
think pounds, just quickly give general estimations that, instance, 100
kilograms equals 220 pounds. me, weigh 100 kilograms. means 1 3
milligrams-- again, milligrams, thousandth gram. 1 3 milligrams caffeine per
kilogram body weight mean me. safely ingest 100 300 milligrams
caffeine single dose, single drink, way consuming it, pill
form way consuming it. likely will tolerable
dose. However, not somebody accustomed drinking caffeine
regular basis, suggest start lower end 1 3 milligrams per kilogram
body weight range. instance, somebody weighs 50 kilograms,
approximately 110 pounds. pretty comfortable ingesting
somewhere 50 150 milligrams caffeine. recommend
people considering using caffeine tool already ingesting
caffeine, start think dosage caffeine ingesting plan
ingest timing ingest caffeine relative certain tasks throughout
day, waking, sleep. talk just moment.
first step figure much weigh kilograms go
number 1 3 milligrams caffeine per kilogram body weight. good
range might want explore use caffeine single application,
meaning single dose. Now, realize people drinking coffee
day long coffee morning afternoon.
referring ingestion caffeine single bout, right? 1 cup coffee 2
cups coffee, instance, achieve 100 300 milligram range
appropriate body weight. avoid confusion, talk dosage
caffeine, really talking not total amount caffeine ingested per


day. talking total amount caffeine ingested one sitting setting,
is. somebody drinking caffeine multiple times throughout day,
can imagine-- instance, say appropriate dose order get
enhancement mental performance physical performance 200 milligrams.
somebody work morning, want lift
morning able focus better. physical exercise
afternoon vice versa ingest 200 milligrams caffeine two separate
times per day separated four hours. Now don't separate them.
put two hours apart, instance. talk half-life caffeine
forth. Just keep mind that, ingesting 200 milligrams caffeine
appropriate dose based body weight ingesting
another 200 milligrams caffeine hour later, effectively ingesting
approximately 400 milligrams caffeine, going start exceeding dose
can normally tolerate without feeling anxious jittery. said,
range tolerance caffeine based two things. One preexisting

life, much stress experiencing tends make feel anxious
alert jittery ingest caffeine. so-called caffeine-
adapted are. often hear tolerance. Tolerance means something
specific. ability ingest something plateau no
increase actual reduction effectiveness thing. not
really talking tolerance caffeine. talking caffeine-

drink caffeine tends increase heart rate make feel alert
bit anxious, chances not caffeine-adapted, provided
amount caffeine within healthy range you, is, ranges talked
moment ago. However, somebody drinks caffeine actually feel
alert relaxed, chances caffeine-adapted. various times
today's episode, talk people caffeine-adapted people not
caffeine-adapted. talk use caffeine every day. know
habitual caffeine drinkers including myself, just simple mention probably
sounds aversive. actually great utility using caffeine every day
opposed every day. just keep mind people will drink caffeine not
get much lift all. people will drink caffeine, will feel


extremely anxious even dosages far lower 1 3 milligrams per kilogram
body weight range described moment ago. take account
individual differences. said, 1 3 milligrams caffeine per kilogram body weight
given sitting. morning coffee morning yerba maté tea good
range start. encourage go online look various
beverages foods might eating contain caffeine. instance,
people surprised discover coffee get
standard popular vendors there, small coffee medium coffee, instance,
can contain much 400 600 milligrams caffeine. large coffee
often sold commercial vendors can contain much 1 gram, 1,000
milligrams, caffeine. Now may adapted doesn't make

00:53:44 Tool: Delayed Caffeine Intake, Afternoon Crash & Sleep



might already ingesting. first tool like talk one
mentioned podcast several times. something haven't
heard will useful you. heard tool before, going
add additional features description tool make
worthwhile well. delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes
waking days. clear days might want
ingest caffeine closely wake up. want delay
caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking? answer simple.
Many people wake morning. drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes
within 2 minutes waking. feel alert naturally. makes sense
effects caffeine blocking effects adenosine talked
earlier effects neurotransmitter systems. find that,
early afternoon, particular, lunch, experience dramatic dip
overall levels energy, so-called afternoon crash. cases, way
respond ingest caffeine, indeed can increase levels
mood alertness. However, soon talk about, problem ingesting
caffeine afternoon falls within 8 10 dare even say 12 hours going
sleep. is, caffeine ingested afternoon-- everybody, say
95-plus percent people-- disrupts architecture quality nighttime
sleep. say doesn't necessarily impact ability fall asleep
maybe even sleep night depth quality sleep
disrupted consuming caffeine afternoon. little bit later, talk
can offset negative effects absolutely require caffeine
afternoon. huge advantage restricting caffeine intake early
part day not consuming caffeine within first 90 120 minutes
waking. fact, many people find delay caffeine intake 90 120

difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take

thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life

right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit

02:01:55 Dopamine Stacking

reinforcing things led occur occur exercise.

contained episode dopamine, motivation, drive.
pointed that, somebody tends experience difficulty
motivation-- so-called dopamine stacking called might something
want avoid. dopamine stacking? Dopamine stacking combining
highly caffeinated energy drink also includes amino acid tyrosine,
precursor dopamine, plus loud music plus getting really ramped

context caffeine episode just described study using caffeine prior
exercise increases dopamine exercise. might saying, especially
heard earlier episode, wait, isn't dopamine stacking? Aren't
encouraging stack dopamine? Well, sense, yes. keep mind,
not suggesting every time exercise. just earlier
episode, emphasized fact that, stacking multiple stimuli-- caffeine energy

careful. careful, mean pay attention
feel hours days dopamine increase wears off. instance,
ingest caffeine exercise intensely feeling great afterwards
eight hours later next day, feeling little bit low, suggest don't go

let baseline dopamine return normal. again, stacking different things,
chemical behavioral, order increase dopamine can done safe way
beneficial you, depending goals. careful not stacking many

02:06:04 Scheduling Caffeine Maximize Effects

dopamine often. key. Early episode, mentioned one possible
caffeine-consuming schedule works well doesn't fortunately subject
long 20-day bouts 5-day even 2-day bouts abstinence. every

dopamine system performance-enhancing effects period
abstinence can, fact, increase performance-enhancing effects caffeine--
also take consideration caffeine can habit-forming, can develop

caffeine intake somebody close you, realize don't
well caffeine intake arrives even 10, 20, 30 minutes past expected
usual intake caffeine. pretty remarkable, brings mind ideas
all, quote unquote, "addicted caffeine" caffeine somehow bad. certainly
not going make argument caffeine bad. First all, regular caffeine
user. wouldn't call caffeine abuser, regular caffeine user.
caffeine known certain health benefits. listed off earlier,
mention now going forward. Caffeine known certain

00:26:44 Caffeine Effects Brain; Reward Pathways



might even come like smell coffee forth.
caffeine stimulates release certain neurochemicals brain,
particular, dopamine acetylcholine, two neuromodulators increase focus
alertness feelings well-being. little bit later, tell caffeine
stimulates release dopamine way much distinct classical
dopamine pathway associated addiction reward. fact, can think
caffeine somewhat privileged access reward systems. give
bit hint going. Caffeine stimulates release dopamine

interesting frankly almost diabolical way. regularly ingest
caffeine, stimulates increase dopamine receptors multiple sites throughout

also increasing level dopamine receptors reward pathway.
means that, dopamine released response positive

overall feelings drive excitement. four ways caffeine works
need understand. First all, caffeine acts reinforcing agent. increases

00:29:55 Caffeine Reinforcing Agent

occurs awake hours throughout day. talk first
caffeine reinforcing agent. Again, first beautifully demonstrated
study honeybees bees prefer nectars contain caffeine.
makes perfect sense terms ecology bees flowers contain nectar.
advantage, least terms adaptation, flower benefits
distribution things flower, good flowers bees benefit,
getting food. kind symbiosis there.
humans, consuming caffeine-containing beverages sake. don't think
mind, bees mind, frankly, trying preserve
plants provide caffeine. think suffer, say 90% adults
suffer greatly caffeine-containing coffee tea plants gone,
certainly. us not consuming coffees teas caffeine-containing
foods thinking plants come want help
plants. thinking want help ourselves. yet point
reinforcing effects caffeine largely subconscious. not
aware them. Now might say, no, not true. drink caffeine, makes
feel really good. aware makes feel good. order illustrate
reinforcement really works, let give counter example,
aversive agent. reinforcing agents aversive agents. say
compounds nature exist plants aversive. indeed,
are. say compounds present low concentrations
couldn't taste them. say wake morning go
refrigerator open thirsty, reach nice rich red-
containing beverage glass jar. Maybe looks like cranberry juice something
sort. even nice clear glass water. looks like jug water glass
water, drink that. Taste fine you. Maybe even tastes great you.
say 30 minutes later, feel little queasy, feel little off, feel like


going back sleep, just don't feel good. don't know why, nervous
system predictive machine, process back integrates.
say integrates backwards immediate experience preceded not
good feeling. can reliably say much lower probability next
day wake reach beverage
container even. maybe novel environment, maybe staying
Airbnb hotel something sort, might even find don't really like
kitchen consume beverage first place. don't know
why. unless got very, sick day before, unlikely
strong response entirely avoid, instance, water glass jars
containing liquids, et cetera. say went back refrigerator
consume beverage just didn't feel well, felt less good
normally would. Well, even without ability taste beverage even
without understanding happening conscious level,
very, high probability will avoid drinking particular beverage
certainly location volume subsequent days. just
way aversive agents work. work way activating neurons gut
communicate areas brain give us feeling queasiness.
hearing this, pathway association times felt
queasy wanted vomit powerful might even feeling
symptomology now. certain people going increased salivation
precedes vomiting, know class neurons brain relate
area called area postrema actually stimulates vomiting. keep talking
this, probably feel like want vomit, going move
moment. ingest caffeine-containing beverages foods, exact
opposite scenario just described. Caffeine, reinforcer, makes us feel
slightly better lot better immediate minutes hours ingest it.

First all, caffeine called methylxantine. plant alkaloid.
caffeine bitter. Again, give just tiniest little bit pure
caffeine, find extremely aversive. plants snuck
small enough amounts caffeine masked flavor caffeine
flavors bees humans want consume them, don't
know plants think, seem diabolical clever
seeking caffeine-containing plants, beverages, foods even though caffeine
alkaloid very, bitter. Methylxantine-- caffeine-- binds
adenosine receptors. really two types adenosine receptors.
so-called A1 receptors A2 receptors. present different
parts brain body different levels. don't get far receptor
subtypes. importantly understand adenosine makes us feel tired
way taps ATP pathway. ATP pathway central energy
production feelings overall energy brain body cells organ
systems. caffeine binds adenosine receptors, prevents adenosine
breaking certain components energy production pathway. net
consequence increased cyclic AMP. basically, ingest caffeine,
biasing system towards pro-energetic aspects cellular pathways.
Now really important understand that, biology, even block receptor
prevent activity enzyme and-- least, case, end
cyclic AMP, energy. not really getting energy. actually


borrowing energy overall system frankly nonnegotiable.
mean that? Well, say wake six eight hours sleep
drink lot caffeine keep drinking caffeine throughout day blocking
adenosine receptors. Yes, offset fatigue. offset sleepiness
adenosine simply can't function. point caffeine becomes
dislodged adenosine receptors, will massive glut, backlog
adenosine, will feel extra, extra sleepy. really, no way create

borrowing energy fatigue will inevitably feel. Now actually
important socioeconomical relevance. caffeine regularly consumed
human beings, really slaves light/dark cycle. especially true
presence artificial lighting. even advent artificial lighting,
humans largely constrained outside light/dark cycle. need active

00:53:44 Tool: Delayed Caffeine Intake, Afternoon Crash & Sleep



might already ingesting. first tool like talk one
mentioned podcast several times. something haven't
heard will useful you. heard tool before, going
add additional features description tool make
worthwhile well. delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes
waking days. clear days might want
ingest caffeine closely wake up. want delay
caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking? answer simple.
Many people wake morning. drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes
within 2 minutes waking. feel alert naturally. makes sense
effects caffeine blocking effects adenosine talked
earlier effects neurotransmitter systems. find that,
early afternoon, particular, lunch, experience dramatic dip
overall levels energy, so-called afternoon crash. cases, way
respond ingest caffeine, indeed can increase levels
mood alertness. However, soon talk about, problem ingesting
caffeine afternoon falls within 8 10 dare even say 12 hours going
sleep. is, caffeine ingested afternoon-- everybody, say
95-plus percent people-- disrupts architecture quality nighttime
sleep. say doesn't necessarily impact ability fall asleep
maybe even sleep night depth quality sleep
disrupted consuming caffeine afternoon. little bit later, talk
can offset negative effects absolutely require caffeine
afternoon. huge advantage restricting caffeine intake early
part day not consuming caffeine within first 90 120 minutes
waking. fact, many people find delay caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking feel alert morning, completely
avoid afternoon crash. Now said, many people, including myself, need
short nap non-sleep deep rest form relaxation 10 30 minutes
afternoon. natural healthy. not referring need refer
so-called afternoon crash. talking afternoon crash
inability recover energy focus need consume caffeine just make
afternoon. delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking,
couple things accomplished. First all, offset afternoon


crash. effect many people experience first time start
delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. reason
works well following. mentioned earlier, adenosine molecule builds
longer awake. molecule reduced cleared
system sleep. emerge sleep regardless long slept,
adenosine levels lower went sleep previous night.
slept well enough long enough, adenosine levels can very, low,
never completely zero. wake morning, even
one people springs bed ready attack day--
certainly not describing myself. not one people. tend wake fairly slowly.
one spring attack day one people
moves slowly day, regardless, still residual adenosine
system. particularly case not get enough sleep enough
depth sleep night before. correct ratio slow-wave sleep rapid eye
movement sleep. interested optimizing sleep, just refer

episode Huberman Lab podcast. tool kit sleep
available, zero cost, time-stamped, et cetera hubermanlab.com. wake
morning. adenosine levels low, not zero. didn't sleep
well deeply enough night before, going adenosine
system. might think logical thing therefore drink caffeine block
adenosine there. happens accumulation,
sort glut adenosine hangs around. afternoon, effects
caffeine start wear off, will experience so-called afternoon crash.
mentioned earlier, way clear adenosine present
wake morning clear essentially completely without just blocking
receptors letting accumulate hang around. way
deliberately spike cortisol. Now, many heard cortisol, so-called
stress hormone, bad thing. indeed, chronically elevated cortisol bad thing.
depletes immune system. bad psychosocial effects. tends make us
feel anxious on. cortisol not bad. Cortisol wonderful. Cortisol
enhances efficiency immune system. makes us alert focused.
stimulates metabolism. huge number positive things, provided
released circadian fashion. is, appropriate times every 24 hours


tends peak close waking. fact, one reasons wake
morning, assuming weren't woken noise sleeping
environment warm, et cetera, cortisol levels start rise.
shortly waking, cortisol levels will start reach peak. refer
cortisol pulse, just biology nerd speak rise peak cortisol. want
cortisol pulse occur early day close waking, want
couple reasons. First all, don't restrict cortisol pulse early day,
will tend bleed later parts day. actually, late shifted cortisol peak
one hallmark signatures depression, low-level depression, serious
depression. can start disrupt sleep certainly can disrupt mood metabolism
immune system. want cortisol peak early day.
ensure happens? Well, wake morning. whether not
bounce-out-of-bed type groggy, kind wade slowly day
type like am, wake up, don't ingest caffeine. Fine and, fact, beneficial
hydrate water electrolytes. Terrific. fact, say necessary get bright
light eyes ideally sunlight. talked many, many times
podcast. wake sun comes out, turn bright artificial lights.
certainly sun even cloudy days, fact, especially
cloudy days, get outside anywhere 5 20, maybe even 30 minutes.
work outside, take breakfast outside breakfast eater. Get something done
outside even just get outside get bright light eyes. Why? Well,
shown studies humans getting bright light eyes
first hour waking soon possible waking increases peak
cortisol pulse 50%, 5-0. cortisol pulse, yes, increases mood, yes, increases
alertness, one important thing, that, indirect
pathway, can clear residual adenosine might present system
wake morning. Again, going especially important
not getting much sleep much quality sleep
like. going important get morning bright light ideally
sunlight, get cortisol peak going. ways increase cortisol peak
physical activity. don't time full workout, well then, getting
movement-- 10 minutes skipping rope even 5 minutes skipping rope
jumping jacks walking time ideally getting sunlight
eyes. going zero adenosine present system. If,


however, wake immediately drink caffeine-- caffeine can
stimulate release cortisol little bit otherwise present
system. blocking adenosine receptors indirect
effects caffeine cortisol system, actually reducing clearance
adenosine otherwise occur. realize mouthful. Just
clear, wake ingest caffeine right away, blocking adenosine
receptor, not clearing out. also preventing cortisol
normal increase rise can directly clear adenosine cortisol
can clear adenosine. want. want maximum
alertness focus morning throughout day. delaying
caffeine 90 120 minutes waking, set system get
morning cortisol peak. Ideally, peak even greater getting
bright light viewing. ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes
waking, not will craving just little bit, will drinking caffeine
already existing backdrop increased alertness two reasons. One
adenosine zeroed out, cortisol peak higher. now ingest
caffeine, can actually ingest levels caffeine little reasonable
almost certainty going fall 1 3 milligrams per kilogram dosage
will allow feel really alert will carry alertness well afternoon hours
without need drink caffeine thereby will prevent drinking
caffeine disrupting nighttime sleep. And, course, getting better nighttime
sleep, going zero adenosine even more. describing
essentially two tools. telling get morning sunlight maybe
exercise conjunction even brief exercise. main tool delaying
caffeine 90 120 minutes waking immediate effects, also sets motion
cascade domino

01:04:46 Morning Exercise & Residual Caffeine Effects

falls lead better sleep wakefulness next night next day
forth. Now realize people just simply cannot will
not delay caffeine 90 120 minutes waking whatever reason. First off, let
say that, somebody likes wake intense exercise
within first 90 minutes waking, well, case, appropriate


ingest caffeine just prior exercise. Not problem. Not problem.
expect combination drinking caffeine shortly waking plus
exercising intensely shortly waking will increase intensity early
afternoon afternoon fatigue feel. Now people, great thing.
can afford take nap non-sleep deep rest, step away work,
forth. case, strongly encourage whatever allows get
regular exercise regular exercise going beneficial. fact,
entire episode called tool kit fitness describes couple different really
one main structure allows get appropriate amount resistance training
cardiovascular training flexibility training throughout week. happen follow
program, works well. involve workouts
come early morning shortly waking. cases, ingest
caffeine just prior those, within 10, 20 minutes waking. However, days,
personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take
week get there. get there, find quite easy maintain.
thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life
12 hours. means ingest cup coffee say 8:00
AM-- say 100 milligram coffee just sake simplicity, 25%
caffeine action-- wouldn't really say 25 milligrams, 25% caffeine
action will still present 8:00 PM night, pretty remarkable.
long arc caffeine effects, can impede sleep take caffeine
afternoon. again, somebody wakes really need caffeine
right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit
half hour later. will extend arc caffeine
effects don't need afternoon



01:07:56 Tool: Theanine & Jitteriness; Fasting, Intermittent Caffeine Use

won't experience afternoon crash. way caffeine works,
mention that, ingest caffeine empty stomach, will
potent stimulant effect. will also tend increase level jitteriness caffeine
can produce. Later, talk ways offset jitteriness, just tell one
tool now. Many people opt take 100 milligrams theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine, way offset jitteriness. Theanine will reduce jitteriness
caffeine, many energy drink manufacturers even coffee
manufacturers now putting theanine energy drinks ground coffee because,
no surprise, allows people consume beverage thereby purchase
beverage, vendors want without feeling overly anxious
jittery. can take pill form theanine want caffeine. don't tend
that. Rather, control total dosage caffeine. tend consume
caffeine empty stomach restrict caffeine intake early part
day. generally eat first meal somewhere around 11:00 AM,
generally last meal time around 8:00 PM so. averages.
say plus minus hour. not religiously following kind
time-restricted feeding. just tends work best schedule
appetite. again, general theme. days wake
hungry, might ingest something, small snack something. meeting
somebody breakfast, sometimes breakfast. Sometimes won't.
forth. point can get away drinking less caffeine get
stimulant effect empty stomach. somebody likes
exercise empty stomach-- one people-- well then, ingesting
caffeine just prior exercise can fantastic tool. little bit later, talk
physical performance-enhancing effects caffeine. just briefly jump
point relate morning exercise. somebody
regularly ingests caffeine-- can define regularly by, ingested caffeine
every day last two weeks, regular consumer caffeine. Whereas
somebody ingests caffeine somewhere two four times per
week, well then, not regular consumer caffeine. intermittent user
caffeine. Well, somebody regular user caffeine, performance-


enhancing effects caffeine going dramatic take two three days
off drinking caffeine, mind a-- don't want call caffeine
addict regular caffeine user. horrible notion me, aversive notion,
like effects caffeine much. really want see
maximum performance-enhancing effects caffeine, will either one two
things. will either abstain caffeine days three days prior
ingesting caffeine, will use caffeine empty stomach. clear
caffeine empty stomach enhances mental physical enhancing effects
caffeine. And, course, stated backdrop consideration
very, hungry, can make hard concentrate
forth. not encouraging people starve means. Certainly, don't
that. want maximize performance-enhancing effects caffeine,
will consume empty stomach. final point that, caffeine
diuretic. causes us lose fluid and, along fluid, excrete sodium
effects caffeine various processes within kidney. one thing works
well maintain mood alertness longer given certain amount caffeine
intake avoid jitteriness can sometimes feel like crash low blood
sugar feeling even blurry vision make sure consume least equal

Full disclosure, podcast affiliate sponsor. don't need that.
simply just glass water alongside coffee espresso

well hydrate something contains little bit sodium. Obviously, not
much increases hypertension something sort small amount

00:15:23 Caffeine Benefits Mental & Physical Performance

supplements constantly expanding. Again,
livemomentous.com/huberman. talk caffeine. mentioned earlier,
caffeine consumed basically adults every single day consumed
regular times day. fact, take look caffeine intake


caffeine intake somebody close you, realize don't
well caffeine intake arrives even 10, 20, 30 minutes past expected
usual intake caffeine. pretty remarkable, brings mind ideas
all, quote unquote, "addicted caffeine" caffeine somehow bad. certainly
not going make argument caffeine bad. First all, regular caffeine
user. wouldn't call caffeine abuser, regular caffeine user.
caffeine known certain health benefits. listed off earlier,
mention now going forward. Caffeine known certain
neuroprotective effects. ability increase neuromodulators,
dopamine, also so-called catecholamines like norepinephrine.
don't know names mean, molecules increase levels
alertness, motivation, drive. therefore not surprisingly large scale
analyses relationship depression caffeine shows that, provided
people not drinking much caffeine, makes overly anxious, regular
intake caffeine inversely related levels depression. may
antidepressant effects. direct indirect. mean that?
Well, can imagine people ingesting caffeine motivated
work pursue quality social interactions, probability will
depression lower. also direct effects chemical
systems brain relate mood well-being offset depression.
not clear whether not effects caffeine countering depression direct
indirect. Nonetheless, relationship there, interesting positive
one. say negative correlation, positive effect overall mood well-being,
exact. Now also case caffeine can improve mental performance
physical performance. demonstrated tens thousands studies. will
review studies this, particular, today. just give sense
caffeine works level timing impact mental performance physical
performance, ingest caffeine, provided don't lot food
stomach blood sugar isn't particularly high, generally, experience
increase alertness within five minutes. increase focus alertness
peaks around 30 minutes ingestion caffeine persists long 60
minutes. Now assuming one takes caffeine pill form drinks entire
caffeine drink within short period time. little bit later, talk can
consume caffeine regular intervals mental work physical work way


can increase mental performance physical performance. just
touch caffeine intake really mental performance physical
performance. Perhaps robust finding across studies
examined caffeine reduces reaction time. is, improves reaction
time. doesn't make longer. makes shorter. instance, laboratory study
people asked hit lever every time hear tone, can greatly
reduce time tone pressing lever people ingest caffeine
30 minutes task. Now seems like trivial task,
also seen domain sports performance even cognitive performance,
people arrive particular answer question. answer
question pulled memory banks within brain, hippocampus,
instance, brain structure involved memory. asking people,
instance, remember capitals different states cities remember certain
historical facts, will particular rate. ingested caffeine within
hour prior, ability recall information much, much better.
faster, not appear accuracy reduced. fact, many cases, accuracy
enhanced. caffeine works reaction time systems
brain body. talk mechanisms little bit. also stimulates
certain neurotransmitters so-called neuromodulators within brain body
give neural circuits brain associated learning memory lower
threshold activation. mean? means better able
access brain circuitry involved learning memory certain
amount caffeine circulating system. makes caffeine incredible
performance-enhancing compound.

00:20:23 Caffeine Nature & Positive Reinforcement

give tens thousands examples humans.
that, want just touch know existence caffeine nature
existence caffeine nature effects animals tells us
caffeine humans. alluded earlier, caffeine
us not just making us alert, improving memory, improving reaction time,
on. actually acting powerful reinforcer experience. acting
not just powerful reinforcer caffeine-containing drink drink also


mug contained in, plus person might sitting across
consume caffeine, forth. little bit hard
conceptualize reinforcer calling reinforcer, let spell
three specific ways. often hear word reward, think, OK,
certain things like outcome, certain things rewarded. Right?
something, receive praise. praise reward. therefore,
likely thing future. fact, lot parenting like that.
lot life like that. However, hear word reward, often think
something feels good us. certainly, worked hard get
praise, natural praise feel good us. instance, work
hard get certain outcome-- trophy, financial outcome, degree outcome,
recognition, et cetera-- can act rewards, conscious
rewards. aware happening. Reinforcers little bit different
word reinforcement can apply conscious rewards sort just
described, also many ways caffeine stimulates release
chemicals body act reinforcers. reinforcers subconscious.
is, not aware cause preference activities cause
release. study describe beautifully, believe, encapsulates
humans came consume caffeine caffeine exists nature
powerful effects caffeine reinforcing agent animals, insects,
me. title paper "Caffeine floral nectar enhances pollinator's
memory reward." Keep mind caffeine made plants. will
say, duh, think us don't realize reason caffeine
coffee coffee comes plant. coffee bean, certain teas, which,
course, plants people brew. Caffeine contained teas, yerba
maté. Well, bitter substance-- because, fact, caffeine quite bitter
high concentrations. bitter substance something insects
animals want consume all? turns that, plants, caffeine
present small enough quantities insects animals-- fact, can't
actually taste caffeine. give little bit pure caffeine, yes,
stimulant you, say tasted awful. category
compounds strongly stimulate bitter receptors tongue
make cringe pucker essentially walk away whatever contain
caffeine experience contain caffeine. Well, nature, caffeine


present low concentrations masked flavors within flowers, beans,
plants. paper really points caffeine nature acting
reinforcer bees consuming different nectar. way works
bees, course, go flower flower, consuming nectar.
bringing nectar pollen back hive, provides critical nourishment
bee colony. bees foraging way includes information color,
particular, ultraviolet color, things can't see can see,
different photoreceptors do. study shows plants
nectars contain small amounts caffeine preferred sources food
bees. study beautiful able confirm mask
caffeine taste. know bees not preferring taste caffeine.
pair caffeine different food sources bees,
remove caffeine. find bees strongly prefer flavors
contain caffeine, not taste caffeine rather way
caffeine-containing flavors made bees feel. caffeine-
containing flavors make bees feel? way make feel,
little bit alert thereby able work. bee, work
consumption food, reinforcing effect.
really talking fact A, caffeine exists nature, plants. exists
concentrations low, low, fact, not detectable taste
receptors insects, and, many cases, taste receptors humans. And,
course, can high levels caffeine plant. plant also contains
compounds mask flavor caffeine, well then, plants going
essentially even stronger reinforcers flavor plant, OK? now
talking strong flavors plus strong neurostimulant effects caffeine.
important point effects caffeine subconscious. not
bee likes taste caffeine. fact, people, take
first sip coffee, find taste bitter kind noxious. don't like it.
may not even remember happened long ago caffeine
strong reinforcer quickly come like taste coffee. might
even come like feeling mug hand.

00:26:44 Caffeine Effects Brain; Reward Pathways



might even come like smell coffee forth.
caffeine stimulates release certain neurochemicals brain,
particular, dopamine acetylcholine, two neuromodulators increase focus
alertness feelings well-being. little bit later, tell caffeine
stimulates release dopamine way much distinct classical
dopamine pathway associated addiction reward. fact, can think
caffeine somewhat privileged access reward systems. give
bit hint going. Caffeine stimulates release dopamine
acetylcholine not within classic so-called mesolimbic reward pathway. just
fancy nerd speak reward pathways brain. associated things
like sex food drugs abuse, like cocaine methamphetamine. rather,
caffeine seems stimulate release dopamine parts brain
associated alertness cognition, meaning forebrain. important.
multiple dopamine systems brain body, caffeine seems
stimulate dopamine directly within components brain associated
clarity thought well-being, clarity thought. Now, also talking
caffeine strong reinforcer makes feel good overall. does.
suggests also taps classic reward pathway.
interesting frankly almost diabolical way. regularly ingest
caffeine, stimulates increase dopamine receptors multiple sites throughout
brain but, particular, within reward pathways brain. not areas
brain associated focus clarity thought cognition. that,
also increasing level dopamine receptors reward pathway.
means that, dopamine released response positive
experience, social experience, number things can stimulate
dopamine release, receptors, parking spots, will,
dopamine arrive exert increases mood, increases motivation,
overall feelings drive excitement. four ways caffeine works
need understand. First all, caffeine acts reinforcing agent. increases
probability will return engage certain activity consume certain
beverage food. Second all, caffeine increases dopamine acetylcholine,
neuromodulators forebrain, helps us improve ability think,
modify rule sets. is, adjust strategies different social situations

dopamine receptors reward pathways brain. is, makes things
feel pretty good feel even better. fourth, caffeine acts antagonist
adenosine, offsets sleepiness otherwise feel
accumulation adenosine

00:29:55 Caffeine Reinforcing Agent

occurs awake hours throughout day. talk first
caffeine reinforcing agent. Again, first beautifully demonstrated
study honeybees bees prefer nectars contain caffeine.
makes perfect sense terms ecology bees flowers contain nectar.
advantage, least terms adaptation, flower benefits
distribution things flower, good flowers bees benefit,
getting food. kind symbiosis there.
humans, consuming caffeine-containing beverages sake. don't think
mind, bees mind, frankly, trying preserve
plants provide caffeine. think suffer, say 90% adults
suffer greatly caffeine-containing coffee tea plants gone,
certainly. us not consuming coffees teas caffeine-containing
foods thinking plants come want help
plants. thinking want help ourselves. yet point
reinforcing effects caffeine largely subconscious. not
aware them. Now might say, no, not true. drink caffeine, makes
feel really good. aware makes feel good. order illustrate
reinforcement really works, let give counter example,
aversive agent. reinforcing agents aversive agents. say
compounds nature exist plants aversive. indeed,
are. say compounds present low concentrations
couldn't taste them. say wake morning go
refrigerator open thirsty, reach nice rich red-
containing beverage glass jar. Maybe looks like cranberry juice something
sort. even nice clear glass water. looks like jug water glass
water, drink that. Taste fine you. Maybe even tastes great you.
say 30 minutes later, feel little queasy, feel little off, feel like


going back sleep, just don't feel good. don't know why, nervous
system predictive machine, process back integrates.
say integrates backwards immediate experience preceded not
good feeling. can reliably say much lower probability next
day wake reach beverage
container even. maybe novel environment, maybe staying
Airbnb hotel something sort, might even find don't really like
kitchen consume beverage first place. don't know
why. unless got very, sick day before, unlikely
strong response entirely avoid, instance, water glass jars
containing liquids, et cetera. say went back refrigerator
consume beverage just didn't feel well, felt less good
normally would. Well, even without ability taste beverage even
without understanding happening conscious level,
very, high probability will avoid drinking particular beverage
certainly location volume subsequent days. just
way aversive agents work. work way activating neurons gut
communicate areas brain give us feeling queasiness.
hearing this, pathway association times felt
queasy wanted vomit powerful might even feeling
symptomology now. certain people going increased salivation
precedes vomiting, know class neurons brain relate
area called area postrema actually stimulates vomiting. keep talking
this, probably feel like want vomit, going move
moment. ingest caffeine-containing beverages foods, exact
opposite scenario just described. Caffeine, reinforcer, makes us feel
slightly better lot better immediate minutes hours ingest it.
acting reinforcing agent not just effects caffeine
things preceded ingestion caffeine, return
caffeine-containing beverages, coffee tea maybe even foods
contain caffeine, even taste foods not something
otherwise consider, especially delicious. fact, people take first
sip coffee tea caffeine-containing beverage, find bitter.
not taste caffeine. taste beverage


independent caffeine. However, caffeine present there, come
prefer taste tastes. fact, will, mentioned earlier, will invest
lot financial resources time energy make sure get beverage.
trying make sure not get taste get
caffeine. positively reinforcing. taste therefore takes new
significance, new meaning, come associate positive. fact,
us, including myself, love taste espresso, love taste coffee, love taste
yerba maté even initial taste, first time consume beverage,
either neutral negative. reinforcing properties
caffeine. then, course, direct actions caffeine. is,
faster actions caffeine. just list off briefly
mind going forward, caffeine also increases release dopamine
acetylcholine, neuromodulators forebrain, increases clarity
thought ability rule switch, ability move one context another
change understand rules engagement, social engagement, physical
engagement, mental engagement, forth. mentioned before, caffeine also
increases number dopamine receptors reward pathway, good
thing happens you. positive experience will potent
effect feelings well-being. last certainly not least, caffeine acts

briefly talk adenosine molecular features. again, don't
background biology, don't worry. promise make clear everyone.
First all, caffeine called methylxantine. plant alkaloid.
caffeine bitter. Again, give just tiniest little bit pure
caffeine, find extremely aversive. plants snuck
small enough amounts caffeine masked flavor caffeine
flavors bees humans want consume them, don't
know plants think, seem diabolical clever
seeking caffeine-containing plants, beverages, foods even though caffeine
alkaloid very, bitter. Methylxantine-- caffeine-- binds
adenosine receptors. really two types adenosine receptors.
so-called A1 receptors A2 receptors. present different
parts brain body different levels. don't get far receptor
subtypes. importantly understand adenosine makes us feel tired
way taps ATP pathway. ATP pathway central energy
production feelings overall energy brain body cells organ
systems. caffeine binds adenosine receptors, prevents adenosine
breaking certain components energy production pathway. net
consequence increased cyclic AMP. basically, ingest caffeine,
biasing system towards pro-energetic aspects cellular pathways.
Now really important understand that, biology, even block receptor
prevent activity enzyme and-- least, case, end
cyclic AMP, energy. not really getting energy. actually


borrowing energy overall system frankly nonnegotiable.
mean that? Well, say wake six eight hours sleep
drink lot caffeine keep drinking caffeine throughout day blocking
adenosine receptors. Yes, offset fatigue. offset sleepiness
adenosine simply can't function. point caffeine becomes
dislodged adenosine receptors, will massive glut, backlog
adenosine, will feel extra, extra sleepy. really, no way create
energy system. Really, changing timing
sleepy signals energetic signals arriving. really
important understand backdrop various tools going get
next, can use caffeine enhancing mental performance physical
performance aspects health. important understand
concept that, wake morning provided slept well enough
night before, levels adenosine will low will ever be.
Actually, order get adenosine levels really bottomed out, want avoid
caffeine first 90 120 minutes waking. talk
turns way completely clear adenosine system hour

lowest good night's sleep. really no negotiating accumulation
adenosine going occur going bias towards feeling sleepy
would. Otherwise, going occur throughout day. really no way
eliminate adenosine. can really block function. sort like
borrowing energy fatigue will inevitably feel. Now actually
important socioeconomical relevance. caffeine regularly consumed
human beings, really slaves light/dark cycle. especially true
presence artificial lighting. even advent artificial lighting,
humans largely constrained outside light/dark cycle. need active
day working day, need asleep night. Caffeine
allows us divorce circadian cycle. Circadian just means 24
hour. Caffeine allows us least somewhat way increasing alertness.
is, spiking alertness various times throughout day even night.

yet used advent caffeine-containing beverages that,
sleepy afternoon, either take nap battle sleepiness,

important understand that, nowadays, certainly live time

caffeine way negotiate with, borrow natural pattern adenosine
making us sleepy. again, just offsetting effects sleepiness
adenosine causes. can't eliminate adenosine entirely. important point
adenosine pro-sleep molecule nonnegotiable aspect biology. fact,
nonnegotiable that, every 24 hours, going release adenosine,
going release adenosine direct proportion long awake.

enhancing mental health, physical health, performance. certain
considerations one keep mind, particular, dose. Now, first off, not everybody
will respond dose caffeine way, can reliably say

dose caffeine be. people, ingesting 1 3 milligrams caffeine per
kilogram body weight going range caffeine can positive

skin turn otherwise positive experience caffeine aversive
one. aren't familiar thinking terms kilograms normally
think pounds, just quickly give general estimations that, instance, 100
kilograms equals 220 pounds. me, weigh 100 kilograms. means 1 3
milligrams-- again, milligrams, thousandth gram. 1 3 milligrams caffeine per
kilogram body weight mean me. safely ingest 100 300 milligrams
caffeine single dose, single drink, way consuming it, pill
form way consuming it. likely will tolerable
dose. However, not somebody accustomed drinking caffeine
regular basis, suggest start lower end 1 3 milligrams per kilogram
body weight range. instance, somebody weighs 50 kilograms,
approximately 110 pounds. pretty comfortable ingesting
somewhere 50 150 milligrams caffeine. recommend
people considering using caffeine tool already ingesting
caffeine, start think dosage caffeine ingesting plan
ingest timing ingest caffeine relative certain tasks throughout
day, waking, sleep. talk just moment.
first step figure much weigh kilograms go
number 1 3 milligrams caffeine per kilogram body weight. good
range might want explore use caffeine single application,
meaning single dose. Now, realize people drinking coffee
day long coffee morning afternoon.
referring ingestion caffeine single bout, right? 1 cup coffee 2
cups coffee, instance, achieve 100 300 milligram range
appropriate body weight. avoid confusion, talk dosage
caffeine, really talking not total amount caffeine ingested per


day. talking total amount caffeine ingested one sitting setting,
is. somebody drinking caffeine multiple times throughout day,
can imagine-- instance, say appropriate dose order get
enhancement mental performance physical performance 200 milligrams.
somebody work morning, want lift
morning able focus better. physical exercise
afternoon vice versa ingest 200 milligrams caffeine two separate
times per day separated four hours. Now don't separate them.
put two hours apart, instance. talk half-life caffeine
forth. Just keep mind that, ingesting 200 milligrams caffeine
appropriate dose based body weight ingesting

today's episode, talk people caffeine-adapted people not

habitual caffeine drinkers including myself, just simple mention probably
sounds aversive. actually great utility using caffeine every day
opposed every day. just keep mind people will drink caffeine not
get much lift all. people will drink caffeine, will feel


extremely anxious even dosages far lower 1 3 milligrams per kilogram
body weight range described moment ago. take account
individual differences. said, 1 3 milligrams caffeine per kilogram body weight

waking days. clear days might want
ingest caffeine closely wake up. want delay
caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking? answer simple.
Many people wake morning. drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes
within 2 minutes waking. feel alert naturally. makes sense
effects caffeine blocking effects adenosine talked
earlier effects neurotransmitter systems. find that,
early afternoon, particular, lunch, experience dramatic dip
overall levels energy, so-called afternoon crash. cases, way
respond ingest caffeine, indeed can increase levels
mood alertness. However, soon talk about, problem ingesting
caffeine afternoon falls within 8 10 dare even say 12 hours going
sleep. is, caffeine ingested afternoon-- everybody, say
95-plus percent people-- disrupts architecture quality nighttime
sleep. say doesn't necessarily impact ability fall asleep
maybe even sleep night depth quality sleep
disrupted consuming caffeine afternoon. little bit later, talk
can offset negative effects absolutely require caffeine
afternoon. huge advantage restricting caffeine intake early
part day not consuming caffeine within first 90 120 minutes
waking. fact, many people find delay caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking feel alert morning, completely
avoid afternoon crash. Now said, many people, including myself, need

forth. Now realize people just simply cannot will
not delay caffeine 90 120 minutes waking whatever reason. First off, let
say that, somebody likes wake intense exercise
within first 90 minutes waking, well, case, appropriate


ingest caffeine just prior exercise. Not problem. Not problem.
expect combination drinking caffeine shortly waking plus
exercising intensely shortly waking will increase intensity early
afternoon afternoon fatigue feel. Now people, great thing.

come early morning shortly waking. cases, ingest
caffeine just prior those, within 10, 20 minutes waking. However, days,
personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take
week get there. get there, find quite easy maintain.
thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life
12 hours. means ingest cup coffee say 8:00
AM-- say 100 milligram coffee just sake simplicity, 25%
caffeine action-- wouldn't really say 25 milligrams, 25% caffeine
action will still present 8:00 PM night, pretty remarkable.
long arc caffeine effects, can impede sleep take caffeine
afternoon. again, somebody wakes really need caffeine
right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit
half hour later. will extend arc caffeine
effects don't need afternoon

01:56:34 Tool: Exercise, Caffeine, Dopamine & Positive Reinforcement

Put comment section would. appreciate that. another


important potent use caffeine enhancing performance. relates not just
dopamine epinephrine arousal-inducing effects caffeine.
doesn't even just relate effect caffeine enhancing frontal lobe function.
include that, also includes reinforcing effects caffeine
talked beginning episode. best way illustrate

highlighting here, also increases reinforcement pathways associated
exercise. is, creates positive feeling general theme engaging
exercise, creates general positive experience things follow exercise.
think this, nothing else call support idea, ingesting caffeine
performance-enhancing tool makes perfect sense. don't
enjoy exercise, particular, certain forms exercise, ingesting caffeine can change
relationship exercise. words, make positive, much
way ingesting caffeine alongside certain taste otherwise
neutral maybe even negative can actually make taste particular drink

contained episode dopamine, motivation, drive.
pointed that, somebody tends experience difficulty

livemomentous.com/huberman. talk caffeine. mentioned earlier,
caffeine consumed basically adults every single day consumed
regular times day. fact, take look caffeine intake


caffeine intake somebody close you, realize don't
well caffeine intake arrives even 10, 20, 30 minutes past expected
usual intake caffeine. pretty remarkable, brings mind ideas
all, quote unquote, "addicted caffeine" caffeine somehow bad. certainly
not going make argument caffeine bad. First all, regular caffeine
user. wouldn't call caffeine abuser, regular caffeine user.
caffeine known certain health benefits. listed off earlier,
mention now going forward. Caffeine known certain
neuroprotective effects. ability increase neuromodulators,
dopamine, also so-called catecholamines like norepinephrine.
don't know names mean, molecules increase levels
alertness, motivation, drive. therefore not surprisingly large scale
analyses relationship depression caffeine shows that, provided
people not drinking much caffeine, makes overly anxious, regular
intake caffeine inversely related levels depression. may
antidepressant effects. direct indirect. mean that?
Well, can imagine people ingesting caffeine motivated
work pursue quality social interactions, probability will
depression lower. also direct effects chemical
systems brain relate mood well-being offset depression.
not clear whether not effects caffeine countering depression direct
indirect. Nonetheless, relationship there, interesting positive
one. say negative correlation, positive effect overall mood well-being,
exact. Now also case caffeine can improve mental performance
physical performance. demonstrated tens thousands studies. will
review studies this, particular, today. just give sense
caffeine works level timing impact mental performance physical
performance, ingest caffeine, provided don't lot food
stomach blood sugar isn't particularly high, generally, experience
increase alertness within five minutes. increase focus alertness
peaks around 30 minutes ingestion caffeine persists long 60
minutes. Now assuming one takes caffeine pill form drinks entire
caffeine drink within short period time. little bit later, talk can
consume caffeine regular intervals mental work physical work way


can increase mental performance physical performance. just
touch caffeine intake really mental performance physical
performance. Perhaps robust finding across studies
examined caffeine reduces reaction time. is, improves reaction
time. doesn't make longer. makes shorter. instance, laboratory study
people asked hit lever every time hear tone, can greatly
reduce time tone pressing lever people ingest caffeine
30 minutes task. Now seems like trivial task,
also seen domain sports performance even cognitive performance,
people arrive particular answer question. answer
question pulled memory banks within brain, hippocampus,
instance, brain structure involved memory. asking people,
instance, remember capitals different states cities remember certain
historical facts, will particular rate. ingested caffeine within
hour prior, ability recall information much, much better.
faster, not appear accuracy reduced. fact, many cases, accuracy
enhanced. caffeine works reaction time systems
brain body. talk mechanisms little bit. also stimulates
certain neurotransmitters so-called neuromodulators within brain body
give neural circuits brain associated learning memory lower
threshold activation. mean? means better able
access brain circuitry involved learning memory certain
amount caffeine circulating system. makes caffeine incredible
performance-enhancing compound.

00:20:23 Caffeine Nature & Positive Reinforcement

conceptualize reinforcer calling reinforcer, let spell
three specific ways. often hear word reward, think, OK,
certain things like outcome, certain things rewarded. Right?
something, receive praise. praise reward. therefore,
likely thing future. fact, lot parenting like that.
lot life like that. However, hear word reward, often think
something feels good us. certainly, worked hard get
praise, natural praise feel good us. instance, work
hard get certain outcome-- trophy, financial outcome, degree outcome,
recognition, et cetera-- can act rewards, conscious
rewards. aware happening. Reinforcers little bit different
word reinforcement can apply conscious rewards sort just
described, also many ways caffeine stimulates release

00:26:44 Caffeine Effects Brain; Reward Pathways



might even come like smell coffee forth.
caffeine stimulates release certain neurochemicals brain,
particular, dopamine acetylcholine, two neuromodulators increase focus
alertness feelings well-being. little bit later, tell caffeine
stimulates release dopamine way much distinct classical
dopamine pathway associated addiction reward. fact, can think
caffeine somewhat privileged access reward systems. give
bit hint going. Caffeine stimulates release dopamine
acetylcholine not within classic so-called mesolimbic reward pathway. just
fancy nerd speak reward pathways brain. associated things
like sex food drugs abuse, like cocaine methamphetamine. rather,
caffeine seems stimulate release dopamine parts brain
associated alertness cognition, meaning forebrain. important.
multiple dopamine systems brain body, caffeine seems
stimulate dopamine directly within components brain associated
clarity thought well-being, clarity thought. Now, also talking
caffeine strong reinforcer makes feel good overall. does.
suggests also taps classic reward pathway.
interesting frankly almost diabolical way. regularly ingest
caffeine, stimulates increase dopamine receptors multiple sites throughout
brain but, particular, within reward pathways brain. not areas
brain associated focus clarity thought cognition. that,
also increasing level dopamine receptors reward pathway.
means that, dopamine released response positive

reinforcing effects caffeine largely subconscious. not
aware them. Now might say, no, not true. drink caffeine, makes
feel really good. aware makes feel good. order illustrate
reinforcement really works, let give counter example,
aversive agent. reinforcing agents aversive agents. say
compounds nature exist plants aversive. indeed,
are. say compounds present low concentrations
couldn't taste them. say wake morning go
refrigerator open thirsty, reach nice rich red-
containing beverage glass jar. Maybe looks like cranberry juice something
sort. even nice clear glass water. looks like jug water glass
water, drink that. Taste fine you. Maybe even tastes great you.
say 30 minutes later, feel little queasy, feel little off, feel like


going back sleep, just don't feel good. don't know why, nervous
system predictive machine, process back integrates.
say integrates backwards immediate experience preceded not

way aversive agents work. work way activating neurons gut

briefly talk adenosine molecular features. again, don't
background biology, don't worry. promise make clear everyone.
First all, caffeine called methylxantine. plant alkaloid.
caffeine bitter. Again, give just tiniest little bit pure
caffeine, find extremely aversive. plants snuck
small enough amounts caffeine masked flavor caffeine
flavors bees humans want consume them, don't
know plants think, seem diabolical clever
seeking caffeine-containing plants, beverages, foods even though caffeine
alkaloid very, bitter. Methylxantine-- caffeine-- binds
adenosine receptors. really two types adenosine receptors.
so-called A1 receptors A2 receptors. present different
parts brain body different levels. don't get far receptor
subtypes. importantly understand adenosine makes us feel tired
way taps ATP pathway. ATP pathway central energy
production feelings overall energy brain body cells organ
systems. caffeine binds adenosine receptors, prevents adenosine
breaking certain components energy production pathway. net
consequence increased cyclic AMP. basically, ingest caffeine,
biasing system towards pro-energetic aspects cellular pathways.
Now really important understand that, biology, even block receptor
prevent activity enzyme and-- least, case, end
cyclic AMP, energy. not really getting energy. actually


borrowing energy overall system frankly nonnegotiable.
mean that? Well, say wake six eight hours sleep
drink lot caffeine keep drinking caffeine throughout day blocking
adenosine receptors. Yes, offset fatigue. offset sleepiness
adenosine simply can't function. point caffeine becomes
dislodged adenosine receptors, will massive glut, backlog
adenosine, will feel extra, extra sleepy. really, no way create
energy system. Really, changing timing
sleepy signals energetic signals arriving. really
important understand backdrop various tools going get
next, can use caffeine enhancing mental performance physical

Actually, order get adenosine levels really bottomed out, want avoid

eliminate adenosine. can really block function. sort like
borrowing energy fatigue will inevitably feel. Now actually
important socioeconomical relevance. caffeine regularly consumed
human beings, really slaves light/dark cycle. especially true
presence artificial lighting. even advent artificial lighting,
humans largely constrained outside light/dark cycle. need active
day working day, need asleep night. Caffeine
allows us divorce circadian cycle. Circadian just means 24

approximately 110 pounds. pretty comfortable ingesting
somewhere 50 150 milligrams caffeine. recommend
people considering using caffeine tool already ingesting
caffeine, start think dosage caffeine ingesting plan
ingest timing ingest caffeine relative certain tasks throughout

00:53:44 Tool: Delayed Caffeine Intake, Afternoon Crash & Sleep



might already ingesting. first tool like talk one
mentioned podcast several times. something haven't
heard will useful you. heard tool before, going
add additional features description tool make
worthwhile well. delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes
waking days. clear days might want
ingest caffeine closely wake up. want delay
caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking? answer simple.
Many people wake morning. drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes
within 2 minutes waking. feel alert naturally. makes sense
effects caffeine blocking effects adenosine talked
earlier effects neurotransmitter systems. find that,
early afternoon, particular, lunch, experience dramatic dip
overall levels energy, so-called afternoon crash. cases, way
respond ingest caffeine, indeed can increase levels
mood alertness. However, soon talk about, problem ingesting
caffeine afternoon falls within 8 10 dare even say 12 hours going
sleep. is, caffeine ingested afternoon-- everybody, say
95-plus percent people-- disrupts architecture quality nighttime
sleep. say doesn't necessarily impact ability fall asleep
maybe even sleep night depth quality sleep
disrupted consuming caffeine afternoon. little bit later, talk
can offset negative effects absolutely require caffeine
afternoon. huge advantage restricting caffeine intake early
part day not consuming caffeine within first 90 120 minutes
waking. fact, many people find delay caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking feel alert morning, completely
avoid afternoon crash. Now said, many people, including myself, need
short nap non-sleep deep rest form relaxation 10 30 minutes
afternoon. natural healthy. not referring need refer
so-called afternoon crash. talking afternoon crash
inability recover energy focus need consume caffeine just make
afternoon. delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking,
couple things accomplished. First all, offset afternoon


crash. effect many people experience first time start
delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. reason
works well following. mentioned earlier, adenosine molecule builds
longer awake. molecule reduced cleared
system sleep. emerge sleep regardless long slept,
adenosine levels lower went sleep previous night.
slept well enough long enough, adenosine levels can very, low,
never completely zero. wake morning, even
one people springs bed ready attack day--
certainly not describing myself. not one people. tend wake fairly slowly.
one spring attack day one people
moves slowly day, regardless, still residual adenosine
system. particularly case not get enough sleep enough
depth sleep night before. correct ratio slow-wave sleep rapid eye
movement sleep. interested optimizing sleep, just refer
master sleep episode Huberman Lab podcast, perfect sleep
episode Huberman Lab podcast. tool kit sleep
available, zero cost, time-stamped, et cetera hubermanlab.com. wake
morning. adenosine levels low, not zero. didn't sleep
well deeply enough night before, going adenosine
system. might think logical thing therefore drink caffeine block
adenosine there. happens accumulation,
sort glut adenosine hangs around. afternoon, effects
caffeine start wear off, will experience so-called afternoon crash.
mentioned earlier, way clear adenosine present
wake morning clear essentially completely without just blocking
receptors letting accumulate hang around. way
deliberately spike cortisol. Now, many heard cortisol, so-called
stress hormone, bad thing. indeed, chronically elevated cortisol bad thing.
depletes immune system. bad psychosocial effects. tends make us
feel anxious on. cortisol not bad. Cortisol wonderful. Cortisol
enhances efficiency immune system. makes us alert focused.
stimulates metabolism. huge number positive things, provided
released circadian fashion. is, appropriate times every 24 hours


tends peak close waking. fact, one reasons wake
morning, assuming weren't woken noise sleeping
environment warm, et cetera, cortisol levels start rise.
shortly waking, cortisol levels will start reach peak. refer
cortisol pulse, just biology nerd speak rise peak cortisol. want
cortisol pulse occur early day close waking, want
couple reasons. First all, don't restrict cortisol pulse early day,
will tend bleed later parts day. actually, late shifted cortisol peak
one hallmark signatures depression, low-level depression, serious
depression. can start disrupt sleep certainly can disrupt mood metabolism
immune system. want cortisol peak early day.
ensure happens? Well, wake morning. whether not
bounce-out-of-bed type groggy, kind wade slowly day
type like am, wake up, don't ingest caffeine. Fine and, fact, beneficial
hydrate water electrolytes. Terrific. fact, say necessary get bright
light eyes ideally sunlight. talked many, many times
podcast. wake sun comes out, turn bright artificial lights.
certainly sun even cloudy days, fact, especially
cloudy days, get outside anywhere 5 20, maybe even 30 minutes.
work outside, take breakfast outside breakfast eater. Get something done
outside even just get outside get bright light eyes. Why? Well,
shown studies humans getting bright light eyes
first hour waking soon possible waking increases peak
cortisol pulse 50%, 5-0. cortisol pulse, yes, increases mood, yes, increases
alertness, one important thing, that, indirect
pathway, can clear residual adenosine might present system
wake morning. Again, going especially important
not getting much sleep much quality sleep
like. going important get morning bright light ideally
sunlight, get cortisol peak going. ways increase cortisol peak
physical activity. don't time full workout, well then, getting
movement-- 10 minutes skipping rope even 5 minutes skipping rope
jumping jacks walking time ideally getting sunlight
eyes. going zero adenosine present system. If,


however, wake immediately drink caffeine-- caffeine can
stimulate release cortisol little bit otherwise present
system. blocking adenosine receptors indirect
effects caffeine cortisol system, actually reducing clearance
adenosine otherwise occur. realize mouthful. Just
clear, wake ingest caffeine right away, blocking adenosine
receptor, not clearing out. also preventing cortisol
normal increase rise can directly clear adenosine cortisol
can clear adenosine. want. want maximum
alertness focus morning throughout day. delaying
caffeine 90 120 minutes waking, set system get
morning cortisol peak. Ideally, peak even greater getting
bright light viewing. ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes
waking, not will craving just little bit, will drinking caffeine
already existing backdrop increased alertness two reasons. One
adenosine zeroed out, cortisol peak higher. now ingest
caffeine, can actually ingest levels caffeine little reasonable
almost certainty going fall 1 3 milligrams per kilogram dosage
will allow feel really alert will carry alertness well afternoon hours
without need drink caffeine thereby will prevent drinking
caffeine disrupting nighttime sleep. And, course, getting better nighttime
sleep, going zero adenosine even more. describing
essentially two tools. telling get morning sunlight maybe
exercise conjunction even brief exercise. main tool delaying
caffeine 90 120 minutes waking immediate effects, also sets motion
cascade domino

01:04:46 Morning Exercise & Residual Caffeine Effects

falls lead better sleep wakefulness next night next day
forth. Now realize people just simply cannot will
not delay caffeine 90 120 minutes waking whatever reason. First off, let
say that, somebody likes wake intense exercise
within first 90 minutes waking, well, case, appropriate


ingest caffeine just prior exercise. Not problem. Not problem.
expect combination drinking caffeine shortly waking plus
exercising intensely shortly waking will increase intensity early
afternoon afternoon fatigue feel. Now people, great thing.
can afford take nap non-sleep deep rest, step away work,
forth. case, strongly encourage whatever allows get
regular exercise regular exercise going beneficial. fact,
entire episode called tool kit fitness describes couple different really
one main structure allows get appropriate amount resistance training
cardiovascular training flexibility training throughout week. happen follow
program, works well. involve workouts
come early morning shortly waking. cases, ingest
caffeine just prior those, within 10, 20 minutes waking. However, days,
personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take
week get there. get there, find quite easy maintain.
thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life
12 hours. means ingest cup coffee say 8:00
AM-- say 100 milligram coffee just sake simplicity, 25%
caffeine action-- wouldn't really say 25 milligrams, 25% caffeine
action will still present 8:00 PM night, pretty remarkable.
long arc caffeine effects, can impede sleep take caffeine
afternoon. again, somebody wakes really need caffeine
right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit
half hour later. will extend arc caffeine
effects don't need afternoon



01:07:56 Tool: Theanine & Jitteriness; Fasting, Intermittent Caffeine Use

won't experience afternoon crash. way caffeine works,
mention that, ingest caffeine empty stomach, will
potent stimulant effect. will also tend increase level jitteriness caffeine
can produce. Later, talk ways offset jitteriness, just tell one
tool now. Many people opt take 100 milligrams theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine, way offset jitteriness. Theanine will reduce jitteriness
caffeine, many energy drink manufacturers even coffee
manufacturers now putting theanine energy drinks ground coffee because,
no surprise, allows people consume beverage thereby purchase
beverage, vendors want without feeling overly anxious
jittery. can take pill form theanine want caffeine. don't tend
that. Rather, control total dosage caffeine. tend consume
caffeine empty stomach restrict caffeine intake early part
day. generally eat first meal somewhere around 11:00 AM,
generally last meal time around 8:00 PM so. averages.
say plus minus hour. not religiously following kind
time-restricted feeding. just tends work best schedule
appetite. again, general theme. days wake
hungry, might ingest something, small snack something. meeting
somebody breakfast, sometimes breakfast. Sometimes won't.
forth. point can get away drinking less caffeine get
stimulant effect empty stomach. somebody likes
exercise empty stomach-- one people-- well then, ingesting
caffeine just prior exercise can fantastic tool. little bit later, talk
physical performance-enhancing effects caffeine. just briefly jump
point relate morning exercise. somebody
regularly ingests caffeine-- can define regularly by, ingested caffeine
every day last two weeks, regular consumer caffeine. Whereas
somebody ingests caffeine somewhere two four times per
week, well then, not regular consumer caffeine. intermittent user
caffeine. Well, somebody regular user caffeine, performance-


enhancing effects caffeine going dramatic take two three days
off drinking caffeine, mind a-- don't want call caffeine
addict regular caffeine user. horrible notion me, aversive notion,
like effects caffeine much. really want see
maximum performance-enhancing effects caffeine, will either one two
things. will either abstain caffeine days three days prior
ingesting caffeine, will use caffeine empty stomach. clear
caffeine empty stomach enhances mental physical enhancing effects
caffeine. And, course, stated backdrop consideration
very, hungry, can make hard concentrate
forth. not encouraging people starve means. Certainly, don't
that. want maximize performance-enhancing effects caffeine,
will consume empty stomach. final point that, caffeine
diuretic. causes us lose fluid and, along fluid, excrete sodium
effects caffeine various processes within kidney. one thing works
well maintain mood alertness longer given certain amount caffeine
intake avoid jitteriness can sometimes feel like crash low blood
sugar feeling even blurry vision make sure consume least equal

pinch salt sort electrolyte drink-- powder, rather. me, use element.
Full disclosure, podcast affiliate sponsor. don't need that.
simply just glass water alongside coffee espresso

low. can case, oftentimes, simply excretion
sodium occurred ingested caffeine. encourage hydrate
well hydrate something contains little bit sodium. Obviously, not
much increases hypertension something sort small amount
sodium electrolyte drink like Element. electrolyte drinks
can accomplish same, course. Just couple quick notes

00:15:23 Caffeine Benefits Mental & Physical Performance

supplements constantly expanding. Again,
livemomentous.com/huberman. talk caffeine. mentioned earlier,
caffeine consumed basically adults every single day consumed
regular times day. fact, take look caffeine intake


caffeine intake somebody close you, realize don't
well caffeine intake arrives even 10, 20, 30 minutes past expected
usual intake caffeine. pretty remarkable, brings mind ideas
all, quote unquote, "addicted caffeine" caffeine somehow bad. certainly
not going make argument caffeine bad. First all, regular caffeine
user. wouldn't call caffeine abuser, regular caffeine user.
caffeine known certain health benefits. listed off earlier,
mention now going forward. Caffeine known certain
neuroprotective effects. ability increase neuromodulators,
dopamine, also so-called catecholamines like norepinephrine.
don't know names mean, molecules increase levels
alertness, motivation, drive. therefore not surprisingly large scale
analyses relationship depression caffeine shows that, provided
people not drinking much caffeine, makes overly anxious, regular
intake caffeine inversely related levels depression. may
antidepressant effects. direct indirect. mean that?
Well, can imagine people ingesting caffeine motivated
work pursue quality social interactions, probability will
depression lower. also direct effects chemical
systems brain relate mood well-being offset depression.
not clear whether not effects caffeine countering depression direct
indirect. Nonetheless, relationship there, interesting positive
one. say negative correlation, positive effect overall mood well-being,
exact. Now also case caffeine can improve mental performance
physical performance. demonstrated tens thousands studies. will
review studies this, particular, today. just give sense
caffeine works level timing impact mental performance physical
performance, ingest caffeine, provided don't lot food
stomach blood sugar isn't particularly high, generally, experience
increase alertness within five minutes. increase focus alertness
peaks around 30 minutes ingestion caffeine persists long 60
minutes. Now assuming one takes caffeine pill form drinks entire
caffeine drink within short period time. little bit later, talk can
consume caffeine regular intervals mental work physical work way


can increase mental performance physical performance. just
touch caffeine intake really mental performance physical
performance. Perhaps robust finding across studies
examined caffeine reduces reaction time. is, improves reaction
time. doesn't make longer. makes shorter. instance, laboratory study
people asked hit lever every time hear tone, can greatly
reduce time tone pressing lever people ingest caffeine
30 minutes task. Now seems like trivial task,
also seen domain sports performance even cognitive performance,
people arrive particular answer question. answer
question pulled memory banks within brain, hippocampus,
instance, brain structure involved memory. asking people,
instance, remember capitals different states cities remember certain
historical facts, will particular rate. ingested caffeine within
hour prior, ability recall information much, much better.
faster, not appear accuracy reduced. fact, many cases, accuracy
enhanced. caffeine works reaction time systems
brain body. talk mechanisms little bit. also stimulates
certain neurotransmitters so-called neuromodulators within brain body
give neural circuits brain associated learning memory lower
threshold activation. mean? means better able
access brain circuitry involved learning memory certain
amount caffeine circulating system. makes caffeine incredible
performance-enhancing compound.

00:20:23 Caffeine Nature & Positive Reinforcement

give tens thousands examples humans.
that, want just touch know existence caffeine nature
existence caffeine nature effects animals tells us
caffeine humans. alluded earlier, caffeine
us not just making us alert, improving memory, improving reaction time,
on. actually acting powerful reinforcer experience. acting
not just powerful reinforcer caffeine-containing drink drink also


mug contained in, plus person might sitting across
consume caffeine, forth. little bit hard
conceptualize reinforcer calling reinforcer, let spell
three specific ways. often hear word reward, think, OK,
certain things like outcome, certain things rewarded. Right?
something, receive praise. praise reward. therefore,
likely thing future. fact, lot parenting like that.
lot life like that. However, hear word reward, often think
something feels good us. certainly, worked hard get
praise, natural praise feel good us. instance, work
hard get certain outcome-- trophy, financial outcome, degree outcome,
recognition, et cetera-- can act rewards, conscious
rewards. aware happening. Reinforcers little bit different
word reinforcement can apply conscious rewards sort just
described, also many ways caffeine stimulates release
chemicals body act reinforcers. reinforcers subconscious.
is, not aware cause preference activities cause
release. study describe beautifully, believe, encapsulates
humans came consume caffeine caffeine exists nature
powerful effects caffeine reinforcing agent animals, insects,
me. title paper "Caffeine floral nectar enhances pollinator's
memory reward." Keep mind caffeine made plants. will
say, duh, think us don't realize reason caffeine
coffee coffee comes plant. coffee bean, certain teas, which,
course, plants people brew. Caffeine contained teas, yerba
maté. Well, bitter substance-- because, fact, caffeine quite bitter
high concentrations. bitter substance something insects
animals want consume all? turns that, plants, caffeine
present small enough quantities insects animals-- fact, can't
actually taste caffeine. give little bit pure caffeine, yes,
stimulant you, say tasted awful. category
compounds strongly stimulate bitter receptors tongue
make cringe pucker essentially walk away whatever contain
caffeine experience contain caffeine. Well, nature, caffeine


present low concentrations masked flavors within flowers, beans,
plants. paper really points caffeine nature acting
reinforcer bees consuming different nectar. way works
bees, course, go flower flower, consuming nectar.
bringing nectar pollen back hive, provides critical nourishment
bee colony. bees foraging way includes information color,
particular, ultraviolet color, things can't see can see,
different photoreceptors do. study shows plants
nectars contain small amounts caffeine preferred sources food
bees. study beautiful able confirm mask
caffeine taste. know bees not preferring taste caffeine.
pair caffeine different food sources bees,
remove caffeine. find bees strongly prefer flavors
contain caffeine, not taste caffeine rather way
caffeine-containing flavors made bees feel. caffeine-
containing flavors make bees feel? way make feel,
little bit alert thereby able work. bee, work
consumption food, reinforcing effect.
really talking fact A, caffeine exists nature, plants. exists
concentrations low, low, fact, not detectable taste
receptors insects, and, many cases, taste receptors humans. And,
course, can high levels caffeine plant. plant also contains
compounds mask flavor caffeine, well then, plants going
essentially even stronger reinforcers flavor plant, OK? now
talking strong flavors plus strong neurostimulant effects caffeine.
important point effects caffeine subconscious. not
bee likes taste caffeine. fact, people, take
first sip coffee, find taste bitter kind noxious. don't like it.
may not even remember happened long ago caffeine
strong reinforcer quickly come like taste coffee. might
even come like feeling mug hand.

00:26:44 Caffeine Effects Brain; Reward Pathways



might even come like smell coffee forth.
caffeine stimulates release certain neurochemicals brain,
particular, dopamine acetylcholine, two neuromodulators increase focus
alertness feelings well-being. little bit later, tell caffeine
stimulates release dopamine way much distinct classical
dopamine pathway associated addiction reward. fact, can think
caffeine somewhat privileged access reward systems. give
bit hint going. Caffeine stimulates release dopamine
acetylcholine not within classic so-called mesolimbic reward pathway. just
fancy nerd speak reward pathways brain. associated things
like sex food drugs abuse, like cocaine methamphetamine. rather,
caffeine seems stimulate release dopamine parts brain
associated alertness cognition, meaning forebrain. important.
multiple dopamine systems brain body, caffeine seems
stimulate dopamine directly within components brain associated
clarity thought well-being, clarity thought. Now, also talking
caffeine strong reinforcer makes feel good overall. does.
suggests also taps classic reward pathway.
interesting frankly almost diabolical way. regularly ingest
caffeine, stimulates increase dopamine receptors multiple sites throughout
brain but, particular, within reward pathways brain. not areas
brain associated focus clarity thought cognition. that,
also increasing level dopamine receptors reward pathway.
means that, dopamine released response positive
experience, social experience, number things can stimulate
dopamine release, receptors, parking spots, will,
dopamine arrive exert increases mood, increases motivation,
overall feelings drive excitement. four ways caffeine works
need understand. First all, caffeine acts reinforcing agent. increases
probability will return engage certain activity consume certain
beverage food. Second all, caffeine increases dopamine acetylcholine,
neuromodulators forebrain, helps us improve ability think,
modify rule sets. is, adjust strategies different social situations
mental demands physical demands. third, increases number efficacy


dopamine receptors reward pathways brain. is, makes things
feel pretty good feel even better. fourth, caffeine acts antagonist
adenosine, offsets sleepiness otherwise feel
accumulation adenosine

00:29:55 Caffeine Reinforcing Agent

occurs awake hours throughout day. talk first
caffeine reinforcing agent. Again, first beautifully demonstrated
study honeybees bees prefer nectars contain caffeine.
makes perfect sense terms ecology bees flowers contain nectar.
advantage, least terms adaptation, flower benefits
distribution things flower, good flowers bees benefit,
getting food. kind symbiosis there.
humans, consuming caffeine-containing beverages sake. don't think
mind, bees mind, frankly, trying preserve
plants provide caffeine. think suffer, say 90% adults
suffer greatly caffeine-containing coffee tea plants gone,
certainly. us not consuming coffees teas caffeine-containing
foods thinking plants come want help
plants. thinking want help ourselves. yet point
reinforcing effects caffeine largely subconscious. not
aware them. Now might say, no, not true. drink caffeine, makes
feel really good. aware makes feel good. order illustrate
reinforcement really works, let give counter example,
aversive agent. reinforcing agents aversive agents. say
compounds nature exist plants aversive. indeed,
are. say compounds present low concentrations
couldn't taste them. say wake morning go
refrigerator open thirsty, reach nice rich red-
containing beverage glass jar. Maybe looks like cranberry juice something
sort. even nice clear glass water. looks like jug water glass
water, drink that. Taste fine you. Maybe even tastes great you.
say 30 minutes later, feel little queasy, feel little off, feel like


going back sleep, just don't feel good. don't know why, nervous
system predictive machine, process back integrates.
say integrates backwards immediate experience preceded not
good feeling. can reliably say much lower probability next
day wake reach beverage
container even. maybe novel environment, maybe staying
Airbnb hotel something sort, might even find don't really like
kitchen consume beverage first place. don't know
why. unless got very, sick day before, unlikely
strong response entirely avoid, instance, water glass jars
containing liquids, et cetera. say went back refrigerator
consume beverage just didn't feel well, felt less good
normally would. Well, even without ability taste beverage even
without understanding happening conscious level,
very, high probability will avoid drinking particular beverage
certainly location volume subsequent days. just
way aversive agents work. work way activating neurons gut
communicate areas brain give us feeling queasiness.
hearing this, pathway association times felt
queasy wanted vomit powerful might even feeling
symptomology now. certain people going increased salivation
precedes vomiting, know class neurons brain relate
area called area postrema actually stimulates vomiting. keep talking
this, probably feel like want vomit, going move
moment. ingest caffeine-containing beverages foods, exact
opposite scenario just described. Caffeine, reinforcer, makes us feel
slightly better lot better immediate minutes hours ingest it.
acting reinforcing agent not just effects caffeine
things preceded ingestion caffeine, return
caffeine-containing beverages, coffee tea maybe even foods
contain caffeine, even taste foods not something
otherwise consider, especially delicious. fact, people take first
sip coffee tea caffeine-containing beverage, find bitter.
not taste caffeine. taste beverage


independent caffeine. However, caffeine present there, come
prefer taste tastes. fact, will, mentioned earlier, will invest
lot financial resources time energy make sure get beverage.
trying make sure not get taste get
caffeine. positively reinforcing. taste therefore takes new
significance, new meaning, come associate positive. fact,
us, including myself, love taste espresso, love taste coffee, love taste
yerba maté even initial taste, first time consume beverage,
either neutral negative. reinforcing properties
caffeine. then, course, direct actions caffeine. is,
faster actions caffeine. just list off briefly
mind going forward, caffeine also increases release dopamine
acetylcholine, neuromodulators forebrain, increases clarity
thought ability rule switch, ability move one context another
change understand rules engagement, social engagement, physical
engagement, mental engagement, forth. mentioned before, caffeine also
increases number dopamine receptors reward pathway, good
thing happens you. positive experience will potent
effect feelings well-being. last certainly not least, caffeine acts
adenosine antagonist. reduces feelings lethargy fatigue desire

get five free travel packs year supply Vitamin D3K2. like just
briefly talk adenosine molecular features. again, don't
background biology, don't worry. promise make clear everyone.
First all, caffeine called methylxantine. plant alkaloid.
caffeine bitter. Again, give just tiniest little bit pure
caffeine, find extremely aversive. plants snuck
small enough amounts caffeine masked flavor caffeine
flavors bees humans want consume them, don't
know plants think, seem diabolical clever
seeking caffeine-containing plants, beverages, foods even though caffeine
alkaloid very, bitter. Methylxantine-- caffeine-- binds
adenosine receptors. really two types adenosine receptors.
so-called A1 receptors A2 receptors. present different
parts brain body different levels. don't get far receptor
subtypes. importantly understand adenosine makes us feel tired
way taps ATP pathway. ATP pathway central energy
production feelings overall energy brain body cells organ
systems. caffeine binds adenosine receptors, prevents adenosine
breaking certain components energy production pathway. net
consequence increased cyclic AMP. basically, ingest caffeine,
biasing system towards pro-energetic aspects cellular pathways.
Now really important understand that, biology, even block receptor
prevent activity enzyme and-- least, case, end
cyclic AMP, energy. not really getting energy. actually


borrowing energy overall system frankly nonnegotiable.
mean that? Well, say wake six eight hours sleep
drink lot caffeine keep drinking caffeine throughout day blocking
adenosine receptors. Yes, offset fatigue. offset sleepiness
adenosine simply can't function. point caffeine becomes
dislodged adenosine receptors, will massive glut, backlog
adenosine, will feel extra, extra sleepy. really, no way create
energy system. Really, changing timing
sleepy signals energetic signals arriving. really
important understand backdrop various tools going get
next, can use caffeine enhancing mental performance physical
performance aspects health. important understand
concept that, wake morning provided slept well enough
night before, levels adenosine will low will ever be.
Actually, order get adenosine levels really bottomed out, want avoid
caffeine first 90 120 minutes waking. talk
turns way completely clear adenosine system hour
waking. people, adenosine levels going close
lowest good night's sleep. really no negotiating accumulation
adenosine going occur going bias towards feeling sleepy
would. Otherwise, going occur throughout day. really no way
eliminate adenosine. can really block function. sort like
borrowing energy fatigue will inevitably feel. Now actually
important socioeconomical relevance. caffeine regularly consumed
human beings, really slaves light/dark cycle. especially true
presence artificial lighting. even advent artificial lighting,
humans largely constrained outside light/dark cycle. need active
day working day, need asleep night. Caffeine
allows us divorce circadian cycle. Circadian just means 24
hour. Caffeine allows us least somewhat way increasing alertness.
is, spiking alertness various times throughout day even night.
can shift workers, instance, can sleep day
drink strong cup coffee 8:00 PM work night. ability
completely transformed society. Now, course, healthiest schedule--


know certainty. healthiest schedule brain body going alert
daytime asleep night. no question that. Shift workers run
sorts health problems. thank shift workers important
work do. need you. Air traffic controllers, paramedics, firefighters, police
officers, et cetera. know serious health consequences, negative
health consequences, is, shift workers. people there, 95%
people follow typical schedule. awake day asleep night.
yet used advent caffeine-containing beverages that,
sleepy afternoon, either take nap battle sleepiness,
activity rhythms sleep rhythms governed circadian changes
availability sunlight slept. just didn't ability ingest
beverage increase levels alertness block adenosine.
important understand that, nowadays, certainly live time
use-- fact, 90% adults half adolescents teenagers use
caffeine way negotiate with, borrow natural pattern adenosine
making us sleepy. again, just offsetting effects sleepiness
adenosine causes. can't eliminate adenosine entirely. important point
adenosine pro-sleep molecule nonnegotiable aspect biology. fact,
nonnegotiable that, every 24 hours, going release adenosine,
going release adenosine direct proportion long awake.
longer awake, adenosine circulating system.
really handful ways completely clear adenosine. major one
get sleep. take short nap, which, course, sleep, shallow
sleep. non-sleep deep rest, so-called NSDR, shown reduce levels

use caffeine tool. Now caffeine potent useful tool
enhancing mental health, physical health, performance. certain
considerations one keep mind, particular, dose. Now, first off, not everybody
will respond dose caffeine way, can reliably say
body weight good measure can estimate healthy, useful
dose caffeine be. people, ingesting 1 3 milligrams caffeine per
kilogram body weight going range caffeine can positive
effects without making us feel overly anxious give us feeling jumping
skin turn otherwise positive experience caffeine aversive
one. aren't familiar thinking terms kilograms normally
think pounds, just quickly give general estimations that, instance, 100
kilograms equals 220 pounds. me, weigh 100 kilograms. means 1 3
milligrams-- again, milligrams, thousandth gram. 1 3 milligrams caffeine per
kilogram body weight mean me. safely ingest 100 300 milligrams
caffeine single dose, single drink, way consuming it, pill
form way consuming it. likely will tolerable
dose. However, not somebody accustomed drinking caffeine
regular basis, suggest start lower end 1 3 milligrams per kilogram
body weight range. instance, somebody weighs 50 kilograms,
approximately 110 pounds. pretty comfortable ingesting
somewhere 50 150 milligrams caffeine. recommend
people considering using caffeine tool already ingesting
caffeine, start think dosage caffeine ingesting plan
ingest timing ingest caffeine relative certain tasks throughout
day, waking, sleep. talk just moment.
first step figure much weigh kilograms go
number 1 3 milligrams caffeine per kilogram body weight. good
range might want explore use caffeine single application,
meaning single dose. Now, realize people drinking coffee
day long coffee morning afternoon.
referring ingestion caffeine single bout, right? 1 cup coffee 2
cups coffee, instance, achieve 100 300 milligram range
appropriate body weight. avoid confusion, talk dosage
caffeine, really talking not total amount caffeine ingested per


day. talking total amount caffeine ingested one sitting setting,
is. somebody drinking caffeine multiple times throughout day,
can imagine-- instance, say appropriate dose order get
enhancement mental performance physical performance 200 milligrams.
somebody work morning, want lift
morning able focus better. physical exercise
afternoon vice versa ingest 200 milligrams caffeine two separate
times per day separated four hours. Now don't separate them.
put two hours apart, instance. talk half-life caffeine
forth. Just keep mind that, ingesting 200 milligrams caffeine
appropriate dose based body weight ingesting
another 200 milligrams caffeine hour later, effectively ingesting
approximately 400 milligrams caffeine, going start exceeding dose
can normally tolerate without feeling anxious jittery. said,
range tolerance caffeine based two things. One preexisting
disposition whether not genetics nervous system backdrop
life, much stress experiencing tends make feel anxious
alert jittery ingest caffeine. so-called caffeine-
adapted are. often hear tolerance. Tolerance means something
specific. ability ingest something plateau no
increase actual reduction effectiveness thing. not
really talking tolerance caffeine. talking caffeine-
adapted. simple way understand whether not caffeine-adapted not that,
drink caffeine tends increase heart rate make feel alert
bit anxious, chances not caffeine-adapted, provided
amount caffeine within healthy range you, is, ranges talked
moment ago. However, somebody drinks caffeine actually feel
alert relaxed, chances caffeine-adapted. various times
today's episode, talk people caffeine-adapted people not
caffeine-adapted. talk use caffeine every day. know
habitual caffeine drinkers including myself, just simple mention probably
sounds aversive. actually great utility using caffeine every day
opposed every day. just keep mind people will drink caffeine not
get much lift all. people will drink caffeine, will feel


extremely anxious even dosages far lower 1 3 milligrams per kilogram
body weight range described moment ago. take account
individual differences. said, 1 3 milligrams caffeine per kilogram body weight
given sitting. morning coffee morning yerba maté tea good
range start. encourage go online look various
beverages foods might eating contain caffeine. instance,
people surprised discover coffee get
standard popular vendors there, small coffee medium coffee, instance,
can contain much 400 600 milligrams caffeine. large coffee
often sold commercial vendors can contain much 1 gram, 1,000
milligrams, caffeine. Now may adapted doesn't make

information discover levels caffeine actually ingesting. Now
happen ingesting 1 3 milligrams per kilogram body weight
caffeine, not necessarily bad. However, want careful ingesting
high levels caffeine long periods time life can

appear ingest high levels caffeine exceeding dosages
normally get away get just much mental-enhancing physical-

00:53:44 Tool: Delayed Caffeine Intake, Afternoon Crash & Sleep



might already ingesting. first tool like talk one
mentioned podcast several times. something haven't
heard will useful you. heard tool before, going
add additional features description tool make
worthwhile well. delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes
waking days. clear days might want
ingest caffeine closely wake up. want delay
caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking? answer simple.
Many people wake morning. drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes
within 2 minutes waking. feel alert naturally. makes sense
effects caffeine blocking effects adenosine talked
earlier effects neurotransmitter systems. find that,
early afternoon, particular, lunch, experience dramatic dip
overall levels energy, so-called afternoon crash. cases, way
respond ingest caffeine, indeed can increase levels
mood alertness. However, soon talk about, problem ingesting
caffeine afternoon falls within 8 10 dare even say 12 hours going
sleep. is, caffeine ingested afternoon-- everybody, say
95-plus percent people-- disrupts architecture quality nighttime
sleep. say doesn't necessarily impact ability fall asleep
maybe even sleep night depth quality sleep
disrupted consuming caffeine afternoon. little bit later, talk
can offset negative effects absolutely require caffeine
afternoon. huge advantage restricting caffeine intake early
part day not consuming caffeine within first 90 120 minutes
waking. fact, many people find delay caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking feel alert morning, completely
avoid afternoon crash. Now said, many people, including myself, need
short nap non-sleep deep rest form relaxation 10 30 minutes
afternoon. natural healthy. not referring need refer
so-called afternoon crash. talking afternoon crash
inability recover energy focus need consume caffeine just make
afternoon. delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking,
couple things accomplished. First all, offset afternoon


crash. effect many people experience first time start
delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. reason
works well following. mentioned earlier, adenosine molecule builds
longer awake. molecule reduced cleared
system sleep. emerge sleep regardless long slept,
adenosine levels lower went sleep previous night.
slept well enough long enough, adenosine levels can very, low,
never completely zero. wake morning, even
one people springs bed ready attack day--
certainly not describing myself. not one people. tend wake fairly slowly.
one spring attack day one people
moves slowly day, regardless, still residual adenosine
system. particularly case not get enough sleep enough
depth sleep night before. correct ratio slow-wave sleep rapid eye
movement sleep. interested optimizing sleep, just refer
master sleep episode Huberman Lab podcast, perfect sleep
episode Huberman Lab podcast. tool kit sleep
available, zero cost, time-stamped, et cetera hubermanlab.com. wake
morning. adenosine levels low, not zero. didn't sleep
well deeply enough night before, going adenosine
system. might think logical thing therefore drink caffeine block
adenosine there. happens accumulation,
sort glut adenosine hangs around. afternoon, effects
caffeine start wear off, will experience so-called afternoon crash.
mentioned earlier, way clear adenosine present
wake morning clear essentially completely without just blocking
receptors letting accumulate hang around. way
deliberately spike cortisol. Now, many heard cortisol, so-called
stress hormone, bad thing. indeed, chronically elevated cortisol bad thing.
depletes immune system. bad psychosocial effects. tends make us
feel anxious on. cortisol not bad. Cortisol wonderful. Cortisol
enhances efficiency immune system. makes us alert focused.
stimulates metabolism. huge number positive things, provided
released circadian fashion. is, appropriate times every 24 hours


tends peak close waking. fact, one reasons wake
morning, assuming weren't woken noise sleeping
environment warm, et cetera, cortisol levels start rise.
shortly waking, cortisol levels will start reach peak. refer
cortisol pulse, just biology nerd speak rise peak cortisol. want
cortisol pulse occur early day close waking, want
couple reasons. First all, don't restrict cortisol pulse early day,
will tend bleed later parts day. actually, late shifted cortisol peak
one hallmark signatures depression, low-level depression, serious
depression. can start disrupt sleep certainly can disrupt mood metabolism
immune system. want cortisol peak early day.
ensure happens? Well, wake morning. whether not
bounce-out-of-bed type groggy, kind wade slowly day
type like am, wake up, don't ingest caffeine. Fine and, fact, beneficial
hydrate water electrolytes. Terrific. fact, say necessary get bright
light eyes ideally sunlight. talked many, many times
podcast. wake sun comes out, turn bright artificial lights.
certainly sun even cloudy days, fact, especially
cloudy days, get outside anywhere 5 20, maybe even 30 minutes.
work outside, take breakfast outside breakfast eater. Get something done
outside even just get outside get bright light eyes. Why? Well,
shown studies humans getting bright light eyes
first hour waking soon possible waking increases peak
cortisol pulse 50%, 5-0. cortisol pulse, yes, increases mood, yes, increases
alertness, one important thing, that, indirect
pathway, can clear residual adenosine might present system
wake morning. Again, going especially important
not getting much sleep much quality sleep
like. going important get morning bright light ideally
sunlight, get cortisol peak going. ways increase cortisol peak
physical activity. don't time full workout, well then, getting
movement-- 10 minutes skipping rope even 5 minutes skipping rope
jumping jacks walking time ideally getting sunlight
eyes. going zero adenosine present system. If,


however, wake immediately drink caffeine-- caffeine can
stimulate release cortisol little bit otherwise present
system. blocking adenosine receptors indirect
effects caffeine cortisol system, actually reducing clearance
adenosine otherwise occur. realize mouthful. Just

01:56:34 Tool: Exercise, Caffeine, Dopamine & Positive Reinforcement

Put comment section would. appreciate that. another


important potent use caffeine enhancing performance. relates not just
dopamine epinephrine arousal-inducing effects caffeine.
doesn't even just relate effect caffeine enhancing frontal lobe function.
include that, also includes reinforcing effects caffeine
talked beginning episode. best way illustrate
performance-enhancing effects caffeine stem directly association
reinforcement highlight study. title study "Blood dopamine level
enhanced caffeine men treadmill running." title suggests,
carried men, no reason think results wouldn't also
present women. sex-dependent effects caffeine. touch just
briefly end. largely present kids. is, adolescents teens
opposed adults. study really interesting. people
run treadmill either ingest caffeine-- again, 3 milligrams per kilogram body
weight-- not ingest caffeine. looked levels dopamine
neurotransmitters hormones, prolactin cortisol. basic takeaway
is, title suggests, exercise, own, can increase cortisol healthy
ways, provided not intense long. little note here, trouble
recovering exercise want continue derive benefits exercise,
general, best not high-intensity exercise longer 75 minutes. 90 minutes
probably outer threshold. realized genetic freaks
people chemically assisted can recover intense long
bouts exercise. people don't well long bouts intense exercise
regular basis. limiting intense exercise 60 minutes less-- doesn't
include warm-up-- going beneficial. See episode tool kit fitness
like details that. Exercise known increase levels dopamine, cortisol,
catecholamines neurotransmitters potently things like testosterone
estrogen ways know beneficial us and, course,
positive effects musculoskeletal system cardiovascular effects.
unbeknownst people, ingesting 3 milligrams per kilogram caffeine prior
exercise increases dopamine release associated exercise specifically.
two important effects. First all, increase dopamine great
provides long-lasting increase focus alertness motivation, not just
exercise, also exercise. second, it-- is, caffeine
dopamine combination-- act reinforcer make experience exercise


period immediate exercise pleasant and, fact, reinforcing.
words, one way enjoy exercise enjoy activities follow exercise
experience genuine increase dopamine beneficial mood
alertness ingest caffeine prior exercise. Now important number
people exercising, love exercise, love eating great, love
things beneficial health, number people really don't
like exercise. serves serious block willingness
consistency exercise. Ingesting caffeine gives us energy exercise. increases
release neurochemicals hormones good us exercise.
highlighting here, also increases reinforcement pathways associated
exercise. is, creates positive feeling general theme engaging
exercise, creates general positive experience things follow exercise.
think this, nothing else call support idea, ingesting caffeine
performance-enhancing tool makes perfect sense. don't
enjoy exercise, particular, certain forms exercise, ingesting caffeine can change
relationship exercise. words, make positive, much
way ingesting caffeine alongside certain taste otherwise
neutral maybe even negative can actually make taste particular drink
food positive. again, brings us back reinforcing properties caffeine
subconscious. not just enhanced performance test
enhanced performance treadmill weights gym. enhanced
feelings mood well-being genuine effect caffeine
certain neurotransmitter hormone systems, also creating overall milieu

02:01:55 Dopamine Stacking

reinforcing things led occur occur exercise.
want point something important relates combining things like
caffeine exercise order increase dopamine. something came
episode dopamine, motivation, drive, turns one
popular episodes. Again, can find hubermanlab.com links
formats time stamps, et cetera. also came episode ADHD
relationship ADHD dopamine. notion dopamine
stacking. episode dopamine, motivation, drive, pointed that,


near-infinite number things can increase dopamine release,
notably positive surprise positive anticipation experiencing win. Certainly,
compounds, drugs abuse, food, sex, certain supplements can
increase dopamine varying levels varying degrees, healthy unhealthy.
contained episode dopamine, motivation, drive.
pointed that, somebody tends experience difficulty
motivation-- so-called dopamine stacking called might something
want avoid. dopamine stacking? Dopamine stacking combining
highly caffeinated energy drink also includes amino acid tyrosine,
precursor dopamine, plus loud music plus getting really ramped
intense workout. can great every while.
will quickly find extent dopamine peaks also dictates extent
dopamine will drop peak. say drop, mean drop
baseline. lot people find that, stack lot things peak
dopamine, experience low, take time return
baseline. highly recommend not engaging activities consuming compounds
attempt accelerate return baseline will drive
baseline lower lower. requires able tolerate drop dopamine
baseline period time, et cetera. Now reason bringing now
context caffeine episode just described study using caffeine prior
exercise increases dopamine exercise. might saying, especially
heard earlier episode, wait, isn't dopamine stacking? Aren't
encouraging stack dopamine? Well, sense, yes. keep mind,
not suggesting every time exercise. just earlier
episode, emphasized fact that, stacking multiple stimuli-- caffeine energy
drinks music et cetera-- exercise mental work experience
matter OK every people, don't want get
habit consistently every time exercise every time go out,
instance. really want cautious. is, want protect
baseline levels dopamine peak levels dopamine. said, people
want experience increase mood, alertness, performance, want
condition themselves-- really is. conditioning
reinforcing effects dopamine increase liking maybe even loving
exercise. Occasionally, using caffeine frequently using caffeine prior exercise fine


careful. careful, mean pay attention
feel hours days dopamine increase wears off. instance,
ingest caffeine exercise intensely feeling great afterwards
eight hours later next day, feeling little bit low, suggest don't go
back exact thing right away. give little bit time
let baseline dopamine return normal. again, stacking different things,
chemical behavioral, order increase dopamine can done safe way
beneficial you, depending goals. careful not stacking many
stimuli

02:06:04 Scheduling Caffeine Maximize Effects

dopamine often. key. Early episode, mentioned one possible
caffeine-consuming schedule works well doesn't fortunately subject
long 20-day bouts 5-day even 2-day bouts abstinence. every
day schedule caffeine. look half-life caffeine look effects
dopamine system performance-enhancing effects period
abstinence can, fact, increase performance-enhancing effects caffeine--
also take consideration caffeine can habit-forming, can develop
sort tolerance caffeine. Well then, emerges
person consumes caffeine every day can actually help maximize
positive effects caffeine without subjecting kind misery occurs
accustomed consuming caffeine every single day suddenly go 2
5 20-day abstinence. never tried every day caffeine
approach, although considering based literature read.
considering specific way, consume caffeine
days resistance train. since tend three four days
per week organized way every day-- again, want see
exercise schedule follow, including cardiovascular exercise weight training
reasons rationale maps scientific literature,
relate health span lifespan, vitality, et cetera, can find

rational one one wants maximize performance-enhancing effects


caffeine without suffering effects caffeine withdrawal associated
regular consumer caffeine stopping caffeine intake,
headache irritability forth. Not anyone life wants experience

every-other-day caffeine schedule

02:08:33 Pro-Health Effects Caffeine

seem rational scientifically grounded one order maximize
effects. addition so-called performance-enhancing effects caffeine,
also well studied now fairly well mechanistically understood pro-health
effects caffeine. Now, talk pro-health effects caffeine, want
clear that, schedule caffeine intake-- is, timing caffeine
intake anything else matter-- offsets getting regular high quality sleep
sufficient duration, well, undermining pro-health effects thing.
true exercise. true caffeine. true supplementation.

said, several well described health-promoting effects caffeine ingestion.
again, say caffeine ingestion, referring 1 3 milligrams per

caffeine intake somebody close you, realize don't
well caffeine intake arrives even 10, 20, 30 minutes past expected
usual intake caffeine. pretty remarkable, brings mind ideas
all, quote unquote, "addicted caffeine" caffeine somehow bad. certainly
not going make argument caffeine bad. First all, regular caffeine
user. wouldn't call caffeine abuser, regular caffeine user.
caffeine known certain health benefits. listed off earlier,
mention now going forward. Caffeine known certain
neuroprotective effects. ability increase neuromodulators,
dopamine, also so-called catecholamines like norepinephrine.
don't know names mean, molecules increase levels
alertness, motivation, drive. therefore not surprisingly large scale
analyses relationship depression caffeine shows that, provided
people not drinking much caffeine, makes overly anxious, regular
intake caffeine inversely related levels depression. may
antidepressant effects. direct indirect. mean that?
Well, can imagine people ingesting caffeine motivated
work pursue quality social interactions, probability will
depression lower. also direct effects chemical
systems brain relate mood well-being offset depression.
not clear whether not effects caffeine countering depression direct
indirect. Nonetheless, relationship there, interesting positive
one. say negative correlation, positive effect overall mood well-being,
exact. Now also case caffeine can improve mental performance
physical performance. demonstrated tens thousands studies. will
review studies this, particular, today. just give sense
caffeine works level timing impact mental performance physical
performance, ingest caffeine, provided don't lot food
stomach blood sugar isn't particularly high, generally, experience
increase alertness within five minutes. increase focus alertness
peaks around 30 minutes ingestion caffeine persists long 60
minutes. Now assuming one takes caffeine pill form drinks entire
caffeine drink within short period time. little bit later, talk can
consume caffeine regular intervals mental work physical work way


can increase mental performance physical performance. just
touch caffeine intake really mental performance physical
performance. Perhaps robust finding across studies
examined caffeine reduces reaction time. is, improves reaction
time. doesn't make longer. makes shorter. instance, laboratory study
people asked hit lever every time hear tone, can greatly
reduce time tone pressing lever people ingest caffeine
30 minutes task. Now seems like trivial task,
also seen domain sports performance even cognitive performance,
people arrive particular answer question. answer
question pulled memory banks within brain, hippocampus,
instance, brain structure involved memory. asking people,
instance, remember capitals different states cities remember certain
historical facts, will particular rate. ingested caffeine within
hour prior, ability recall information much, much better.
faster, not appear accuracy reduced. fact, many cases, accuracy
enhanced. caffeine works reaction time systems
brain body. talk mechanisms little bit. also stimulates
certain neurotransmitters so-called neuromodulators within brain body
give neural circuits brain associated learning memory lower
threshold activation. mean? means better able
access brain circuitry involved learning memory certain
amount caffeine circulating system. makes caffeine incredible
performance-enhancing compound.

00:20:23 Caffeine Nature & Positive Reinforcement

give tens thousands examples humans.
that, want just touch know existence caffeine nature
existence caffeine nature effects animals tells us
caffeine humans. alluded earlier, caffeine
us not just making us alert, improving memory, improving reaction time,
on. actually acting powerful reinforcer experience. acting
not just powerful reinforcer caffeine-containing drink drink also


mug contained in, plus person might sitting across
consume caffeine, forth. little bit hard
conceptualize reinforcer calling reinforcer, let spell
three specific ways. often hear word reward, think, OK,
certain things like outcome, certain things rewarded. Right?
something, receive praise. praise reward. therefore,
likely thing future. fact, lot parenting like that.
lot life like that. However, hear word reward, often think
something feels good us. certainly, worked hard get
praise, natural praise feel good us. instance, work
hard get certain outcome-- trophy, financial outcome, degree outcome,
recognition, et cetera-- can act rewards, conscious
rewards. aware happening. Reinforcers little bit different
word reinforcement can apply conscious rewards sort just
described, also many ways caffeine stimulates release
chemicals body act reinforcers. reinforcers subconscious.
is, not aware cause preference activities cause
release. study describe beautifully, believe, encapsulates
humans came consume caffeine caffeine exists nature
powerful effects caffeine reinforcing agent animals, insects,
me. title paper "Caffeine floral nectar enhances pollinator's

say, duh, think us don't realize reason caffeine
coffee coffee comes plant. coffee bean, certain teas, which,
course, plants people brew. Caffeine contained teas, yerba
maté. Well, bitter substance-- because, fact, caffeine quite bitter
high concentrations. bitter substance something insects
animals want consume all? turns that, plants, caffeine
present small enough quantities insects animals-- fact, can't
actually taste caffeine. give little bit pure caffeine, yes,
stimulant you, say tasted awful. category

present low concentrations masked flavors within flowers, beans,
plants. paper really points caffeine nature acting
reinforcer bees consuming different nectar. way works
bees, course, go flower flower, consuming nectar.
bringing nectar pollen back hive, provides critical nourishment
bee colony. bees foraging way includes information color,
particular, ultraviolet color, things can't see can see,
different photoreceptors do. study shows plants
nectars contain small amounts caffeine preferred sources food
bees. study beautiful able confirm mask
caffeine taste. know bees not preferring taste caffeine.
pair caffeine different food sources bees,
remove caffeine. find bees strongly prefer flavors
contain caffeine, not taste caffeine rather way
caffeine-containing flavors made bees feel. caffeine-

little bit alert thereby able work. bee, work
consumption food, reinforcing effect.
really talking fact A, caffeine exists nature, plants. exists
concentrations low, low, fact, not detectable taste
receptors insects, and, many cases, taste receptors humans. And,
course, can high levels caffeine plant. plant also contains
compounds mask flavor caffeine, well then, plants going
essentially even stronger reinforcers flavor plant, OK? now
talking strong flavors plus strong neurostimulant effects caffeine.
important point effects caffeine subconscious. not
bee likes taste caffeine. fact, people, take
first sip coffee, find taste bitter kind noxious. don't like it.
may not even remember happened long ago caffeine
strong reinforcer quickly come like taste coffee. might
even come like feeling mug hand.

00:26:44 Caffeine Effects Brain; Reward Pathways



might even come like smell coffee forth.
caffeine stimulates release certain neurochemicals brain,
particular, dopamine acetylcholine, two neuromodulators increase focus
alertness feelings well-being. little bit later, tell caffeine
stimulates release dopamine way much distinct classical
dopamine pathway associated addiction reward. fact, can think
caffeine somewhat privileged access reward systems. give
bit hint going. Caffeine stimulates release dopamine
acetylcholine not within classic so-called mesolimbic reward pathway. just
fancy nerd speak reward pathways brain. associated things
like sex food drugs abuse, like cocaine methamphetamine. rather,
caffeine seems stimulate release dopamine parts brain
associated alertness cognition, meaning forebrain. important.
multiple dopamine systems brain body, caffeine seems
stimulate dopamine directly within components brain associated
clarity thought well-being, clarity thought. Now, also talking
caffeine strong reinforcer makes feel good overall. does.
suggests also taps classic reward pathway.
interesting frankly almost diabolical way. regularly ingest
caffeine, stimulates increase dopamine receptors multiple sites throughout
brain but, particular, within reward pathways brain. not areas
brain associated focus clarity thought cognition. that,
also increasing level dopamine receptors reward pathway.
means that, dopamine released response positive
experience, social experience, number things can stimulate
dopamine release, receptors, parking spots, will,
dopamine arrive exert increases mood, increases motivation,
overall feelings drive excitement. four ways caffeine works
need understand. First all, caffeine acts reinforcing agent. increases

00:29:55 Caffeine Reinforcing Agent

occurs awake hours throughout day. talk first
caffeine reinforcing agent. Again, first beautifully demonstrated
study honeybees bees prefer nectars contain caffeine.
makes perfect sense terms ecology bees flowers contain nectar.
advantage, least terms adaptation, flower benefits
distribution things flower, good flowers bees benefit,
getting food. kind symbiosis there.
humans, consuming caffeine-containing beverages sake. don't think
mind, bees mind, frankly, trying preserve
plants provide caffeine. think suffer, say 90% adults
suffer greatly caffeine-containing coffee tea plants gone,
certainly. us not consuming coffees teas caffeine-containing
foods thinking plants come want help
plants. thinking want help ourselves. yet point
reinforcing effects caffeine largely subconscious. not
aware them. Now might say, no, not true. drink caffeine, makes
feel really good. aware makes feel good. order illustrate
reinforcement really works, let give counter example,
aversive agent. reinforcing agents aversive agents. say
compounds nature exist plants aversive. indeed,
are. say compounds present low concentrations
couldn't taste them. say wake morning go
refrigerator open thirsty, reach nice rich red-
containing beverage glass jar. Maybe looks like cranberry juice something
sort. even nice clear glass water. looks like jug water glass
water, drink that. Taste fine you. Maybe even tastes great you.
say 30 minutes later, feel little queasy, feel little off, feel like


going back sleep, just don't feel good. don't know why, nervous
system predictive machine, process back integrates.
say integrates backwards immediate experience preceded not
good feeling. can reliably say much lower probability next
day wake reach beverage
container even. maybe novel environment, maybe staying
Airbnb hotel something sort, might even find don't really like
kitchen consume beverage first place. don't know
why. unless got very, sick day before, unlikely
strong response entirely avoid, instance, water glass jars
containing liquids, et cetera. say went back refrigerator
consume beverage just didn't feel well, felt less good
normally would. Well, even without ability taste beverage even
without understanding happening conscious level,
very, high probability will avoid drinking particular beverage
certainly location volume subsequent days. just
way aversive agents work. work way activating neurons gut
communicate areas brain give us feeling queasiness.
hearing this, pathway association times felt
queasy wanted vomit powerful might even feeling
symptomology now. certain people going increased salivation
precedes vomiting, know class neurons brain relate
area called area postrema actually stimulates vomiting. keep talking
this, probably feel like want vomit, going move
moment. ingest caffeine-containing beverages foods, exact
opposite scenario just described. Caffeine, reinforcer, makes us feel
slightly better lot better immediate minutes hours ingest it.
acting reinforcing agent not just effects caffeine
things preceded ingestion caffeine, return
caffeine-containing beverages, coffee tea maybe even foods
contain caffeine, even taste foods not something
otherwise consider, especially delicious. fact, people take first
sip coffee tea caffeine-containing beverage, find bitter.
not taste caffeine. taste beverage


independent caffeine. However, caffeine present there, come
prefer taste tastes. fact, will, mentioned earlier, will invest
lot financial resources time energy make sure get beverage.
trying make sure not get taste get
caffeine. positively reinforcing. taste therefore takes new
significance, new meaning, come associate positive. fact,
us, including myself, love taste espresso, love taste coffee, love taste
yerba maté even initial taste, first time consume beverage,
either neutral negative. reinforcing properties
caffeine. then, course, direct actions caffeine. is,
faster actions caffeine. just list off briefly
mind going forward, caffeine also increases release dopamine
acetylcholine, neuromodulators forebrain, increases clarity
thought ability rule switch, ability move one context another
change understand rules engagement, social engagement, physical
engagement, mental engagement, forth. mentioned before, caffeine also
increases number dopamine receptors reward pathway, good
thing happens you. positive experience will potent
effect feelings well-being. last certainly not least, caffeine acts

briefly talk adenosine molecular features. again, don't
background biology, don't worry. promise make clear everyone.
First all, caffeine called methylxantine. plant alkaloid.
caffeine bitter. Again, give just tiniest little bit pure
caffeine, find extremely aversive. plants snuck
small enough amounts caffeine masked flavor caffeine
flavors bees humans want consume them, don't
know plants think, seem diabolical clever
seeking caffeine-containing plants, beverages, foods even though caffeine
alkaloid very, bitter. Methylxantine-- caffeine-- binds
adenosine receptors. really two types adenosine receptors.
so-called A1 receptors A2 receptors. present different
parts brain body different levels. don't get far receptor
subtypes. importantly understand adenosine makes us feel tired
way taps ATP pathway. ATP pathway central energy
production feelings overall energy brain body cells organ
systems. caffeine binds adenosine receptors, prevents adenosine
breaking certain components energy production pathway. net
consequence increased cyclic AMP. basically, ingest caffeine,
biasing system towards pro-energetic aspects cellular pathways.
Now really important understand that, biology, even block receptor
prevent activity enzyme and-- least, case, end
cyclic AMP, energy. not really getting energy. actually


borrowing energy overall system frankly nonnegotiable.
mean that? Well, say wake six eight hours sleep
drink lot caffeine keep drinking caffeine throughout day blocking
adenosine receptors. Yes, offset fatigue. offset sleepiness
adenosine simply can't function. point caffeine becomes
dislodged adenosine receptors, will massive glut, backlog
adenosine, will feel extra, extra sleepy. really, no way create
energy system. Really, changing timing
sleepy signals energetic signals arriving. really
important understand backdrop various tools going get
next, can use caffeine enhancing mental performance physical
performance aspects health. important understand
concept that, wake morning provided slept well enough
night before, levels adenosine will low will ever be.
Actually, order get adenosine levels really bottomed out, want avoid
caffeine first 90 120 minutes waking. talk
turns way completely clear adenosine system hour
waking. people, adenosine levels going close
lowest good night's sleep. really no negotiating accumulation
adenosine going occur going bias towards feeling sleepy
would. Otherwise, going occur throughout day. really no way
eliminate adenosine. can really block function. sort like
borrowing energy fatigue will inevitably feel. Now actually
important socioeconomical relevance. caffeine regularly consumed
human beings, really slaves light/dark cycle. especially true
presence artificial lighting. even advent artificial lighting,
humans largely constrained outside light/dark cycle. need active
day working day, need asleep night. Caffeine
allows us divorce circadian cycle. Circadian just means 24
hour. Caffeine allows us least somewhat way increasing alertness.
is, spiking alertness various times throughout day even night.
can shift workers, instance, can sleep day
drink strong cup coffee 8:00 PM work night. ability
completely transformed society. Now, course, healthiest schedule--


know certainty. healthiest schedule brain body going alert
daytime asleep night. no question that. Shift workers run
sorts health problems. thank shift workers important
work do. need you. Air traffic controllers, paramedics, firefighters, police
officers, et cetera. know serious health consequences, negative
health consequences, is, shift workers. people there, 95%
people follow typical schedule. awake day asleep night.
yet used advent caffeine-containing beverages that,
sleepy afternoon, either take nap battle sleepiness,
activity rhythms sleep rhythms governed circadian changes
availability sunlight slept. just didn't ability ingest
beverage increase levels alertness block adenosine.
important understand that, nowadays, certainly live time
use-- fact, 90% adults half adolescents teenagers use
caffeine way negotiate with, borrow natural pattern adenosine
making us sleepy. again, just offsetting effects sleepiness
adenosine causes. can't eliminate adenosine entirely. important point
adenosine pro-sleep molecule nonnegotiable aspect biology. fact,
nonnegotiable that, every 24 hours, going release adenosine,
going release adenosine direct proportion long awake.
longer awake, adenosine circulating system.
really handful ways completely clear adenosine. major one
get sleep. take short nap, which, course, sleep, shallow

say that, somebody likes wake intense exercise

personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take
week get there. get there, find quite easy maintain.
thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life

caffeine action-- wouldn't really say 25 milligrams, 25% caffeine
action will still present 8:00 PM night, pretty remarkable.
long arc caffeine effects, can impede sleep take caffeine
afternoon. again, somebody wakes really need caffeine
right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit
half hour later. will extend arc caffeine
effects don't need afternoon

take caffeine sixth day. Now, sure many saying,
ever want abstain caffeine five days order just get six-day


performance-enhancing effect? Well, couple reasons that.
Perhaps planning travel new time zone, want use caffeine
stimulant stay day new time zone. somewhat unusual
case. Others might interested pro-physical performance effects
caffeine. talk little bit. want get maximum
strength increase maximum endurance increase ingesting, case, 300
600 milligrams caffeine. Well, case, abstaining caffeine five days will
greatly exacerbate pro-performance effects caffeine take sixth
day, although admittedly, five days likely pretty painful regular
caffeine user. Another variation this, however, might amount
caffeine ingest daily basis go back regular level
caffeine intake day need caffeine really boost mood,

interesting study. title "Time course tolerance performance


effects caffeine." like study that, yes, say
abstaining caffeine returning caffeine intake can enhance physical
performance specific way, also says that, take caffeine regularly,
can still see physical performance-enhancing effects caffeine. Although
not quite robust abstained caffeine. design
study pretty straightforward. people either ingest 3 milligrams per kilogram
caffeine 20 consecutive days. Many people already that, realize,
people ensure that. others ingested
placebo 20 days, abstained caffeine without realizing it.
20 days either ingesting caffeine placebo, peak performance measured
terms aerobic output. prior measurement, caffeine, OK?
20 days caffeine 21st day caffeine physical task
21st day. 20 days abstinence caffeine. day 21, get
caffeine, get physical test. discovered
ingestion caffeine increased peak performance aerobic output dramatically
people abstained caffeine. people consumed caffeine
way day, still effective ingest caffeine day 21 not
effective abstained. fact, magnitude
call ergogenic effect, pro-performance-enhancing effect caffeine,
higher first day subsequent days allowed people
continue caffeine intake. takeaway study really straightforward.
want get maximum physical performance-enhancing effects caffeine,
abstain caffeine 20 days. day 21, going physical
thing, task, ingest caffeine 30 minutes hour
physical challenge. Now 20 days abstinence going rough lot people.
certainly don't want sign study. case, might want five

abstain 20 days order get pro-performance effects caffeine day 21.


five days abstinence prior even two days abstinence prior.
intolerable mind, me, just reduce caffeine intake
slightly even perhaps can tolerate week two weeks
maybe even three weeks preceding physical mental challenge. Now again,
sort implies going marathon, going

00:29:55 Caffeine Reinforcing Agent

occurs awake hours throughout day. talk first
caffeine reinforcing agent. Again, first beautifully demonstrated
study honeybees bees prefer nectars contain caffeine.
makes perfect sense terms ecology bees flowers contain nectar.
advantage, least terms adaptation, flower benefits
distribution things flower, good flowers bees benefit,
getting food. kind symbiosis there.
humans, consuming caffeine-containing beverages sake. don't think
mind, bees mind, frankly, trying preserve

suffer greatly caffeine-containing coffee tea plants gone,
certainly. us not consuming coffees teas caffeine-containing

plants. thinking want help ourselves. yet point
reinforcing effects caffeine largely subconscious. not
aware them. Now might say, no, not true. drink caffeine, makes
feel really good. aware makes feel good. order illustrate
reinforcement really works, let give counter example,
aversive agent. reinforcing agents aversive agents. say
compounds nature exist plants aversive. indeed,
are. say compounds present low concentrations
couldn't taste them. say wake morning go
refrigerator open thirsty, reach nice rich red-
containing beverage glass jar. Maybe looks like cranberry juice something
sort. even nice clear glass water. looks like jug water glass
water, drink that. Taste fine you. Maybe even tastes great you.
say 30 minutes later, feel little queasy, feel little off, feel like


going back sleep, just don't feel good. don't know why, nervous
system predictive machine, process back integrates.
say integrates backwards immediate experience preceded not
good feeling. can reliably say much lower probability next
day wake reach beverage

without understanding happening conscious level,
very, high probability will avoid drinking particular beverage
certainly location volume subsequent days. just
way aversive agents work. work way activating neurons gut

hearing this, pathway association times felt

briefly talk adenosine molecular features. again, don't
background biology, don't worry. promise make clear everyone.
First all, caffeine called methylxantine. plant alkaloid.
caffeine bitter. Again, give just tiniest little bit pure
caffeine, find extremely aversive. plants snuck
small enough amounts caffeine masked flavor caffeine
flavors bees humans want consume them, don't
know plants think, seem diabolical clever
seeking caffeine-containing plants, beverages, foods even though caffeine
alkaloid very, bitter. Methylxantine-- caffeine-- binds
adenosine receptors. really two types adenosine receptors.
so-called A1 receptors A2 receptors. present different
parts brain body different levels. don't get far receptor
subtypes. importantly understand adenosine makes us feel tired
way taps ATP pathway. ATP pathway central energy
production feelings overall energy brain body cells organ
systems. caffeine binds adenosine receptors, prevents adenosine
breaking certain components energy production pathway. net
consequence increased cyclic AMP. basically, ingest caffeine,
biasing system towards pro-energetic aspects cellular pathways.
Now really important understand that, biology, even block receptor
prevent activity enzyme and-- least, case, end
cyclic AMP, energy. not really getting energy. actually


borrowing energy overall system frankly nonnegotiable.
mean that? Well, say wake six eight hours sleep
drink lot caffeine keep drinking caffeine throughout day blocking
adenosine receptors. Yes, offset fatigue. offset sleepiness
adenosine simply can't function. point caffeine becomes
dislodged adenosine receptors, will massive glut, backlog
adenosine, will feel extra, extra sleepy. really, no way create
energy system. Really, changing timing
sleepy signals energetic signals arriving. really
important understand backdrop various tools going get
next, can use caffeine enhancing mental performance physical

concept that, wake morning provided slept well enough

Actually, order get adenosine levels really bottomed out, want avoid

adenosine going occur going bias towards feeling sleepy
would. Otherwise, going occur throughout day. really no way
eliminate adenosine. can really block function. sort like
borrowing energy fatigue will inevitably feel. Now actually
important socioeconomical relevance. caffeine regularly consumed
human beings, really slaves light/dark cycle. especially true
presence artificial lighting. even advent artificial lighting,
humans largely constrained outside light/dark cycle. need active
day working day, need asleep night. Caffeine
allows us divorce circadian cycle. Circadian just means 24
hour. Caffeine allows us least somewhat way increasing alertness.

00:53:44 Tool: Delayed Caffeine Intake, Afternoon Crash & Sleep



might already ingesting. first tool like talk one
mentioned podcast several times. something haven't
heard will useful you. heard tool before, going
add additional features description tool make
worthwhile well. delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes
waking days. clear days might want
ingest caffeine closely wake up. want delay
caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking? answer simple.
Many people wake morning. drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes
within 2 minutes waking. feel alert naturally. makes sense
effects caffeine blocking effects adenosine talked
earlier effects neurotransmitter systems. find that,
early afternoon, particular, lunch, experience dramatic dip
overall levels energy, so-called afternoon crash. cases, way
respond ingest caffeine, indeed can increase levels
mood alertness. However, soon talk about, problem ingesting
caffeine afternoon falls within 8 10 dare even say 12 hours going
sleep. is, caffeine ingested afternoon-- everybody, say
95-plus percent people-- disrupts architecture quality nighttime
sleep. say doesn't necessarily impact ability fall asleep
maybe even sleep night depth quality sleep
disrupted consuming caffeine afternoon. little bit later, talk
can offset negative effects absolutely require caffeine
afternoon. huge advantage restricting caffeine intake early
part day not consuming caffeine within first 90 120 minutes
waking. fact, many people find delay caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking feel alert morning, completely
avoid afternoon crash. Now said, many people, including myself, need
short nap non-sleep deep rest form relaxation 10 30 minutes
afternoon. natural healthy. not referring need refer
so-called afternoon crash. talking afternoon crash
inability recover energy focus need consume caffeine just make
afternoon. delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking,
couple things accomplished. First all, offset afternoon


crash. effect many people experience first time start
delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. reason
works well following. mentioned earlier, adenosine molecule builds
longer awake. molecule reduced cleared
system sleep. emerge sleep regardless long slept,
adenosine levels lower went sleep previous night.
slept well enough long enough, adenosine levels can very, low,
never completely zero. wake morning, even
one people springs bed ready attack day--
certainly not describing myself. not one people. tend wake fairly slowly.
one spring attack day one people
moves slowly day, regardless, still residual adenosine
system. particularly case not get enough sleep enough
depth sleep night before. correct ratio slow-wave sleep rapid eye
movement sleep. interested optimizing sleep, just refer
master sleep episode Huberman Lab podcast, perfect sleep
episode Huberman Lab podcast. tool kit sleep
available, zero cost, time-stamped, et cetera hubermanlab.com. wake
morning. adenosine levels low, not zero. didn't sleep
well deeply enough night before, going adenosine
system. might think logical thing therefore drink caffeine block
adenosine there. happens accumulation,
sort glut adenosine hangs around. afternoon, effects
caffeine start wear off, will experience so-called afternoon crash.
mentioned earlier, way clear adenosine present
wake morning clear essentially completely without just blocking
receptors letting accumulate hang around. way
deliberately spike cortisol. Now, many heard cortisol, so-called
stress hormone, bad thing. indeed, chronically elevated cortisol bad thing.
depletes immune system. bad psychosocial effects. tends make us
feel anxious on. cortisol not bad. Cortisol wonderful. Cortisol
enhances efficiency immune system. makes us alert focused.
stimulates metabolism. huge number positive things, provided
released circadian fashion. is, appropriate times every 24 hours


tends peak close waking. fact, one reasons wake
morning, assuming weren't woken noise sleeping
environment warm, et cetera, cortisol levels start rise.
shortly waking, cortisol levels will start reach peak. refer
cortisol pulse, just biology nerd speak rise peak cortisol. want
cortisol pulse occur early day close waking, want
couple reasons. First all, don't restrict cortisol pulse early day,
will tend bleed later parts day. actually, late shifted cortisol peak
one hallmark signatures depression, low-level depression, serious
depression. can start disrupt sleep certainly can disrupt mood metabolism
immune system. want cortisol peak early day.
ensure happens? Well, wake morning. whether not
bounce-out-of-bed type groggy, kind wade slowly day
type like am, wake up, don't ingest caffeine. Fine and, fact, beneficial
hydrate water electrolytes. Terrific. fact, say necessary get bright
light eyes ideally sunlight. talked many, many times
podcast. wake sun comes out, turn bright artificial lights.
certainly sun even cloudy days, fact, especially
cloudy days, get outside anywhere 5 20, maybe even 30 minutes.
work outside, take breakfast outside breakfast eater. Get something done
outside even just get outside get bright light eyes. Why? Well,
shown studies humans getting bright light eyes
first hour waking soon possible waking increases peak
cortisol pulse 50%, 5-0. cortisol pulse, yes, increases mood, yes, increases
alertness, one important thing, that, indirect
pathway, can clear residual adenosine might present system
wake morning. Again, going especially important
not getting much sleep much quality sleep
like. going important get morning bright light ideally
sunlight, get cortisol peak going. ways increase cortisol peak
physical activity. don't time full workout, well then, getting
movement-- 10 minutes skipping rope even 5 minutes skipping rope
jumping jacks walking time ideally getting sunlight
eyes. going zero adenosine present system. If,


however, wake immediately drink caffeine-- caffeine can
stimulate release cortisol little bit otherwise present
system. blocking adenosine receptors indirect
effects caffeine cortisol system, actually reducing clearance
adenosine otherwise occur. realize mouthful. Just
clear, wake ingest caffeine right away, blocking adenosine
receptor, not clearing out. also preventing cortisol
normal increase rise can directly clear adenosine cortisol
can clear adenosine. want. want maximum
alertness focus morning throughout day. delaying
caffeine 90 120 minutes waking, set system get
morning cortisol peak. Ideally, peak even greater getting
bright light viewing. ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes
waking, not will craving just little bit, will drinking caffeine
already existing backdrop increased alertness two reasons. One
adenosine zeroed out, cortisol peak higher. now ingest
caffeine, can actually ingest levels caffeine little reasonable
almost certainty going fall 1 3 milligrams per kilogram dosage
will allow feel really alert will carry alertness well afternoon hours
without need drink caffeine thereby will prevent drinking
caffeine disrupting nighttime sleep. And, course, getting better nighttime
sleep, going zero adenosine even more. describing
essentially two tools. telling get morning sunlight maybe
exercise conjunction even brief exercise. main tool delaying
caffeine 90 120 minutes waking immediate effects, also sets motion
cascade domino

01:04:46 Morning Exercise & Residual Caffeine Effects

falls lead better sleep wakefulness next night next day
forth. Now realize people just simply cannot will
not delay caffeine 90 120 minutes waking whatever reason. First off, let
say that, somebody likes wake intense exercise
within first 90 minutes waking, well, case, appropriate


ingest caffeine just prior exercise. Not problem. Not problem.
expect combination drinking caffeine shortly waking plus
exercising intensely shortly waking will increase intensity early
afternoon afternoon fatigue feel. Now people, great thing.
can afford take nap non-sleep deep rest, step away work,
forth. case, strongly encourage whatever allows get
regular exercise regular exercise going beneficial. fact,
entire episode called tool kit fitness describes couple different really
one main structure allows get appropriate amount resistance training
cardiovascular training flexibility training throughout week. happen follow
program, works well. involve workouts
come early morning shortly waking. cases, ingest
caffeine just prior those, within 10, 20 minutes waking. However, days,
personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take
week get there. get there, find quite easy maintain.
thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life
12 hours. means ingest cup coffee say 8:00
AM-- say 100 milligram coffee just sake simplicity, 25%
caffeine action-- wouldn't really say 25 milligrams, 25% caffeine
action will still present 8:00 PM night, pretty remarkable.
long arc caffeine effects, can impede sleep take caffeine
afternoon. again, somebody wakes really need caffeine
right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit
half hour later. will extend arc caffeine
effects don't need afternoon



01:07:56 Tool: Theanine & Jitteriness; Fasting, Intermittent Caffeine Use

won't experience afternoon crash. way caffeine works,
mention that, ingest caffeine empty stomach, will
potent stimulant effect. will also tend increase level jitteriness caffeine
can produce. Later, talk ways offset jitteriness, just tell one
tool now. Many people opt take 100 milligrams theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine, way offset jitteriness. Theanine will reduce jitteriness
caffeine, many energy drink manufacturers even coffee
manufacturers now putting theanine energy drinks ground coffee because,
no surprise, allows people consume beverage thereby purchase
beverage, vendors want without feeling overly anxious
jittery. can take pill form theanine want caffeine. don't tend
that. Rather, control total dosage caffeine. tend consume
caffeine empty stomach restrict caffeine intake early part
day. generally eat first meal somewhere around 11:00 AM,
generally last meal time around 8:00 PM so. averages.
say plus minus hour. not religiously following kind
time-restricted feeding. just tends work best schedule
appetite. again, general theme. days wake
hungry, might ingest something, small snack something. meeting
somebody breakfast, sometimes breakfast. Sometimes won't.
forth. point can get away drinking less caffeine get
stimulant effect empty stomach. somebody likes
exercise empty stomach-- one people-- well then, ingesting
caffeine just prior exercise can fantastic tool. little bit later, talk
physical performance-enhancing effects caffeine. just briefly jump
point relate morning exercise. somebody
regularly ingests caffeine-- can define regularly by, ingested caffeine
every day last two weeks, regular consumer caffeine. Whereas
somebody ingests caffeine somewhere two four times per
week, well then, not regular consumer caffeine. intermittent user
caffeine. Well, somebody regular user caffeine, performance-


enhancing effects caffeine going dramatic take two three days
off drinking caffeine, mind a-- don't want call caffeine
addict regular caffeine user. horrible notion me, aversive notion,
like effects caffeine much. really want see
maximum performance-enhancing effects caffeine, will either one two
things. will either abstain caffeine days three days prior
ingesting caffeine, will use caffeine empty stomach. clear
caffeine empty stomach enhances mental physical enhancing effects
caffeine. And, course, stated backdrop consideration
very, hungry, can make hard concentrate
forth. not encouraging people starve means. Certainly, don't
that. want maximize performance-enhancing effects caffeine,
will consume empty stomach. final point that, caffeine
diuretic. causes us lose fluid and, along fluid, excrete sodium
effects caffeine various processes within kidney. one thing works
well maintain mood alertness longer given certain amount caffeine
intake avoid jitteriness can sometimes feel like crash low blood
sugar feeling even blurry vision make sure consume least equal

pinch salt sort electrolyte drink-- powder, rather. me, use element.
Full disclosure, podcast affiliate sponsor. don't need that.
simply just glass water alongside coffee espresso

will help offset jitteriness caffeine. lot people think that,
ingest caffeine, get jitteriness crash blood sugar
low. can case, oftentimes, simply excretion
sodium occurred ingested caffeine. encourage hydrate
well hydrate something contains little bit sodium. Obviously, not
much increases hypertension something sort small amount
sodium electrolyte drink like Element. electrolyte drinks
can accomplish same, course. Just couple quick notes

00:26:44 Caffeine Effects Brain; Reward Pathways



might even come like smell coffee forth.
caffeine stimulates release certain neurochemicals brain,
particular, dopamine acetylcholine, two neuromodulators increase focus
alertness feelings well-being. little bit later, tell caffeine
stimulates release dopamine way much distinct classical
dopamine pathway associated addiction reward. fact, can think
caffeine somewhat privileged access reward systems. give
bit hint going. Caffeine stimulates release dopamine
acetylcholine not within classic so-called mesolimbic reward pathway. just
fancy nerd speak reward pathways brain. associated things
like sex food drugs abuse, like cocaine methamphetamine. rather,
caffeine seems stimulate release dopamine parts brain
associated alertness cognition, meaning forebrain. important.
multiple dopamine systems brain body, caffeine seems
stimulate dopamine directly within components brain associated
clarity thought well-being, clarity thought. Now, also talking
caffeine strong reinforcer makes feel good overall. does.
suggests also taps classic reward pathway.
interesting frankly almost diabolical way. regularly ingest
caffeine, stimulates increase dopamine receptors multiple sites throughout
brain but, particular, within reward pathways brain. not areas
brain associated focus clarity thought cognition. that,
also increasing level dopamine receptors reward pathway.
means that, dopamine released response positive
experience, social experience, number things can stimulate
dopamine release, receptors, parking spots, will,
dopamine arrive exert increases mood, increases motivation,
overall feelings drive excitement. four ways caffeine works
need understand. First all, caffeine acts reinforcing agent. increases
probability will return engage certain activity consume certain
beverage food. Second all, caffeine increases dopamine acetylcholine,
neuromodulators forebrain, helps us improve ability think,
modify rule sets. is, adjust strategies different social situations

feel pretty good feel even better. fourth, caffeine acts antagonist
adenosine, offsets sleepiness otherwise feel

00:29:55 Caffeine Reinforcing Agent

occurs awake hours throughout day. talk first
caffeine reinforcing agent. Again, first beautifully demonstrated
study honeybees bees prefer nectars contain caffeine.
makes perfect sense terms ecology bees flowers contain nectar.
advantage, least terms adaptation, flower benefits
distribution things flower, good flowers bees benefit,
getting food. kind symbiosis there.
humans, consuming caffeine-containing beverages sake. don't think
mind, bees mind, frankly, trying preserve
plants provide caffeine. think suffer, say 90% adults
suffer greatly caffeine-containing coffee tea plants gone,
certainly. us not consuming coffees teas caffeine-containing
foods thinking plants come want help
plants. thinking want help ourselves. yet point
reinforcing effects caffeine largely subconscious. not
aware them. Now might say, no, not true. drink caffeine, makes
feel really good. aware makes feel good. order illustrate
reinforcement really works, let give counter example,
aversive agent. reinforcing agents aversive agents. say
compounds nature exist plants aversive. indeed,
are. say compounds present low concentrations
couldn't taste them. say wake morning go
refrigerator open thirsty, reach nice rich red-
containing beverage glass jar. Maybe looks like cranberry juice something
sort. even nice clear glass water. looks like jug water glass
water, drink that. Taste fine you. Maybe even tastes great you.
say 30 minutes later, feel little queasy, feel little off, feel like


going back sleep, just don't feel good. don't know why, nervous
system predictive machine, process back integrates.
say integrates backwards immediate experience preceded not
good feeling. can reliably say much lower probability next
day wake reach beverage
container even. maybe novel environment, maybe staying
Airbnb hotel something sort, might even find don't really like
kitchen consume beverage first place. don't know
why. unless got very, sick day before, unlikely
strong response entirely avoid, instance, water glass jars
containing liquids, et cetera. say went back refrigerator
consume beverage just didn't feel well, felt less good
normally would. Well, even without ability taste beverage even
without understanding happening conscious level,
very, high probability will avoid drinking particular beverage
certainly location volume subsequent days. just
way aversive agents work. work way activating neurons gut
communicate areas brain give us feeling queasiness.
hearing this, pathway association times felt
queasy wanted vomit powerful might even feeling
symptomology now. certain people going increased salivation
precedes vomiting, know class neurons brain relate
area called area postrema actually stimulates vomiting. keep talking
this, probably feel like want vomit, going move
moment. ingest caffeine-containing beverages foods, exact
opposite scenario just described. Caffeine, reinforcer, makes us feel
slightly better lot better immediate minutes hours ingest it.
acting reinforcing agent not just effects caffeine
things preceded ingestion caffeine, return
caffeine-containing beverages, coffee tea maybe even foods
contain caffeine, even taste foods not something
otherwise consider, especially delicious. fact, people take first
sip coffee tea caffeine-containing beverage, find bitter.
not taste caffeine. taste beverage


independent caffeine. However, caffeine present there, come
prefer taste tastes. fact, will, mentioned earlier, will invest
lot financial resources time energy make sure get beverage.
trying make sure not get taste get
caffeine. positively reinforcing. taste therefore takes new
significance, new meaning, come associate positive. fact,
us, including myself, love taste espresso, love taste coffee, love taste
yerba maté even initial taste, first time consume beverage,
either neutral negative. reinforcing properties
caffeine. then, course, direct actions caffeine. is,
faster actions caffeine. just list off briefly
mind going forward, caffeine also increases release dopamine
acetylcholine, neuromodulators forebrain, increases clarity
thought ability rule switch, ability move one context another
change understand rules engagement, social engagement, physical
engagement, mental engagement, forth. mentioned before, caffeine also
increases number dopamine receptors reward pathway, good
thing happens you. positive experience will potent

briefly talk adenosine molecular features. again, don't
background biology, don't worry. promise make clear everyone.
First all, caffeine called methylxantine. plant alkaloid.
caffeine bitter. Again, give just tiniest little bit pure
caffeine, find extremely aversive. plants snuck
small enough amounts caffeine masked flavor caffeine
flavors bees humans want consume them, don't
know plants think, seem diabolical clever
seeking caffeine-containing plants, beverages, foods even though caffeine
alkaloid very, bitter. Methylxantine-- caffeine-- binds
adenosine receptors. really two types adenosine receptors.
so-called A1 receptors A2 receptors. present different
parts brain body different levels. don't get far receptor
subtypes. importantly understand adenosine makes us feel tired
way taps ATP pathway. ATP pathway central energy
production feelings overall energy brain body cells organ
systems. caffeine binds adenosine receptors, prevents adenosine
breaking certain components energy production pathway. net
consequence increased cyclic AMP. basically, ingest caffeine,
biasing system towards pro-energetic aspects cellular pathways.
Now really important understand that, biology, even block receptor
prevent activity enzyme and-- least, case, end
cyclic AMP, energy. not really getting energy. actually


borrowing energy overall system frankly nonnegotiable.
mean that? Well, say wake six eight hours sleep
drink lot caffeine keep drinking caffeine throughout day blocking
adenosine receptors. Yes, offset fatigue. offset sleepiness
adenosine simply can't function. point caffeine becomes
dislodged adenosine receptors, will massive glut, backlog
adenosine, will feel extra, extra sleepy. really, no way create
energy system. Really, changing timing
sleepy signals energetic signals arriving. really
important understand backdrop various tools going get
next, can use caffeine enhancing mental performance physical
performance aspects health. important understand
concept that, wake morning provided slept well enough
night before, levels adenosine will low will ever be.
Actually, order get adenosine levels really bottomed out, want avoid
caffeine first 90 120 minutes waking. talk
turns way completely clear adenosine system hour
waking. people, adenosine levels going close
lowest good night's sleep. really no negotiating accumulation
adenosine going occur going bias towards feeling sleepy
would. Otherwise, going occur throughout day. really no way
eliminate adenosine. can really block function. sort like
borrowing energy fatigue will inevitably feel. Now actually
important socioeconomical relevance. caffeine regularly consumed
human beings, really slaves light/dark cycle. especially true
presence artificial lighting. even advent artificial lighting,
humans largely constrained outside light/dark cycle. need active
day working day, need asleep night. Caffeine
allows us divorce circadian cycle. Circadian just means 24
hour. Caffeine allows us least somewhat way increasing alertness.
is, spiking alertness various times throughout day even night.

health consequences, is, shift workers. people there, 95%
people follow typical schedule. awake day asleep night.
yet used advent caffeine-containing beverages that,
sleepy afternoon, either take nap battle sleepiness,
activity rhythms sleep rhythms governed circadian changes
availability sunlight slept. just didn't ability ingest
beverage increase levels alertness block adenosine.
important understand that, nowadays, certainly live time
use-- fact, 90% adults half adolescents teenagers use
caffeine way negotiate with, borrow natural pattern adenosine
making us sleepy. again, just offsetting effects sleepiness
adenosine causes. can't eliminate adenosine entirely. important point
adenosine pro-sleep molecule nonnegotiable aspect biology. fact,
nonnegotiable that, every 24 hours, going release adenosine,
going release adenosine direct proportion long awake.
longer awake, adenosine circulating system.
really handful ways completely clear adenosine. major one
get sleep. take short nap, which, course, sleep, shallow
sleep. non-sleep deep rest, so-called NSDR, shown reduce levels

use caffeine tool. Now caffeine potent useful tool
enhancing mental health, physical health, performance. certain
considerations one keep mind, particular, dose. Now, first off, not everybody
will respond dose caffeine way, can reliably say
body weight good measure can estimate healthy, useful
dose caffeine be. people, ingesting 1 3 milligrams caffeine per
kilogram body weight going range caffeine can positive

skin turn otherwise positive experience caffeine aversive
one. aren't familiar thinking terms kilograms normally
think pounds, just quickly give general estimations that, instance, 100
kilograms equals 220 pounds. me, weigh 100 kilograms. means 1 3
milligrams-- again, milligrams, thousandth gram. 1 3 milligrams caffeine per
kilogram body weight mean me. safely ingest 100 300 milligrams
caffeine single dose, single drink, way consuming it, pill
form way consuming it. likely will tolerable
dose. However, not somebody accustomed drinking caffeine
regular basis, suggest start lower end 1 3 milligrams per kilogram
body weight range. instance, somebody weighs 50 kilograms,
approximately 110 pounds. pretty comfortable ingesting
somewhere 50 150 milligrams caffeine. recommend
people considering using caffeine tool already ingesting
caffeine, start think dosage caffeine ingesting plan
ingest timing ingest caffeine relative certain tasks throughout
day, waking, sleep. talk just moment.
first step figure much weigh kilograms go
number 1 3 milligrams caffeine per kilogram body weight. good
range might want explore use caffeine single application,
meaning single dose. Now, realize people drinking coffee
day long coffee morning afternoon.
referring ingestion caffeine single bout, right? 1 cup coffee 2
cups coffee, instance, achieve 100 300 milligram range
appropriate body weight. avoid confusion, talk dosage
caffeine, really talking not total amount caffeine ingested per


day. talking total amount caffeine ingested one sitting setting,
is. somebody drinking caffeine multiple times throughout day,
can imagine-- instance, say appropriate dose order get
enhancement mental performance physical performance 200 milligrams.
somebody work morning, want lift
morning able focus better. physical exercise
afternoon vice versa ingest 200 milligrams caffeine two separate
times per day separated four hours. Now don't separate them.
put two hours apart, instance. talk half-life caffeine
forth. Just keep mind that, ingesting 200 milligrams caffeine
appropriate dose based body weight ingesting
another 200 milligrams caffeine hour later, effectively ingesting
approximately 400 milligrams caffeine, going start exceeding dose
can normally tolerate without feeling anxious jittery. said,
range tolerance caffeine based two things. One preexisting
disposition whether not genetics nervous system backdrop
life, much stress experiencing tends make feel anxious
alert jittery ingest caffeine. so-called caffeine-
adapted are. often hear tolerance. Tolerance means something
specific. ability ingest something plateau no
increase actual reduction effectiveness thing. not
really talking tolerance caffeine. talking caffeine-

drink caffeine tends increase heart rate make feel alert
bit anxious, chances not caffeine-adapted, provided
amount caffeine within healthy range you, is, ranges talked
moment ago. However, somebody drinks caffeine actually feel
alert relaxed, chances caffeine-adapted. various times
today's episode, talk people caffeine-adapted people not
caffeine-adapted. talk use caffeine every day. know
habitual caffeine drinkers including myself, just simple mention probably
sounds aversive. actually great utility using caffeine every day
opposed every day. just keep mind people will drink caffeine not
get much lift all. people will drink caffeine, will feel


extremely anxious even dosages far lower 1 3 milligrams per kilogram
body weight range described moment ago. take account
individual differences. said, 1 3 milligrams caffeine per kilogram body weight
given sitting. morning coffee morning yerba maté tea good
range start. encourage go online look various
beverages foods might eating contain caffeine. instance,
people surprised discover coffee get
standard popular vendors there, small coffee medium coffee, instance,
can contain much 400 600 milligrams caffeine. large coffee
often sold commercial vendors can contain much 1 gram, 1,000
milligrams, caffeine. Now may adapted doesn't make

00:53:44 Tool: Delayed Caffeine Intake, Afternoon Crash & Sleep



might already ingesting. first tool like talk one
mentioned podcast several times. something haven't
heard will useful you. heard tool before, going
add additional features description tool make
worthwhile well. delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes
waking days. clear days might want
ingest caffeine closely wake up. want delay
caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking? answer simple.
Many people wake morning. drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes
within 2 minutes waking. feel alert naturally. makes sense
effects caffeine blocking effects adenosine talked
earlier effects neurotransmitter systems. find that,
early afternoon, particular, lunch, experience dramatic dip
overall levels energy, so-called afternoon crash. cases, way
respond ingest caffeine, indeed can increase levels
mood alertness. However, soon talk about, problem ingesting
caffeine afternoon falls within 8 10 dare even say 12 hours going
sleep. is, caffeine ingested afternoon-- everybody, say
95-plus percent people-- disrupts architecture quality nighttime
sleep. say doesn't necessarily impact ability fall asleep
maybe even sleep night depth quality sleep
disrupted consuming caffeine afternoon. little bit later, talk
can offset negative effects absolutely require caffeine
afternoon. huge advantage restricting caffeine intake early
part day not consuming caffeine within first 90 120 minutes
waking. fact, many people find delay caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking feel alert morning, completely
avoid afternoon crash. Now said, many people, including myself, need
short nap non-sleep deep rest form relaxation 10 30 minutes
afternoon. natural healthy. not referring need refer
so-called afternoon crash. talking afternoon crash
inability recover energy focus need consume caffeine just make
afternoon. delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking,
couple things accomplished. First all, offset afternoon


crash. effect many people experience first time start
delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. reason
works well following. mentioned earlier, adenosine molecule builds
longer awake. molecule reduced cleared
system sleep. emerge sleep regardless long slept,
adenosine levels lower went sleep previous night.
slept well enough long enough, adenosine levels can very, low,
never completely zero. wake morning, even
one people springs bed ready attack day--
certainly not describing myself. not one people. tend wake fairly slowly.
one spring attack day one people
moves slowly day, regardless, still residual adenosine
system. particularly case not get enough sleep enough
depth sleep night before. correct ratio slow-wave sleep rapid eye
movement sleep. interested optimizing sleep, just refer
master sleep episode Huberman Lab podcast, perfect sleep
episode Huberman Lab podcast. tool kit sleep
available, zero cost, time-stamped, et cetera hubermanlab.com. wake
morning. adenosine levels low, not zero. didn't sleep
well deeply enough night before, going adenosine
system. might think logical thing therefore drink caffeine block
adenosine there. happens accumulation,
sort glut adenosine hangs around. afternoon, effects
caffeine start wear off, will experience so-called afternoon crash.
mentioned earlier, way clear adenosine present
wake morning clear essentially completely without just blocking
receptors letting accumulate hang around. way
deliberately spike cortisol. Now, many heard cortisol, so-called
stress hormone, bad thing. indeed, chronically elevated cortisol bad thing.
depletes immune system. bad psychosocial effects. tends make us
feel anxious on. cortisol not bad. Cortisol wonderful. Cortisol
enhances efficiency immune system. makes us alert focused.
stimulates metabolism. huge number positive things, provided
released circadian fashion. is, appropriate times every 24 hours


tends peak close waking. fact, one reasons wake
morning, assuming weren't woken noise sleeping
environment warm, et cetera, cortisol levels start rise.
shortly waking, cortisol levels will start reach peak. refer
cortisol pulse, just biology nerd speak rise peak cortisol. want
cortisol pulse occur early day close waking, want
couple reasons. First all, don't restrict cortisol pulse early day,
will tend bleed later parts day. actually, late shifted cortisol peak
one hallmark signatures depression, low-level depression, serious
depression. can start disrupt sleep certainly can disrupt mood metabolism
immune system. want cortisol peak early day.
ensure happens? Well, wake morning. whether not
bounce-out-of-bed type groggy, kind wade slowly day
type like am, wake up, don't ingest caffeine. Fine and, fact, beneficial
hydrate water electrolytes. Terrific. fact, say necessary get bright
light eyes ideally sunlight. talked many, many times
podcast. wake sun comes out, turn bright artificial lights.
certainly sun even cloudy days, fact, especially
cloudy days, get outside anywhere 5 20, maybe even 30 minutes.
work outside, take breakfast outside breakfast eater. Get something done
outside even just get outside get bright light eyes. Why? Well,
shown studies humans getting bright light eyes
first hour waking soon possible waking increases peak
cortisol pulse 50%, 5-0. cortisol pulse, yes, increases mood, yes, increases
alertness, one important thing, that, indirect
pathway, can clear residual adenosine might present system
wake morning. Again, going especially important
not getting much sleep much quality sleep
like. going important get morning bright light ideally
sunlight, get cortisol peak going. ways increase cortisol peak
physical activity. don't time full workout, well then, getting
movement-- 10 minutes skipping rope even 5 minutes skipping rope
jumping jacks walking time ideally getting sunlight
eyes. going zero adenosine present system. If,


however, wake immediately drink caffeine-- caffeine can
stimulate release cortisol little bit otherwise present
system. blocking adenosine receptors indirect
effects caffeine cortisol system, actually reducing clearance
adenosine otherwise occur. realize mouthful. Just
clear, wake ingest caffeine right away, blocking adenosine
receptor, not clearing out. also preventing cortisol
normal increase rise can directly clear adenosine cortisol
can clear adenosine. want. want maximum
alertness focus morning throughout day. delaying
caffeine 90 120 minutes waking, set system get
morning cortisol peak. Ideally, peak even greater getting
bright light viewing. ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes
waking, not will craving just little bit, will drinking caffeine
already existing backdrop increased alertness two reasons. One
adenosine zeroed out, cortisol peak higher. now ingest
caffeine, can actually ingest levels caffeine little reasonable
almost certainty going fall 1 3 milligrams per kilogram dosage
will allow feel really alert will carry alertness well afternoon hours
without need drink caffeine thereby will prevent drinking
caffeine disrupting nighttime sleep. And, course, getting better nighttime
sleep, going zero adenosine even more. describing
essentially two tools. telling get morning sunlight maybe
exercise conjunction even brief exercise. main tool delaying
caffeine 90 120 minutes waking immediate effects, also sets motion
cascade domino

01:04:46 Morning Exercise & Residual Caffeine Effects

falls lead better sleep wakefulness next night next day
forth. Now realize people just simply cannot will
not delay caffeine 90 120 minutes waking whatever reason. First off, let
say that, somebody likes wake intense exercise
within first 90 minutes waking, well, case, appropriate


ingest caffeine just prior exercise. Not problem. Not problem.
expect combination drinking caffeine shortly waking plus
exercising intensely shortly waking will increase intensity early
afternoon afternoon fatigue feel. Now people, great thing.
can afford take nap non-sleep deep rest, step away work,
forth. case, strongly encourage whatever allows get
regular exercise regular exercise going beneficial. fact,
entire episode called tool kit fitness describes couple different really
one main structure allows get appropriate amount resistance training
cardiovascular training flexibility training throughout week. happen follow
program, works well. involve workouts
come early morning shortly waking. cases, ingest
caffeine just prior those, within 10, 20 minutes waking. However, days,
personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take
week get there. get there, find quite easy maintain.
thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life
12 hours. means ingest cup coffee say 8:00
AM-- say 100 milligram coffee just sake simplicity, 25%
caffeine action-- wouldn't really say 25 milligrams, 25% caffeine
action will still present 8:00 PM night, pretty remarkable.
long arc caffeine effects, can impede sleep take caffeine
afternoon. again, somebody wakes really need caffeine
right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit
half hour later. will extend arc caffeine
effects don't need afternoon



01:07:56 Tool: Theanine & Jitteriness; Fasting, Intermittent Caffeine Use

won't experience afternoon crash. way caffeine works,
mention that, ingest caffeine empty stomach, will
potent stimulant effect. will also tend increase level jitteriness caffeine
can produce. Later, talk ways offset jitteriness, just tell one
tool now. Many people opt take 100 milligrams theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine, way offset jitteriness. Theanine will reduce jitteriness
caffeine, many energy drink manufacturers even coffee
manufacturers now putting theanine energy drinks ground coffee because,
no surprise, allows people consume beverage thereby purchase
beverage, vendors want without feeling overly anxious
jittery. can take pill form theanine want caffeine. don't tend
that. Rather, control total dosage caffeine. tend consume
caffeine empty stomach restrict caffeine intake early part
day. generally eat first meal somewhere around 11:00 AM,
generally last meal time around 8:00 PM so. averages.
say plus minus hour. not religiously following kind
time-restricted feeding. just tends work best schedule
appetite. again, general theme. days wake
hungry, might ingest something, small snack something. meeting
somebody breakfast, sometimes breakfast. Sometimes won't.
forth. point can get away drinking less caffeine get
stimulant effect empty stomach. somebody likes

drinks music et cetera-- exercise mental work experience
matter OK every people, don't want get
habit consistently every time exercise every time go out,
instance. really want cautious. is, want protect
baseline levels dopamine peak levels dopamine. said, people
want experience increase mood, alertness, performance, want
condition themselves-- really is. conditioning
reinforcing effects dopamine increase liking maybe even loving
exercise. Occasionally, using caffeine frequently using caffeine prior exercise fine


careful. careful, mean pay attention
feel hours days dopamine increase wears off. instance,
ingest caffeine exercise intensely feeling great afterwards
eight hours later next day, feeling little bit low, suggest don't go
back exact thing right away. give little bit time
let baseline dopamine return normal. again, stacking different things,
chemical behavioral, order increase dopamine can done safe way
beneficial you, depending goals. careful not stacking many
stimuli

02:06:04 Scheduling Caffeine Maximize Effects

dopamine often. key. Early episode, mentioned one possible
caffeine-consuming schedule works well doesn't fortunately subject
long 20-day bouts 5-day even 2-day bouts abstinence. every
day schedule caffeine. look half-life caffeine look effects
dopamine system performance-enhancing effects period
abstinence can, fact, increase performance-enhancing effects caffeine--
also take consideration caffeine can habit-forming, can develop
sort tolerance caffeine. Well then, emerges
person consumes caffeine every day can actually help maximize
positive effects caffeine without subjecting kind misery occurs
accustomed consuming caffeine every single day suddenly go 2
5 20-day abstinence. never tried every day caffeine
approach, although considering based literature read.
considering specific way, consume caffeine

02:08:33 Pro-Health Effects Caffeine

seem rational scientifically grounded one order maximize
effects. addition so-called performance-enhancing effects caffeine,
also well studied now fairly well mechanistically understood pro-health
effects caffeine. Now, talk pro-health effects caffeine, want
clear that, schedule caffeine intake-- is, timing caffeine
intake anything else matter-- offsets getting regular high quality sleep
sufficient duration, well, undermining pro-health effects thing.

said, several well described health-promoting effects caffeine ingestion.
again, say caffeine ingestion, referring 1 3 milligrams per

00:26:44 Caffeine Effects Brain; Reward Pathways



might even come like smell coffee forth.
caffeine stimulates release certain neurochemicals brain,
particular, dopamine acetylcholine, two neuromodulators increase focus
alertness feelings well-being. little bit later, tell caffeine
stimulates release dopamine way much distinct classical
dopamine pathway associated addiction reward. fact, can think
caffeine somewhat privileged access reward systems. give
bit hint going. Caffeine stimulates release dopamine
acetylcholine not within classic so-called mesolimbic reward pathway. just
fancy nerd speak reward pathways brain. associated things
like sex food drugs abuse, like cocaine methamphetamine. rather,
caffeine seems stimulate release dopamine parts brain
associated alertness cognition, meaning forebrain. important.
multiple dopamine systems brain body, caffeine seems
stimulate dopamine directly within components brain associated
clarity thought well-being, clarity thought. Now, also talking
caffeine strong reinforcer makes feel good overall. does.
suggests also taps classic reward pathway.
interesting frankly almost diabolical way. regularly ingest
caffeine, stimulates increase dopamine receptors multiple sites throughout
brain but, particular, within reward pathways brain. not areas
brain associated focus clarity thought cognition. that,
also increasing level dopamine receptors reward pathway.
means that, dopamine released response positive
experience, social experience, number things can stimulate
dopamine release, receptors, parking spots, will,
dopamine arrive exert increases mood, increases motivation,
overall feelings drive excitement. four ways caffeine works
need understand. First all, caffeine acts reinforcing agent. increases
probability will return engage certain activity consume certain
beverage food. Second all, caffeine increases dopamine acetylcholine,
neuromodulators forebrain, helps us improve ability think,
modify rule sets. is, adjust strategies different social situations

feel pretty good feel even better. fourth, caffeine acts antagonist
adenosine, offsets sleepiness otherwise feel
accumulation adenosine

00:29:55 Caffeine Reinforcing Agent

occurs awake hours throughout day. talk first
caffeine reinforcing agent. Again, first beautifully demonstrated
study honeybees bees prefer nectars contain caffeine.
makes perfect sense terms ecology bees flowers contain nectar.
advantage, least terms adaptation, flower benefits
distribution things flower, good flowers bees benefit,
getting food. kind symbiosis there.
humans, consuming caffeine-containing beverages sake. don't think
mind, bees mind, frankly, trying preserve
plants provide caffeine. think suffer, say 90% adults
suffer greatly caffeine-containing coffee tea plants gone,
certainly. us not consuming coffees teas caffeine-containing
foods thinking plants come want help
plants. thinking want help ourselves. yet point
reinforcing effects caffeine largely subconscious. not
aware them. Now might say, no, not true. drink caffeine, makes
feel really good. aware makes feel good. order illustrate
reinforcement really works, let give counter example,
aversive agent. reinforcing agents aversive agents. say
compounds nature exist plants aversive. indeed,
are. say compounds present low concentrations
couldn't taste them. say wake morning go
refrigerator open thirsty, reach nice rich red-
containing beverage glass jar. Maybe looks like cranberry juice something
sort. even nice clear glass water. looks like jug water glass
water, drink that. Taste fine you. Maybe even tastes great you.
say 30 minutes later, feel little queasy, feel little off, feel like


going back sleep, just don't feel good. don't know why, nervous
system predictive machine, process back integrates.
say integrates backwards immediate experience preceded not
good feeling. can reliably say much lower probability next
day wake reach beverage
container even. maybe novel environment, maybe staying
Airbnb hotel something sort, might even find don't really like
kitchen consume beverage first place. don't know
why. unless got very, sick day before, unlikely
strong response entirely avoid, instance, water glass jars
containing liquids, et cetera. say went back refrigerator
consume beverage just didn't feel well, felt less good
normally would. Well, even without ability taste beverage even
without understanding happening conscious level,
very, high probability will avoid drinking particular beverage
certainly location volume subsequent days. just
way aversive agents work. work way activating neurons gut
communicate areas brain give us feeling queasiness.
hearing this, pathway association times felt
queasy wanted vomit powerful might even feeling
symptomology now. certain people going increased salivation
precedes vomiting, know class neurons brain relate
area called area postrema actually stimulates vomiting. keep talking
this, probably feel like want vomit, going move
moment. ingest caffeine-containing beverages foods, exact
opposite scenario just described. Caffeine, reinforcer, makes us feel
slightly better lot better immediate minutes hours ingest it.
acting reinforcing agent not just effects caffeine
things preceded ingestion caffeine, return
caffeine-containing beverages, coffee tea maybe even foods
contain caffeine, even taste foods not something
otherwise consider, especially delicious. fact, people take first
sip coffee tea caffeine-containing beverage, find bitter.
not taste caffeine. taste beverage


independent caffeine. However, caffeine present there, come
prefer taste tastes. fact, will, mentioned earlier, will invest
lot financial resources time energy make sure get beverage.
trying make sure not get taste get
caffeine. positively reinforcing. taste therefore takes new
significance, new meaning, come associate positive. fact,
us, including myself, love taste espresso, love taste coffee, love taste
yerba maté even initial taste, first time consume beverage,
either neutral negative. reinforcing properties
caffeine. then, course, direct actions caffeine. is,
faster actions caffeine. just list off briefly
mind going forward, caffeine also increases release dopamine
acetylcholine, neuromodulators forebrain, increases clarity
thought ability rule switch, ability move one context another
change understand rules engagement, social engagement, physical
engagement, mental engagement, forth. mentioned before, caffeine also
increases number dopamine receptors reward pathway, good
thing happens you. positive experience will potent
effect feelings well-being. last certainly not least, caffeine acts

briefly talk adenosine molecular features. again, don't
background biology, don't worry. promise make clear everyone.
First all, caffeine called methylxantine. plant alkaloid.
caffeine bitter. Again, give just tiniest little bit pure
caffeine, find extremely aversive. plants snuck
small enough amounts caffeine masked flavor caffeine
flavors bees humans want consume them, don't
know plants think, seem diabolical clever
seeking caffeine-containing plants, beverages, foods even though caffeine
alkaloid very, bitter. Methylxantine-- caffeine-- binds
adenosine receptors. really two types adenosine receptors.
so-called A1 receptors A2 receptors. present different
parts brain body different levels. don't get far receptor
subtypes. importantly understand adenosine makes us feel tired
way taps ATP pathway. ATP pathway central energy
production feelings overall energy brain body cells organ
systems. caffeine binds adenosine receptors, prevents adenosine
breaking certain components energy production pathway. net
consequence increased cyclic AMP. basically, ingest caffeine,
biasing system towards pro-energetic aspects cellular pathways.
Now really important understand that, biology, even block receptor
prevent activity enzyme and-- least, case, end
cyclic AMP, energy. not really getting energy. actually


borrowing energy overall system frankly nonnegotiable.
mean that? Well, say wake six eight hours sleep
drink lot caffeine keep drinking caffeine throughout day blocking
adenosine receptors. Yes, offset fatigue. offset sleepiness
adenosine simply can't function. point caffeine becomes
dislodged adenosine receptors, will massive glut, backlog
adenosine, will feel extra, extra sleepy. really, no way create
energy system. Really, changing timing
sleepy signals energetic signals arriving. really
important understand backdrop various tools going get
next, can use caffeine enhancing mental performance physical
performance aspects health. important understand
concept that, wake morning provided slept well enough
night before, levels adenosine will low will ever be.
Actually, order get adenosine levels really bottomed out, want avoid
caffeine first 90 120 minutes waking. talk
turns way completely clear adenosine system hour
waking. people, adenosine levels going close
lowest good night's sleep. really no negotiating accumulation
adenosine going occur going bias towards feeling sleepy
would. Otherwise, going occur throughout day. really no way
eliminate adenosine. can really block function. sort like
borrowing energy fatigue will inevitably feel. Now actually
important socioeconomical relevance. caffeine regularly consumed
human beings, really slaves light/dark cycle. especially true
presence artificial lighting. even advent artificial lighting,
humans largely constrained outside light/dark cycle. need active
day working day, need asleep night. Caffeine
allows us divorce circadian cycle. Circadian just means 24
hour. Caffeine allows us least somewhat way increasing alertness.
is, spiking alertness various times throughout day even night.
can shift workers, instance, can sleep day
drink strong cup coffee 8:00 PM work night. ability
completely transformed society. Now, course, healthiest schedule--


know certainty. healthiest schedule brain body going alert

health consequences, is, shift workers. people there, 95%
people follow typical schedule. awake day asleep night.
yet used advent caffeine-containing beverages that,
sleepy afternoon, either take nap battle sleepiness,
activity rhythms sleep rhythms governed circadian changes
availability sunlight slept. just didn't ability ingest
beverage increase levels alertness block adenosine.
important understand that, nowadays, certainly live time
use-- fact, 90% adults half adolescents teenagers use
caffeine way negotiate with, borrow natural pattern adenosine
making us sleepy. again, just offsetting effects sleepiness
adenosine causes. can't eliminate adenosine entirely. important point
adenosine pro-sleep molecule nonnegotiable aspect biology. fact,
nonnegotiable that, every 24 hours, going release adenosine,
going release adenosine direct proportion long awake.
longer awake, adenosine circulating system.
really handful ways completely clear adenosine. major one
get sleep. take short nap, which, course, sleep, shallow

enhancing mental health, physical health, performance. certain
considerations one keep mind, particular, dose. Now, first off, not everybody
will respond dose caffeine way, can reliably say

one. aren't familiar thinking terms kilograms normally
think pounds, just quickly give general estimations that, instance, 100
kilograms equals 220 pounds. me, weigh 100 kilograms. means 1 3
milligrams-- again, milligrams, thousandth gram. 1 3 milligrams caffeine per
kilogram body weight mean me. safely ingest 100 300 milligrams
caffeine single dose, single drink, way consuming it, pill
form way consuming it. likely will tolerable
dose. However, not somebody accustomed drinking caffeine
regular basis, suggest start lower end 1 3 milligrams per kilogram
body weight range. instance, somebody weighs 50 kilograms,
approximately 110 pounds. pretty comfortable ingesting
somewhere 50 150 milligrams caffeine. recommend
people considering using caffeine tool already ingesting
caffeine, start think dosage caffeine ingesting plan
ingest timing ingest caffeine relative certain tasks throughout
day, waking, sleep. talk just moment.
first step figure much weigh kilograms go

range might want explore use caffeine single application,
meaning single dose. Now, realize people drinking coffee
day long coffee morning afternoon.
referring ingestion caffeine single bout, right? 1 cup coffee 2
cups coffee, instance, achieve 100 300 milligram range
appropriate body weight. avoid confusion, talk dosage
caffeine, really talking not total amount caffeine ingested per


day. talking total amount caffeine ingested one sitting setting,
is. somebody drinking caffeine multiple times throughout day,
can imagine-- instance, say appropriate dose order get

somebody work morning, want lift
morning able focus better. physical exercise
afternoon vice versa ingest 200 milligrams caffeine two separate

00:53:44 Tool: Delayed Caffeine Intake, Afternoon Crash & Sleep



might already ingesting. first tool like talk one
mentioned podcast several times. something haven't
heard will useful you. heard tool before, going
add additional features description tool make
worthwhile well. delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes
waking days. clear days might want
ingest caffeine closely wake up. want delay
caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking? answer simple.
Many people wake morning. drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes
within 2 minutes waking. feel alert naturally. makes sense
effects caffeine blocking effects adenosine talked
earlier effects neurotransmitter systems. find that,
early afternoon, particular, lunch, experience dramatic dip
overall levels energy, so-called afternoon crash. cases, way
respond ingest caffeine, indeed can increase levels
mood alertness. However, soon talk about, problem ingesting
caffeine afternoon falls within 8 10 dare even say 12 hours going
sleep. is, caffeine ingested afternoon-- everybody, say
95-plus percent people-- disrupts architecture quality nighttime
sleep. say doesn't necessarily impact ability fall asleep
maybe even sleep night depth quality sleep
disrupted consuming caffeine afternoon. little bit later, talk
can offset negative effects absolutely require caffeine
afternoon. huge advantage restricting caffeine intake early
part day not consuming caffeine within first 90 120 minutes
waking. fact, many people find delay caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking feel alert morning, completely
avoid afternoon crash. Now said, many people, including myself, need
short nap non-sleep deep rest form relaxation 10 30 minutes
afternoon. natural healthy. not referring need refer
so-called afternoon crash. talking afternoon crash
inability recover energy focus need consume caffeine just make
afternoon. delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking,
couple things accomplished. First all, offset afternoon


crash. effect many people experience first time start
delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. reason
works well following. mentioned earlier, adenosine molecule builds

reinforcing effects caffeine largely subconscious. not
aware them. Now might say, no, not true. drink caffeine, makes
feel really good. aware makes feel good. order illustrate
reinforcement really works, let give counter example,
aversive agent. reinforcing agents aversive agents. say
compounds nature exist plants aversive. indeed,
are. say compounds present low concentrations
couldn't taste them. say wake morning go
refrigerator open thirsty, reach nice rich red-
containing beverage glass jar. Maybe looks like cranberry juice something
sort. even nice clear glass water. looks like jug water glass
water, drink that. Taste fine you. Maybe even tastes great you.
say 30 minutes later, feel little queasy, feel little off, feel like


going back sleep, just don't feel good. don't know why, nervous
system predictive machine, process back integrates.
say integrates backwards immediate experience preceded not
good feeling. can reliably say much lower probability next
day wake reach beverage
container even. maybe novel environment, maybe staying
Airbnb hotel something sort, might even find don't really like
kitchen consume beverage first place. don't know
why. unless got very, sick day before, unlikely
strong response entirely avoid, instance, water glass jars
containing liquids, et cetera. say went back refrigerator
consume beverage just didn't feel well, felt less good
normally would. Well, even without ability taste beverage even
without understanding happening conscious level,
very, high probability will avoid drinking particular beverage
certainly location volume subsequent days. just
way aversive agents work. work way activating neurons gut
communicate areas brain give us feeling queasiness.
hearing this, pathway association times felt
queasy wanted vomit powerful might even feeling
symptomology now. certain people going increased salivation
precedes vomiting, know class neurons brain relate
area called area postrema actually stimulates vomiting. keep talking
this, probably feel like want vomit, going move

briefly talk adenosine molecular features. again, don't
background biology, don't worry. promise make clear everyone.
First all, caffeine called methylxantine. plant alkaloid.
caffeine bitter. Again, give just tiniest little bit pure
caffeine, find extremely aversive. plants snuck
small enough amounts caffeine masked flavor caffeine
flavors bees humans want consume them, don't
know plants think, seem diabolical clever
seeking caffeine-containing plants, beverages, foods even though caffeine
alkaloid very, bitter. Methylxantine-- caffeine-- binds
adenosine receptors. really two types adenosine receptors.
so-called A1 receptors A2 receptors. present different
parts brain body different levels. don't get far receptor
subtypes. importantly understand adenosine makes us feel tired
way taps ATP pathway. ATP pathway central energy
production feelings overall energy brain body cells organ
systems. caffeine binds adenosine receptors, prevents adenosine
breaking certain components energy production pathway. net
consequence increased cyclic AMP. basically, ingest caffeine,
biasing system towards pro-energetic aspects cellular pathways.
Now really important understand that, biology, even block receptor
prevent activity enzyme and-- least, case, end
cyclic AMP, energy. not really getting energy. actually


borrowing energy overall system frankly nonnegotiable.
mean that? Well, say wake six eight hours sleep
drink lot caffeine keep drinking caffeine throughout day blocking
adenosine receptors. Yes, offset fatigue. offset sleepiness
adenosine simply can't function. point caffeine becomes
dislodged adenosine receptors, will massive glut, backlog
adenosine, will feel extra, extra sleepy. really, no way create

important understand backdrop various tools going get
next, can use caffeine enhancing mental performance physical

borrowing energy fatigue will inevitably feel. Now actually
important socioeconomical relevance. caffeine regularly consumed
human beings, really slaves light/dark cycle. especially true
presence artificial lighting. even advent artificial lighting,
humans largely constrained outside light/dark cycle. need active
day working day, need asleep night. Caffeine
allows us divorce circadian cycle. Circadian just means 24
hour. Caffeine allows us least somewhat way increasing alertness.

personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take

thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life

right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit

01:56:34 Tool: Exercise, Caffeine, Dopamine & Positive Reinforcement

Put comment section would. appreciate that. another


important potent use caffeine enhancing performance. relates not just
dopamine epinephrine arousal-inducing effects caffeine.
doesn't even just relate effect caffeine enhancing frontal lobe function.
include that, also includes reinforcing effects caffeine
talked beginning episode. best way illustrate

highlighting here, also increases reinforcement pathways associated
exercise. is, creates positive feeling general theme engaging

think this, nothing else call support idea, ingesting caffeine
performance-enhancing tool makes perfect sense. don't
enjoy exercise, particular, certain forms exercise, ingesting caffeine can change

First all, caffeine called methylxantine. plant alkaloid.
caffeine bitter. Again, give just tiniest little bit pure
caffeine, find extremely aversive. plants snuck
small enough amounts caffeine masked flavor caffeine
flavors bees humans want consume them, don't
know plants think, seem diabolical clever
seeking caffeine-containing plants, beverages, foods even though caffeine
alkaloid very, bitter. Methylxantine-- caffeine-- binds
adenosine receptors. really two types adenosine receptors.
so-called A1 receptors A2 receptors. present different
parts brain body different levels. don't get far receptor
subtypes. importantly understand adenosine makes us feel tired
way taps ATP pathway. ATP pathway central energy
production feelings overall energy brain body cells organ

breaking certain components energy production pathway. net
consequence increased cyclic AMP. basically, ingest caffeine,
biasing system towards pro-energetic aspects cellular pathways.
Now really important understand that, biology, even block receptor
prevent activity enzyme and-- least, case, end
cyclic AMP, energy. not really getting energy. actually


borrowing energy overall system frankly nonnegotiable.
mean that? Well, say wake six eight hours sleep
drink lot caffeine keep drinking caffeine throughout day blocking
adenosine receptors. Yes, offset fatigue. offset sleepiness
adenosine simply can't function. point caffeine becomes

not delay caffeine 90 120 minutes waking whatever reason. First off, let
say that, somebody likes wake intense exercise

personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take
week get there. get there, find quite easy maintain.
thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life

long arc caffeine effects, can impede sleep take caffeine
afternoon. again, somebody wakes really need caffeine
right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit
half hour later. will extend arc caffeine

performance specific way, also says that, take caffeine regularly,
can still see physical performance-enhancing effects caffeine. Although
not quite robust abstained caffeine. design
study pretty straightforward. people either ingest 3 milligrams per kilogram
caffeine 20 consecutive days. Many people already that, realize,
people ensure that. others ingested
placebo 20 days, abstained caffeine without realizing it.
20 days either ingesting caffeine placebo, peak performance measured

01:56:34 Tool: Exercise, Caffeine, Dopamine & Positive Reinforcement

Put comment section would. appreciate that. another


important potent use caffeine enhancing performance. relates not just
dopamine epinephrine arousal-inducing effects caffeine.
doesn't even just relate effect caffeine enhancing frontal lobe function.
include that, also includes reinforcing effects caffeine
talked beginning episode. best way illustrate

highlighting here, also increases reinforcement pathways associated
exercise. is, creates positive feeling general theme engaging
exercise, creates general positive experience things follow exercise.
think this, nothing else call support idea, ingesting caffeine
performance-enhancing tool makes perfect sense. don't
enjoy exercise, particular, certain forms exercise, ingesting caffeine can change
relationship exercise. words, make positive, much
way ingesting caffeine alongside certain taste otherwise

contained episode dopamine, motivation, drive.
pointed that, somebody tends experience difficulty

briefly talk adenosine molecular features. again, don't
background biology, don't worry. promise make clear everyone.
First all, caffeine called methylxantine. plant alkaloid.
caffeine bitter. Again, give just tiniest little bit pure
caffeine, find extremely aversive. plants snuck
small enough amounts caffeine masked flavor caffeine
flavors bees humans want consume them, don't
know plants think, seem diabolical clever
seeking caffeine-containing plants, beverages, foods even though caffeine
alkaloid very, bitter. Methylxantine-- caffeine-- binds
adenosine receptors. really two types adenosine receptors.
so-called A1 receptors A2 receptors. present different
parts brain body different levels. don't get far receptor
subtypes. importantly understand adenosine makes us feel tired
way taps ATP pathway. ATP pathway central energy
production feelings overall energy brain body cells organ
systems. caffeine binds adenosine receptors, prevents adenosine
breaking certain components energy production pathway. net
consequence increased cyclic AMP. basically, ingest caffeine,
biasing system towards pro-energetic aspects cellular pathways.
Now really important understand that, biology, even block receptor
prevent activity enzyme and-- least, case, end
cyclic AMP, energy. not really getting energy. actually


borrowing energy overall system frankly nonnegotiable.
mean that? Well, say wake six eight hours sleep
drink lot caffeine keep drinking caffeine throughout day blocking
adenosine receptors. Yes, offset fatigue. offset sleepiness
adenosine simply can't function. point caffeine becomes

forth. Now realize people just simply cannot will
not delay caffeine 90 120 minutes waking whatever reason. First off, let
say that, somebody likes wake intense exercise
within first 90 minutes waking, well, case, appropriate


ingest caffeine just prior exercise. Not problem. Not problem.
expect combination drinking caffeine shortly waking plus
exercising intensely shortly waking will increase intensity early
afternoon afternoon fatigue feel. Now people, great thing.

come early morning shortly waking. cases, ingest
caffeine just prior those, within 10, 20 minutes waking. However, days,
personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take
week get there. get there, find quite easy maintain.
thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life
12 hours. means ingest cup coffee say 8:00
AM-- say 100 milligram coffee just sake simplicity, 25%
caffeine action-- wouldn't really say 25 milligrams, 25% caffeine
action will still present 8:00 PM night, pretty remarkable.
long arc caffeine effects, can impede sleep take caffeine
afternoon. again, somebody wakes really need caffeine
right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit
half hour later. will extend arc caffeine
effects don't need afternoon

tool now. Many people opt take 100 milligrams theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine, way offset jitteriness. Theanine will reduce jitteriness
caffeine, many energy drink manufacturers even coffee
manufacturers now putting theanine energy drinks ground coffee because,
no surprise, allows people consume beverage thereby purchase

abstaining caffeine returning caffeine intake can enhance physical

can still see physical performance-enhancing effects caffeine. Although
not quite robust abstained caffeine. design
study pretty straightforward. people either ingest 3 milligrams per kilogram
caffeine 20 consecutive days. Many people already that, realize,
people ensure that. others ingested

forth. Now realize people just simply cannot will
not delay caffeine 90 120 minutes waking whatever reason. First off, let
say that, somebody likes wake intense exercise
within first 90 minutes waking, well, case, appropriate


ingest caffeine just prior exercise. Not problem. Not problem.
expect combination drinking caffeine shortly waking plus
exercising intensely shortly waking will increase intensity early

personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take
week get there. get there, find quite easy maintain.
thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life
12 hours. means ingest cup coffee say 8:00
AM-- say 100 milligram coffee just sake simplicity, 25%
caffeine action-- wouldn't really say 25 milligrams, 25% caffeine
action will still present 8:00 PM night, pretty remarkable.
long arc caffeine effects, can impede sleep take caffeine
afternoon. again, somebody wakes really need caffeine
right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit
half hour later. will extend arc caffeine
effects don't need afternoon

abstaining caffeine returning caffeine intake can enhance physical

can still see physical performance-enhancing effects caffeine. Although
not quite robust abstained caffeine. design
study pretty straightforward. people either ingest 3 milligrams per kilogram
caffeine 20 consecutive days. Many people already that, realize,
people ensure that. others ingested

20 days either ingesting caffeine placebo, peak performance measured

not delay caffeine 90 120 minutes waking whatever reason. First off, let
say that, somebody likes wake intense exercise

personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take
week get there. get there, find quite easy maintain.
thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life

long arc caffeine effects, can impede sleep take caffeine
afternoon. again, somebody wakes really need caffeine
right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit
half hour later. will extend arc caffeine

caffeine 20 consecutive days. Many people already that, realize,
people ensure that. others ingested

Put comment section would. appreciate that. another


important potent use caffeine enhancing performance. relates not just
dopamine epinephrine arousal-inducing effects caffeine.
doesn't even just relate effect caffeine enhancing frontal lobe function.
include that, also includes reinforcing effects caffeine

highlighting here, also increases reinforcement pathways associated
exercise. is, creates positive feeling general theme engaging

think this, nothing else call support idea, ingesting caffeine
performance-enhancing tool makes perfect sense. don't
enjoy exercise, particular, certain forms exercise, ingesting caffeine can change

kilogram body weight mean me. safely ingest 100 300 milligrams
caffeine single dose, single drink, way consuming it, pill
form way consuming it. likely will tolerable
dose. However, not somebody accustomed drinking caffeine
regular basis, suggest start lower end 1 3 milligrams per kilogram

ingest caffeine closely wake up. want delay
caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking? answer simple.
Many people wake morning. drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes
within 2 minutes waking. feel alert naturally. makes sense
effects caffeine blocking effects adenosine talked
earlier effects neurotransmitter systems. find that,
early afternoon, particular, lunch, experience dramatic dip

mood alertness. However, soon talk about, problem ingesting
caffeine afternoon falls within 8 10 dare even say 12 hours going
sleep. is, caffeine ingested afternoon-- everybody, say
95-plus percent people-- disrupts architecture quality nighttime
sleep. say doesn't necessarily impact ability fall asleep
maybe even sleep night depth quality sleep
disrupted consuming caffeine afternoon. little bit later, talk
can offset negative effects absolutely require caffeine
afternoon. huge advantage restricting caffeine intake early
part day not consuming caffeine within first 90 120 minutes
waking. fact, many people find delay caffeine intake 90 120

forth. Now realize people just simply cannot will
not delay caffeine 90 120 minutes waking whatever reason. First off, let
say that, somebody likes wake intense exercise
within first 90 minutes waking, well, case, appropriate


ingest caffeine just prior exercise. Not problem. Not problem.
expect combination drinking caffeine shortly waking plus
exercising intensely shortly waking will increase intensity early

personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take
week get there. get there, find quite easy maintain.
thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life

long arc caffeine effects, can impede sleep take caffeine
afternoon. again, somebody wakes really need caffeine
right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit
half hour later. will extend arc caffeine
effects don't need afternoon

00:53:44 Tool: Delayed Caffeine Intake, Afternoon Crash & Sleep



might already ingesting. first tool like talk one

add additional features description tool make
worthwhile well. delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes
waking days. clear days might want
ingest caffeine closely wake up. want delay
caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking? answer simple.
Many people wake morning. drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes
within 2 minutes waking. feel alert naturally. makes sense
effects caffeine blocking effects adenosine talked
earlier effects neurotransmitter systems. find that,
early afternoon, particular, lunch, experience dramatic dip
overall levels energy, so-called afternoon crash. cases, way
respond ingest caffeine, indeed can increase levels
mood alertness. However, soon talk about, problem ingesting
caffeine afternoon falls within 8 10 dare even say 12 hours going
sleep. is, caffeine ingested afternoon-- everybody, say
95-plus percent people-- disrupts architecture quality nighttime
sleep. say doesn't necessarily impact ability fall asleep
maybe even sleep night depth quality sleep
disrupted consuming caffeine afternoon. little bit later, talk
can offset negative effects absolutely require caffeine
afternoon. huge advantage restricting caffeine intake early
part day not consuming caffeine within first 90 120 minutes
waking. fact, many people find delay caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking feel alert morning, completely
avoid afternoon crash. Now said, many people, including myself, need
short nap non-sleep deep rest form relaxation 10 30 minutes
afternoon. natural healthy. not referring need refer
so-called afternoon crash. talking afternoon crash
inability recover energy focus need consume caffeine just make
afternoon. delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking,
couple things accomplished. First all, offset afternoon


crash. effect many people experience first time start
delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. reason

adenosine there. happens accumulation,
sort glut adenosine hangs around. afternoon, effects
caffeine start wear off, will experience so-called afternoon crash.
mentioned earlier, way clear adenosine present

deliberately spike cortisol. Now, many heard cortisol, so-called
stress hormone, bad thing. indeed, chronically elevated cortisol bad thing.

tends peak close waking. fact, one reasons wake
morning, assuming weren't woken noise sleeping
environment warm, et cetera, cortisol levels start rise.
shortly waking, cortisol levels will start reach peak. refer
cortisol pulse, just biology nerd speak rise peak cortisol. want
cortisol pulse occur early day close waking, want
couple reasons. First all, don't restrict cortisol pulse early day,
will tend bleed later parts day. actually, late shifted cortisol peak
one hallmark signatures depression, low-level depression, serious
depression. can start disrupt sleep certainly can disrupt mood metabolism
immune system. want cortisol peak early day.
ensure happens? Well, wake morning. whether not
bounce-out-of-bed type groggy, kind wade slowly day
type like am, wake up, don't ingest caffeine. Fine and, fact, beneficial

certainly sun even cloudy days, fact, especially
cloudy days, get outside anywhere 5 20, maybe even 30 minutes.
work outside, take breakfast outside breakfast eater. Get something done
outside even just get outside get bright light eyes. Why? Well,
shown studies humans getting bright light eyes
first hour waking soon possible waking increases peak
cortisol pulse 50%, 5-0. cortisol pulse, yes, increases mood, yes, increases
alertness, one important thing, that, indirect

01:56:34 Tool: Exercise, Caffeine, Dopamine & Positive Reinforcement

Put comment section would. appreciate that. another


important potent use caffeine enhancing performance. relates not just
dopamine epinephrine arousal-inducing effects caffeine.
doesn't even just relate effect caffeine enhancing frontal lobe function.
include that, also includes reinforcing effects caffeine
talked beginning episode. best way illustrate
performance-enhancing effects caffeine stem directly association
reinforcement highlight study. title study "Blood dopamine level

is, title suggests, exercise, own, can increase cortisol healthy
ways, provided not intense long. little note here, trouble

unbeknownst people, ingesting 3 milligrams per kilogram caffeine prior
exercise increases dopamine release associated exercise specifically.
two important effects. First all, increase dopamine great
provides long-lasting increase focus alertness motivation, not just
exercise, also exercise. second, it-- is, caffeine

words, one way enjoy exercise enjoy activities follow exercise
experience genuine increase dopamine beneficial mood

people exercising, love exercise, love eating great, love
things beneficial health, number people really don't
like exercise. serves serious block willingness
consistency exercise. Ingesting caffeine gives us energy exercise. increases
release neurochemicals hormones good us exercise.
highlighting here, also increases reinforcement pathways associated
exercise. is, creates positive feeling general theme engaging
exercise, creates general positive experience things follow exercise.
think this, nothing else call support idea, ingesting caffeine
performance-enhancing tool makes perfect sense. don't
enjoy exercise, particular, certain forms exercise, ingesting caffeine can change
relationship exercise. words, make positive, much
way ingesting caffeine alongside certain taste otherwise
neutral maybe even negative can actually make taste particular drink
food positive. again, brings us back reinforcing properties caffeine
subconscious. not just enhanced performance test
enhanced performance treadmill weights gym. enhanced
feelings mood well-being genuine effect caffeine
certain neurotransmitter hormone systems, also creating overall milieu

02:01:55 Dopamine Stacking

reinforcing things led occur occur exercise.
want point something important relates combining things like
caffeine exercise order increase dopamine. something came
episode dopamine, motivation, drive, turns one
popular episodes. Again, can find hubermanlab.com links
formats time stamps, et cetera. also came episode ADHD
relationship ADHD dopamine. notion dopamine
stacking. episode dopamine, motivation, drive, pointed that,


near-infinite number things can increase dopamine release,
notably positive surprise positive anticipation experiencing win. Certainly,
compounds, drugs abuse, food, sex, certain supplements can
increase dopamine varying levels varying degrees, healthy unhealthy.
contained episode dopamine, motivation, drive.
pointed that, somebody tends experience difficulty
motivation-- so-called dopamine stacking called might something
want avoid. dopamine stacking? Dopamine stacking combining
highly caffeinated energy drink also includes amino acid tyrosine,
precursor dopamine, plus loud music plus getting really ramped
intense workout. can great every while.
will quickly find extent dopamine peaks also dictates extent
dopamine will drop peak. say drop, mean drop
baseline. lot people find that, stack lot things peak
dopamine, experience low, take time return
baseline. highly recommend not engaging activities consuming compounds
attempt accelerate return baseline will drive
baseline lower lower. requires able tolerate drop dopamine
baseline period time, et cetera. Now reason bringing now
context caffeine episode just described study using caffeine prior
exercise increases dopamine exercise. might saying, especially
heard earlier episode, wait, isn't dopamine stacking? Aren't
encouraging stack dopamine? Well, sense, yes. keep mind,
not suggesting every time exercise. just earlier
episode, emphasized fact that, stacking multiple stimuli-- caffeine energy
drinks music et cetera-- exercise mental work experience
matter OK every people, don't want get
habit consistently every time exercise every time go out,
instance. really want cautious. is, want protect
baseline levels dopamine peak levels dopamine. said, people
want experience increase mood, alertness, performance, want
condition themselves-- really is. conditioning
reinforcing effects dopamine increase liking maybe even loving
exercise. Occasionally, using caffeine frequently using caffeine prior exercise fine


careful. careful, mean pay attention
feel hours days dopamine increase wears off. instance,
ingest caffeine exercise intensely feeling great afterwards
eight hours later next day, feeling little bit low, suggest don't go
back exact thing right away. give little bit time
let baseline dopamine return normal. again, stacking different things,
chemical behavioral, order increase dopamine can done safe way
beneficial you, depending goals. careful not stacking many
stimuli

02:06:04 Scheduling Caffeine Maximize Effects

dopamine often. key. Early episode, mentioned one possible
caffeine-consuming schedule works well doesn't fortunately subject
long 20-day bouts 5-day even 2-day bouts abstinence. every
day schedule caffeine. look half-life caffeine look effects
dopamine system performance-enhancing effects period
abstinence can, fact, increase performance-enhancing effects caffeine--
also take consideration caffeine can habit-forming, can develop
sort tolerance caffeine. Well then, emerges
person consumes caffeine every day can actually help maximize
positive effects caffeine without subjecting kind misery occurs
accustomed consuming caffeine every single day suddenly go 2
5 20-day abstinence. never tried every day caffeine
approach, although considering based literature read.
considering specific way, consume caffeine

approximately 110 pounds. pretty comfortable ingesting
somewhere 50 150 milligrams caffeine. recommend
people considering using caffeine tool already ingesting
caffeine, start think dosage caffeine ingesting plan
ingest timing ingest caffeine relative certain tasks throughout

referring ingestion caffeine single bout, right? 1 cup coffee 2
cups coffee, instance, achieve 100 300 milligram range
appropriate body weight. avoid confusion, talk dosage
caffeine, really talking not total amount caffeine ingested per


day. talking total amount caffeine ingested one sitting setting,
is. somebody drinking caffeine multiple times throughout day,

00:53:44 Tool: Delayed Caffeine Intake, Afternoon Crash & Sleep



might already ingesting. first tool like talk one
mentioned podcast several times. something haven't
heard will useful you. heard tool before, going
add additional features description tool make
worthwhile well. delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes
waking days. clear days might want
ingest caffeine closely wake up. want delay
caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking? answer simple.
Many people wake morning. drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes
within 2 minutes waking. feel alert naturally. makes sense
effects caffeine blocking effects adenosine talked
earlier effects neurotransmitter systems. find that,
early afternoon, particular, lunch, experience dramatic dip
overall levels energy, so-called afternoon crash. cases, way
respond ingest caffeine, indeed can increase levels
mood alertness. However, soon talk about, problem ingesting
caffeine afternoon falls within 8 10 dare even say 12 hours going
sleep. is, caffeine ingested afternoon-- everybody, say
95-plus percent people-- disrupts architecture quality nighttime
sleep. say doesn't necessarily impact ability fall asleep
maybe even sleep night depth quality sleep
disrupted consuming caffeine afternoon. little bit later, talk
can offset negative effects absolutely require caffeine
afternoon. huge advantage restricting caffeine intake early
part day not consuming caffeine within first 90 120 minutes
waking. fact, many people find delay caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking feel alert morning, completely
avoid afternoon crash. Now said, many people, including myself, need
short nap non-sleep deep rest form relaxation 10 30 minutes
afternoon. natural healthy. not referring need refer
so-called afternoon crash. talking afternoon crash
inability recover energy focus need consume caffeine just make
afternoon. delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking,
couple things accomplished. First all, offset afternoon


crash. effect many people experience first time start
delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. reason
works well following. mentioned earlier, adenosine molecule builds
longer awake. molecule reduced cleared
system sleep. emerge sleep regardless long slept,
adenosine levels lower went sleep previous night.
slept well enough long enough, adenosine levels can very, low,
never completely zero. wake morning, even
one people springs bed ready attack day--
certainly not describing myself. not one people. tend wake fairly slowly.
one spring attack day one people
moves slowly day, regardless, still residual adenosine

available, zero cost, time-stamped, et cetera hubermanlab.com. wake
morning. adenosine levels low, not zero. didn't sleep
well deeply enough night before, going adenosine
system. might think logical thing therefore drink caffeine block
adenosine there. happens accumulation,
sort glut adenosine hangs around. afternoon, effects
caffeine start wear off, will experience so-called afternoon crash.
mentioned earlier, way clear adenosine present
wake morning clear essentially completely without just blocking
receptors letting accumulate hang around. way
deliberately spike cortisol. Now, many heard cortisol, so-called
stress hormone, bad thing. indeed, chronically elevated cortisol bad thing.
depletes immune system. bad psychosocial effects. tends make us
feel anxious on. cortisol not bad. Cortisol wonderful. Cortisol
enhances efficiency immune system. makes us alert focused.
stimulates metabolism. huge number positive things, provided
released circadian fashion. is, appropriate times every 24 hours


tends peak close waking. fact, one reasons wake
morning, assuming weren't woken noise sleeping
environment warm, et cetera, cortisol levels start rise.
shortly waking, cortisol levels will start reach peak. refer
cortisol pulse, just biology nerd speak rise peak cortisol. want
cortisol pulse occur early day close waking, want
couple reasons. First all, don't restrict cortisol pulse early day,
will tend bleed later parts day. actually, late shifted cortisol peak
one hallmark signatures depression, low-level depression, serious
depression. can start disrupt sleep certainly can disrupt mood metabolism
immune system. want cortisol peak early day.
ensure happens? Well, wake morning. whether not
bounce-out-of-bed type groggy, kind wade slowly day
type like am, wake up, don't ingest caffeine. Fine and, fact, beneficial
hydrate water electrolytes. Terrific. fact, say necessary get bright
light eyes ideally sunlight. talked many, many times
podcast. wake sun comes out, turn bright artificial lights.
certainly sun even cloudy days, fact, especially
cloudy days, get outside anywhere 5 20, maybe even 30 minutes.
work outside, take breakfast outside breakfast eater. Get something done
outside even just get outside get bright light eyes. Why? Well,
shown studies humans getting bright light eyes
first hour waking soon possible waking increases peak
cortisol pulse 50%, 5-0. cortisol pulse, yes, increases mood, yes, increases
alertness, one important thing, that, indirect
pathway, can clear residual adenosine might present system
wake morning. Again, going especially important
not getting much sleep much quality sleep
like. going important get morning bright light ideally
sunlight, get cortisol peak going. ways increase cortisol peak
physical activity. don't time full workout, well then, getting
movement-- 10 minutes skipping rope even 5 minutes skipping rope
jumping jacks walking time ideally getting sunlight
eyes. going zero adenosine present system. If,


however, wake immediately drink caffeine-- caffeine can
stimulate release cortisol little bit otherwise present
system. blocking adenosine receptors indirect
effects caffeine cortisol system, actually reducing clearance
adenosine otherwise occur. realize mouthful. Just
clear, wake ingest caffeine right away, blocking adenosine
receptor, not clearing out. also preventing cortisol
normal increase rise can directly clear adenosine cortisol
can clear adenosine. want. want maximum
alertness focus morning throughout day. delaying
caffeine 90 120 minutes waking, set system get
morning cortisol peak. Ideally, peak even greater getting
bright light viewing. ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes
waking, not will craving just little bit, will drinking caffeine
already existing backdrop increased alertness two reasons. One
adenosine zeroed out, cortisol peak higher. now ingest
caffeine, can actually ingest levels caffeine little reasonable
almost certainty going fall 1 3 milligrams per kilogram dosage
will allow feel really alert will carry alertness well afternoon hours
without need drink caffeine thereby will prevent drinking
caffeine disrupting nighttime sleep. And, course, getting better nighttime
sleep, going zero adenosine even more. describing
essentially two tools. telling get morning sunlight maybe
exercise conjunction even brief exercise. main tool delaying
caffeine 90 120 minutes waking immediate effects, also sets motion
cascade domino

01:04:46 Morning Exercise & Residual Caffeine Effects

falls lead better sleep wakefulness next night next day
forth. Now realize people just simply cannot will
not delay caffeine 90 120 minutes waking whatever reason. First off, let
say that, somebody likes wake intense exercise
within first 90 minutes waking, well, case, appropriate


ingest caffeine just prior exercise. Not problem. Not problem.
expect combination drinking caffeine shortly waking plus
exercising intensely shortly waking will increase intensity early
afternoon afternoon fatigue feel. Now people, great thing.
can afford take nap non-sleep deep rest, step away work,
forth. case, strongly encourage whatever allows get
regular exercise regular exercise going beneficial. fact,
entire episode called tool kit fitness describes couple different really
one main structure allows get appropriate amount resistance training
cardiovascular training flexibility training throughout week. happen follow
program, works well. involve workouts
come early morning shortly waking. cases, ingest
caffeine just prior those, within 10, 20 minutes waking. However, days,
personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take
week get there. get there, find quite easy maintain.
thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life
12 hours. means ingest cup coffee say 8:00
AM-- say 100 milligram coffee just sake simplicity, 25%
caffeine action-- wouldn't really say 25 milligrams, 25% caffeine
action will still present 8:00 PM night, pretty remarkable.
long arc caffeine effects, can impede sleep take caffeine
afternoon. again, somebody wakes really need caffeine
right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit
half hour later. will extend arc caffeine
effects don't need afternoon



01:07:56 Tool: Theanine & Jitteriness; Fasting, Intermittent Caffeine Use

won't experience afternoon crash. way caffeine works,
mention that, ingest caffeine empty stomach, will
potent stimulant effect. will also tend increase level jitteriness caffeine
can produce. Later, talk ways offset jitteriness, just tell one
tool now. Many people opt take 100 milligrams theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine, way offset jitteriness. Theanine will reduce jitteriness
caffeine, many energy drink manufacturers even coffee
manufacturers now putting theanine energy drinks ground coffee because,
no surprise, allows people consume beverage thereby purchase
beverage, vendors want without feeling overly anxious
jittery. can take pill form theanine want caffeine. don't tend
that. Rather, control total dosage caffeine. tend consume
caffeine empty stomach restrict caffeine intake early part
day. generally eat first meal somewhere around 11:00 AM,
generally last meal time around 8:00 PM so. averages.
say plus minus hour. not religiously following kind
time-restricted feeding. just tends work best schedule
appetite. again, general theme. days wake
hungry, might ingest something, small snack something. meeting
somebody breakfast, sometimes breakfast. Sometimes won't.
forth. point can get away drinking less caffeine get
stimulant effect empty stomach. somebody likes
exercise empty stomach-- one people-- well then, ingesting
caffeine just prior exercise can fantastic tool. little bit later, talk
physical performance-enhancing effects caffeine. just briefly jump
point relate morning exercise. somebody
regularly ingests caffeine-- can define regularly by, ingested caffeine
every day last two weeks, regular consumer caffeine. Whereas
somebody ingests caffeine somewhere two four times per
week, well then, not regular consumer caffeine. intermittent user
caffeine. Well, somebody regular user caffeine, performance-


enhancing effects caffeine going dramatic take two three days
off drinking caffeine, mind a-- don't want call caffeine
addict regular caffeine user. horrible notion me, aversive notion,
like effects caffeine much. really want see
maximum performance-enhancing effects caffeine, will either one two
things. will either abstain caffeine days three days prior
ingesting caffeine, will use caffeine empty stomach. clear
caffeine empty stomach enhances mental physical enhancing effects
caffeine. And, course, stated backdrop consideration
very, hungry, can make hard concentrate
forth. not encouraging people starve means. Certainly, don't
that. want maximize performance-enhancing effects caffeine,
will consume empty stomach. final point that, caffeine
diuretic. causes us lose fluid and, along fluid, excrete sodium
effects caffeine various processes within kidney. one thing works
well maintain mood alertness longer given certain amount caffeine
intake avoid jitteriness can sometimes feel like crash low blood
sugar feeling even blurry vision make sure consume least equal
volume water caffeine. ideally, water contain maybe small

day. talking total amount caffeine ingested one sitting setting,
is. somebody drinking caffeine multiple times throughout day,
can imagine-- instance, say appropriate dose order get
enhancement mental performance physical performance 200 milligrams.
somebody work morning, want lift
morning able focus better. physical exercise
afternoon vice versa ingest 200 milligrams caffeine two separate
times per day separated four hours. Now don't separate them.
put two hours apart, instance. talk half-life caffeine
forth. Just keep mind that, ingesting 200 milligrams caffeine
appropriate dose based body weight ingesting
another 200 milligrams caffeine hour later, effectively ingesting
approximately 400 milligrams caffeine, going start exceeding dose
can normally tolerate without feeling anxious jittery. said,
range tolerance caffeine based two things. One preexisting
disposition whether not genetics nervous system backdrop
life, much stress experiencing tends make feel anxious
alert jittery ingest caffeine. so-called caffeine-
adapted are. often hear tolerance. Tolerance means something
specific. ability ingest something plateau no
increase actual reduction effectiveness thing. not
really talking tolerance caffeine. talking caffeine-
adapted. simple way understand whether not caffeine-adapted not that,
drink caffeine tends increase heart rate make feel alert
bit anxious, chances not caffeine-adapted, provided
amount caffeine within healthy range you, is, ranges talked
moment ago. However, somebody drinks caffeine actually feel
alert relaxed, chances caffeine-adapted. various times
today's episode, talk people caffeine-adapted people not
caffeine-adapted. talk use caffeine every day. know
habitual caffeine drinkers including myself, just simple mention probably
sounds aversive. actually great utility using caffeine every day
opposed every day. just keep mind people will drink caffeine not
get much lift all. people will drink caffeine, will feel


extremely anxious even dosages far lower 1 3 milligrams per kilogram
body weight range described moment ago. take account
individual differences. said, 1 3 milligrams caffeine per kilogram body weight
given sitting. morning coffee morning yerba maté tea good
range start. encourage go online look various
beverages foods might eating contain caffeine. instance,
people surprised discover coffee get
standard popular vendors there, small coffee medium coffee, instance,
can contain much 400 600 milligrams caffeine. large coffee
often sold commercial vendors can contain much 1 gram, 1,000
milligrams, caffeine. Now may adapted doesn't make
feel anxious, wonder feel irritable get headache
don't get caffeine amount caffeine precisely time used
getting day, consuming quite large quantities caffeine
regular basis. recommend whether not drink soda coffee tea
figure source that. OK, figure vendor purchase
from, kind coffee, go online spend little bit time
information discover levels caffeine actually ingesting. Now
happen ingesting 1 3 milligrams per kilogram body weight
caffeine, not necessarily bad. However, want careful ingesting
high levels caffeine long periods time life can
issues start arise. particular, bias towards higher levels anxiety
depletion certain electrolytes. caffeine diuretic can cause lose
sodium things sort. also just simply dependent standpoint,
appear ingest high levels caffeine exceeding dosages
normally get away get just much mental-enhancing physical-
enhancing benefits can cause disruption microvasculature. can
bias towards headaches, anxiety attacks, can become actually quite
irritable not getting higher levels caffeine. encourage
figure not just appropriate caffeine dosage also
much caffeine

00:53:44 Tool: Delayed Caffeine Intake, Afternoon Crash & Sleep



might already ingesting. first tool like talk one
mentioned podcast several times. something haven't
heard will useful you. heard tool before, going
add additional features description tool make
worthwhile well. delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes
waking days. clear days might want
ingest caffeine closely wake up. want delay
caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking? answer simple.
Many people wake morning. drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes
within 2 minutes waking. feel alert naturally. makes sense
effects caffeine blocking effects adenosine talked
earlier effects neurotransmitter systems. find that,
early afternoon, particular, lunch, experience dramatic dip
overall levels energy, so-called afternoon crash. cases, way
respond ingest caffeine, indeed can increase levels
mood alertness. However, soon talk about, problem ingesting
caffeine afternoon falls within 8 10 dare even say 12 hours going
sleep. is, caffeine ingested afternoon-- everybody, say
95-plus percent people-- disrupts architecture quality nighttime
sleep. say doesn't necessarily impact ability fall asleep
maybe even sleep night depth quality sleep
disrupted consuming caffeine afternoon. little bit later, talk
can offset negative effects absolutely require caffeine
afternoon. huge advantage restricting caffeine intake early
part day not consuming caffeine within first 90 120 minutes
waking. fact, many people find delay caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking feel alert morning, completely
avoid afternoon crash. Now said, many people, including myself, need
short nap non-sleep deep rest form relaxation 10 30 minutes
afternoon. natural healthy. not referring need refer
so-called afternoon crash. talking afternoon crash
inability recover energy focus need consume caffeine just make
afternoon. delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking,
couple things accomplished. First all, offset afternoon


crash. effect many people experience first time start
delaying caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. reason
works well following. mentioned earlier, adenosine molecule builds
longer awake. molecule reduced cleared
system sleep. emerge sleep regardless long slept,
adenosine levels lower went sleep previous night.
slept well enough long enough, adenosine levels can very, low,
never completely zero. wake morning, even
one people springs bed ready attack day--
certainly not describing myself. not one people. tend wake fairly slowly.
one spring attack day one people
moves slowly day, regardless, still residual adenosine
system. particularly case not get enough sleep enough
depth sleep night before. correct ratio slow-wave sleep rapid eye
movement sleep. interested optimizing sleep, just refer
master sleep episode Huberman Lab podcast, perfect sleep
episode Huberman Lab podcast. tool kit sleep
available, zero cost, time-stamped, et cetera hubermanlab.com. wake
morning. adenosine levels low, not zero. didn't sleep
well deeply enough night before, going adenosine
system. might think logical thing therefore drink caffeine block
adenosine there. happens accumulation,
sort glut adenosine hangs around. afternoon, effects
caffeine start wear off, will experience so-called afternoon crash.
mentioned earlier, way clear adenosine present
wake morning clear essentially completely without just blocking
receptors letting accumulate hang around. way
deliberately spike cortisol. Now, many heard cortisol, so-called
stress hormone, bad thing. indeed, chronically elevated cortisol bad thing.
depletes immune system. bad psychosocial effects. tends make us
feel anxious on. cortisol not bad. Cortisol wonderful. Cortisol
enhances efficiency immune system. makes us alert focused.
stimulates metabolism. huge number positive things, provided
released circadian fashion. is, appropriate times every 24 hours


tends peak close waking. fact, one reasons wake
morning, assuming weren't woken noise sleeping
environment warm, et cetera, cortisol levels start rise.
shortly waking, cortisol levels will start reach peak. refer
cortisol pulse, just biology nerd speak rise peak cortisol. want
cortisol pulse occur early day close waking, want
couple reasons. First all, don't restrict cortisol pulse early day,
will tend bleed later parts day. actually, late shifted cortisol peak
one hallmark signatures depression, low-level depression, serious
depression. can start disrupt sleep certainly can disrupt mood metabolism
immune system. want cortisol peak early day.
ensure happens? Well, wake morning. whether not
bounce-out-of-bed type groggy, kind wade slowly day
type like am, wake up, don't ingest caffeine. Fine and, fact, beneficial
hydrate water electrolytes. Terrific. fact, say necessary get bright
light eyes ideally sunlight. talked many, many times
podcast. wake sun comes out, turn bright artificial lights.
certainly sun even cloudy days, fact, especially
cloudy days, get outside anywhere 5 20, maybe even 30 minutes.
work outside, take breakfast outside breakfast eater. Get something done
outside even just get outside get bright light eyes. Why? Well,
shown studies humans getting bright light eyes
first hour waking soon possible waking increases peak
cortisol pulse 50%, 5-0. cortisol pulse, yes, increases mood, yes, increases
alertness, one important thing, that, indirect
pathway, can clear residual adenosine might present system
wake morning. Again, going especially important
not getting much sleep much quality sleep
like. going important get morning bright light ideally
sunlight, get cortisol peak going. ways increase cortisol peak
physical activity. don't time full workout, well then, getting
movement-- 10 minutes skipping rope even 5 minutes skipping rope
jumping jacks walking time ideally getting sunlight
eyes. going zero adenosine present system. If,


however, wake immediately drink caffeine-- caffeine can
stimulate release cortisol little bit otherwise present
system. blocking adenosine receptors indirect
effects caffeine cortisol system, actually reducing clearance
adenosine otherwise occur. realize mouthful. Just
clear, wake ingest caffeine right away, blocking adenosine
receptor, not clearing out. also preventing cortisol
normal increase rise can directly clear adenosine cortisol
can clear adenosine. want. want maximum
alertness focus morning throughout day. delaying
caffeine 90 120 minutes waking, set system get
morning cortisol peak. Ideally, peak even greater getting
bright light viewing. ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes
waking, not will craving just little bit, will drinking caffeine
already existing backdrop increased alertness two reasons. One
adenosine zeroed out, cortisol peak higher. now ingest
caffeine, can actually ingest levels caffeine little reasonable
almost certainty going fall 1 3 milligrams per kilogram dosage
will allow feel really alert will carry alertness well afternoon hours
without need drink caffeine thereby will prevent drinking
caffeine disrupting nighttime sleep. And, course, getting better nighttime
sleep, going zero adenosine even more. describing
essentially two tools. telling get morning sunlight maybe
exercise conjunction even brief exercise. main tool delaying
caffeine 90 120 minutes waking immediate effects, also sets motion
cascade domino

01:04:46 Morning Exercise & Residual Caffeine Effects

falls lead better sleep wakefulness next night next day
forth. Now realize people just simply cannot will
not delay caffeine 90 120 minutes waking whatever reason. First off, let
say that, somebody likes wake intense exercise
within first 90 minutes waking, well, case, appropriate


ingest caffeine just prior exercise. Not problem. Not problem.
expect combination drinking caffeine shortly waking plus
exercising intensely shortly waking will increase intensity early
afternoon afternoon fatigue feel. Now people, great thing.
can afford take nap non-sleep deep rest, step away work,
forth. case, strongly encourage whatever allows get
regular exercise regular exercise going beneficial. fact,
entire episode called tool kit fitness describes couple different really
one main structure allows get appropriate amount resistance training
cardiovascular training flexibility training throughout week. happen follow
program, works well. involve workouts
come early morning shortly waking. cases, ingest
caffeine just prior those, within 10, 20 minutes waking. However, days,
personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take
week get there. get there, find quite easy maintain.
thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life
12 hours. means ingest cup coffee say 8:00
AM-- say 100 milligram coffee just sake simplicity, 25%
caffeine action-- wouldn't really say 25 milligrams, 25% caffeine
action will still present 8:00 PM night, pretty remarkable.
long arc caffeine effects, can impede sleep take caffeine
afternoon. again, somebody wakes really need caffeine
right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit
half hour later. will extend arc caffeine
effects don't need afternoon



01:07:56 Tool: Theanine & Jitteriness; Fasting, Intermittent Caffeine Use

won't experience afternoon crash. way caffeine works,
mention that, ingest caffeine empty stomach, will
potent stimulant effect. will also tend increase level jitteriness caffeine
can produce. Later, talk ways offset jitteriness, just tell one
tool now. Many people opt take 100 milligrams theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine, way offset jitteriness. Theanine will reduce jitteriness
caffeine, many energy drink manufacturers even coffee
manufacturers now putting theanine energy drinks ground coffee because,
no surprise, allows people consume beverage thereby purchase
beverage, vendors want without feeling overly anxious
jittery. can take pill form theanine want caffeine. don't tend
that. Rather, control total dosage caffeine. tend consume
caffeine empty stomach restrict caffeine intake early part
day. generally eat first meal somewhere around 11:00 AM,
generally last meal time around 8:00 PM so. averages.
say plus minus hour. not religiously following kind
time-restricted feeding. just tends work best schedule
appetite. again, general theme. days wake
hungry, might ingest something, small snack something. meeting
somebody breakfast, sometimes breakfast. Sometimes won't.
forth. point can get away drinking less caffeine get
stimulant effect empty stomach. somebody likes
exercise empty stomach-- one people-- well then, ingesting
caffeine just prior exercise can fantastic tool. little bit later, talk
physical performance-enhancing effects caffeine. just briefly jump
point relate morning exercise. somebody
regularly ingests caffeine-- can define regularly by, ingested caffeine
every day last two weeks, regular consumer caffeine. Whereas
somebody ingests caffeine somewhere two four times per
week, well then, not regular consumer caffeine. intermittent user
caffeine. Well, somebody regular user caffeine, performance-


enhancing effects caffeine going dramatic take two three days
off drinking caffeine, mind a-- don't want call caffeine
addict regular caffeine user. horrible notion me, aversive notion,
like effects caffeine much. really want see
maximum performance-enhancing effects caffeine, will either one two
things. will either abstain caffeine days three days prior
ingesting caffeine, will use caffeine empty stomach. clear
caffeine empty stomach enhances mental physical enhancing effects
caffeine. And, course, stated backdrop consideration
very, hungry, can make hard concentrate
forth. not encouraging people starve means. Certainly, don't
that. want maximize performance-enhancing effects caffeine,
will consume empty stomach. final point that, caffeine
diuretic. causes us lose fluid and, along fluid, excrete sodium
effects caffeine various processes within kidney. one thing works
well maintain mood alertness longer given certain amount caffeine
intake avoid jitteriness can sometimes feel like crash low blood
sugar feeling even blurry vision make sure consume least equal
volume water caffeine. ideally, water contain maybe small
pinch salt sort electrolyte drink-- powder, rather. me, use element.
Full disclosure, podcast affiliate sponsor. don't need that.
simply just glass water alongside coffee espresso
yerba maté just put small pinch sea salt evem just playing table salt.
will help offset jitteriness caffeine. lot people think that,
ingest caffeine, get jitteriness crash blood sugar
low. can case, oftentimes, simply excretion
sodium occurred ingested caffeine. encourage hydrate
well hydrate something contains little bit sodium. Obviously, not
much increases hypertension something sort small amount
sodium electrolyte drink like Element. electrolyte drinks
can accomplish same, course. Just couple quick notes
theanine growing number products contain
theanine. certainly growing number people using
theanine effect described before,

forth. Now realize people just simply cannot will
not delay caffeine 90 120 minutes waking whatever reason. First off, let
say that, somebody likes wake intense exercise
within first 90 minutes waking, well, case, appropriate


ingest caffeine just prior exercise. Not problem. Not problem.
expect combination drinking caffeine shortly waking plus
exercising intensely shortly waking will increase intensity early
afternoon afternoon fatigue feel. Now people, great thing.

entire episode called tool kit fitness describes couple different really
one main structure allows get appropriate amount resistance training
cardiovascular training flexibility training throughout week. happen follow
program, works well. involve workouts
come early morning shortly waking. cases, ingest
caffeine just prior those, within 10, 20 minutes waking. However, days,
personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take
week get there. get there, find quite easy maintain.
thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life
12 hours. means ingest cup coffee say 8:00
AM-- say 100 milligram coffee just sake simplicity, 25%
caffeine action-- wouldn't really say 25 milligrams, 25% caffeine
action will still present 8:00 PM night, pretty remarkable.
long arc caffeine effects, can impede sleep take caffeine
afternoon. again, somebody wakes really need caffeine
right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit
half hour later. will extend arc caffeine
effects don't need afternoon



01:07:56 Tool: Theanine & Jitteriness; Fasting, Intermittent Caffeine Use

won't experience afternoon crash. way caffeine works,
mention that, ingest caffeine empty stomach, will
potent stimulant effect. will also tend increase level jitteriness caffeine
can produce. Later, talk ways offset jitteriness, just tell one
tool now. Many people opt take 100 milligrams theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine, way offset jitteriness. Theanine will reduce jitteriness
caffeine, many energy drink manufacturers even coffee
manufacturers now putting theanine energy drinks ground coffee because,
no surprise, allows people consume beverage thereby purchase
beverage, vendors want without feeling overly anxious
jittery. can take pill form theanine want caffeine. don't tend
that. Rather, control total dosage caffeine. tend consume
caffeine empty stomach restrict caffeine intake early part

regularly ingests caffeine-- can define regularly by, ingested caffeine
every day last two weeks, regular consumer caffeine. Whereas
somebody ingests caffeine somewhere two four times per

Put comment section would. appreciate that. another


important potent use caffeine enhancing performance. relates not just
dopamine epinephrine arousal-inducing effects caffeine.
doesn't even just relate effect caffeine enhancing frontal lobe function.
include that, also includes reinforcing effects caffeine

think this, nothing else call support idea, ingesting caffeine

waking days. clear days might want
ingest caffeine closely wake up. want delay
caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking? answer simple.
Many people wake morning. drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes
within 2 minutes waking. feel alert naturally. makes sense
effects caffeine blocking effects adenosine talked
earlier effects neurotransmitter systems. find that,
early afternoon, particular, lunch, experience dramatic dip
overall levels energy, so-called afternoon crash. cases, way
respond ingest caffeine, indeed can increase levels
mood alertness. However, soon talk about, problem ingesting
caffeine afternoon falls within 8 10 dare even say 12 hours going
sleep. is, caffeine ingested afternoon-- everybody, say
95-plus percent people-- disrupts architecture quality nighttime
sleep. say doesn't necessarily impact ability fall asleep
maybe even sleep night depth quality sleep
disrupted consuming caffeine afternoon. little bit later, talk
can offset negative effects absolutely require caffeine
afternoon. huge advantage restricting caffeine intake early
part day not consuming caffeine within first 90 120 minutes

forth. Now realize people just simply cannot will
not delay caffeine 90 120 minutes waking whatever reason. First off, let
say that, somebody likes wake intense exercise
within first 90 minutes waking, well, case, appropriate


ingest caffeine just prior exercise. Not problem. Not problem.
expect combination drinking caffeine shortly waking plus
exercising intensely shortly waking will increase intensity early

entire episode called tool kit fitness describes couple different really
one main structure allows get appropriate amount resistance training
cardiovascular training flexibility training throughout week. happen follow

come early morning shortly waking. cases, ingest
caffeine just prior those, within 10, 20 minutes waking. However, days,
personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take
week get there. get there, find quite easy maintain.
thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life
12 hours. means ingest cup coffee say 8:00
AM-- say 100 milligram coffee just sake simplicity, 25%
caffeine action-- wouldn't really say 25 milligrams, 25% caffeine
action will still present 8:00 PM night, pretty remarkable.
long arc caffeine effects, can impede sleep take caffeine
afternoon. again, somebody wakes really need caffeine
right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit
half hour later. will extend arc caffeine
effects don't need afternoon

forth. Now realize people just simply cannot will
not delay caffeine 90 120 minutes waking whatever reason. First off, let
say that, somebody likes wake intense exercise
within first 90 minutes waking, well, case, appropriate


ingest caffeine just prior exercise. Not problem. Not problem.
expect combination drinking caffeine shortly waking plus
exercising intensely shortly waking will increase intensity early
afternoon afternoon fatigue feel. Now people, great thing.
can afford take nap non-sleep deep rest, step away work,
forth. case, strongly encourage whatever allows get
regular exercise regular exercise going beneficial. fact,
entire episode called tool kit fitness describes couple different really
one main structure allows get appropriate amount resistance training
cardiovascular training flexibility training throughout week. happen follow
program, works well. involve workouts
come early morning shortly waking. cases, ingest
caffeine just prior those, within 10, 20 minutes waking. However, days,
personally delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes, done great
benefit. people, not, people try that, reported same.
mention people will find getting 90 minutes excruciatingly
difficult accustomed ingesting caffeine close waking up.
case, maybe just push caffeine intake 15 minutes day
hit 90 120-minute mark. will make much easier. might take
week get there. get there, find quite easy maintain.
thing that, somebody insists drinking caffeine shortly
waking, encourage drink half caffeine
half caffeine hour later. also will help offset afternoon
crash reasons related so-called kinetics caffeine. Caffeine quarter life
12 hours. means ingest cup coffee say 8:00
AM-- say 100 milligram coffee just sake simplicity, 25%
caffeine action-- wouldn't really say 25 milligrams, 25% caffeine
action will still present 8:00 PM night, pretty remarkable.
long arc caffeine effects, can impede sleep take caffeine
afternoon. again, somebody wakes really need caffeine
right away refuse 90 120-minute delay thing talking about,
well then, case, drink half caffeine upon waking little bit
half hour later. will extend arc caffeine
effects don't need afternoon



01:07:56 Tool: Theanine & Jitteriness; Fasting, Intermittent Caffeine Use

won't experience afternoon crash. way caffeine works,
mention that, ingest caffeine empty stomach, will
potent stimulant effect. will also tend increase level jitteriness caffeine
can produce. Later, talk ways offset jitteriness, just tell one
tool now. Many people opt take 100 milligrams theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine, way offset jitteriness. Theanine will reduce jitteriness
caffeine, many energy drink manufacturers even coffee
manufacturers now putting theanine energy drinks ground coffee because,
no surprise, allows people consume beverage thereby purchase
beverage, vendors want without feeling overly anxious
jittery. can take pill form theanine want caffeine. don't tend
that. Rather, control total dosage caffeine. tend consume
caffeine empty stomach restrict caffeine intake early part
day. generally eat first meal somewhere around 11:00 AM,
generally last meal time around 8:00 PM so. averages.

physical performance-enhancing effects caffeine. just briefly jump
point relate morning exercise. somebody
regularly ingests caffeine-- can define regularly by, ingested caffeine
every day last two weeks, regular consumer caffeine. Whereas
somebody ingests caffeine somewhere two four times per
week, well then, not regular consumer caffeine. intermittent user
caffeine. Well, somebody regular user caffeine, performance-

highlighting here, also increases reinforcement pathways associated
exercise. is, creates positive feeling general theme engaging
exercise, creates general positive experience things follow exercise.
think this, nothing else call support idea, ingesting caffeine
performance-enhancing tool makes perfect sense. don't
enjoy exercise, particular, certain forms exercise, ingesting caffeine can change
relationship exercise. words, make positive, much
way ingesting caffeine alongside certain taste otherwise
neutral maybe even negative can actually make taste particular drink

contained episode dopamine, motivation, drive.
pointed that, somebody tends experience difficulty
motivation-- so-called dopamine stacking called might something
want avoid. dopamine stacking? Dopamine stacking combining
highly caffeinated energy drink also includes amino acid tyrosine,

context caffeine episode just described study using caffeine prior
exercise increases dopamine exercise. might saying, especially
heard earlier episode, wait, isn't dopamine stacking? Aren't
encouraging stack dopamine? Well, sense, yes. keep mind,
not suggesting every time exercise. just earlier
episode, emphasized fact that, stacking multiple stimuli-- caffeine energy

let baseline dopamine return normal. again, stacking different things,
chemical behavioral, order increase dopamine can done safe way
beneficial you, depending goals. careful not stacking many

02:06:04 Scheduling Caffeine Maximize Effects

dopamine often. key. Early episode, mentioned one possible
caffeine-consuming schedule works well doesn't fortunately subject

dopamine system performance-enhancing effects period
abstinence can, fact, increase performance-enhancing effects caffeine--
also take consideration caffeine can habit-forming, can develop

Perhaps planning travel new time zone, want use caffeine

case. Others might interested pro-physical performance effects
caffeine. talk little bit. want get maximum

interesting study. title "Time course tolerance performance


effects caffeine." like study that, yes, say
abstaining caffeine returning caffeine intake can enhance physical
performance specific way, also says that, take caffeine regularly,
can still see physical performance-enhancing effects caffeine. Although
not quite robust abstained caffeine. design
study pretty straightforward. people either ingest 3 milligrams per kilogram
caffeine 20 consecutive days. Many people already that, realize,
people ensure that. others ingested
placebo 20 days, abstained caffeine without realizing it.
20 days either ingesting caffeine placebo, peak performance measured

20 days caffeine 21st day caffeine physical task
21st day. 20 days abstinence caffeine. day 21, get

people abstained caffeine. people consumed caffeine
way day, still effective ingest caffeine day 21 not
effective abstained. fact, magnitude
call ergogenic effect, pro-performance-enhancing effect caffeine,
higher first day subsequent days allowed people
continue caffeine intake. takeaway study really straightforward.
want get maximum physical performance-enhancing effects caffeine,
abstain caffeine 20 days. day 21, going physical
thing, task, ingest caffeine 30 minutes hour

five days abstinence prior even two days abstinence prior.
intolerable mind, me, just reduce caffeine intake

maybe even three weeks preceding physical mental challenge. Now again,
sort implies going marathon, going

Put comment section would. appreciate that. another


important potent use caffeine enhancing performance. relates not just
dopamine epinephrine arousal-inducing effects caffeine.
doesn't even just relate effect caffeine enhancing frontal lobe function.
include that, also includes reinforcing effects caffeine

highlighting here, also increases reinforcement pathways associated
exercise. is, creates positive feeling general theme engaging

think this, nothing else call support idea, ingesting caffeine
performance-enhancing tool makes perfect sense. don't

pointed that, somebody tends experience difficulty

encouraging stack dopamine? Well, sense, yes. keep mind,
not suggesting every time exercise. just earlier
episode, emphasized fact that, stacking multiple stimuli-- caffeine energy

let baseline dopamine return normal. again, stacking different things,
chemical behavioral, order increase dopamine can done safe way
beneficial you, depending goals. careful not stacking many

observed following. Cortisol responses caffeine reduced not

not quite robust abstained caffeine. design
study pretty straightforward. people either ingest 3 milligrams per kilogram

important point. point likely exacerbates observed pro-

not quite robust abstained caffeine. design
study pretty straightforward. people either ingest 3 milligrams per kilogram

nice study, showed quote, "Caffeine increased peak aerobic cycling power
early follicular, preovulatory, midluteal phases menstrual cycle." Thus,
ingestion-- again, use 3 milligrams caffeine per kilogram body mass
might considered ergogenic aid women menstrual cycle
three phases cycle. keep mind, women--
regular users caffeine using caffeine enhance physical performance,

01:56:34 Tool: Exercise, Caffeine, Dopamine & Positive Reinforcement

Put comment section would. appreciate that. another


important potent use caffeine enhancing performance. relates not just
dopamine epinephrine arousal-inducing effects caffeine.
doesn't even just relate effect caffeine enhancing frontal lobe function.
include that, also includes reinforcing effects caffeine

highlighting here, also increases reinforcement pathways associated
exercise. is, creates positive feeling general theme engaging

think this, nothing else call support idea, ingesting caffeine
performance-enhancing tool makes perfect sense. don't

01:56:34 Tool: Exercise, Caffeine, Dopamine & Positive Reinforcement

Put comment section would. appreciate that. another


important potent use caffeine enhancing performance. relates not just
dopamine epinephrine arousal-inducing effects caffeine.
doesn't even just relate effect caffeine enhancing frontal lobe function.
include that, also includes reinforcing effects caffeine
talked beginning episode. best way illustrate
performance-enhancing effects caffeine stem directly association
reinforcement highlight study. title study "Blood dopamine level

is, title suggests, exercise, own, can increase cortisol healthy
ways, provided not intense long. little note here, trouble

people exercising, love exercise, love eating great, love
things beneficial health, number people really don't
like exercise. serves serious block willingness
consistency exercise. Ingesting caffeine gives us energy exercise. increases
release neurochemicals hormones good us exercise.
highlighting here, also increases reinforcement pathways associated
exercise. is, creates positive feeling general theme engaging
exercise, creates general positive experience things follow exercise.
think this, nothing else call support idea, ingesting caffeine
performance-enhancing tool makes perfect sense. don't
enjoy exercise, particular, certain forms exercise, ingesting caffeine can change
relationship exercise. words, make positive, much
way ingesting caffeine alongside certain taste otherwise
neutral maybe even negative can actually make taste particular drink
food positive. again, brings us back reinforcing properties caffeine

careful. careful, mean pay attention
feel hours days dopamine increase wears off. instance,
ingest caffeine exercise intensely feeling great afterwards
eight hours later next day, feeling little bit low, suggest don't go

one relates performance published 2020 European
Journal Nutrition, "Ergogenic effects caffeine peak aerobic cycling

nice study, showed quote, "Caffeine increased peak aerobic cycling power
early follicular, preovulatory, midluteal phases menstrual cycle." Thus,
ingestion-- again, use 3 milligrams caffeine per kilogram body mass
might considered ergogenic aid women menstrual cycle
three phases cycle. keep mind, women--
regular users caffeine using caffeine enhance physical performance,

case. is, research supports fact. experienced fact that,
abstain caffeine trying learn something-- drink caffeine
immediately after. Somewhat surprisingly certainly way consistent
research literature, memory information focused prior
ingesting caffeine much greater. talking personal

think it, makes perfect sense way memory systems
brain organized go life experiencing things. encounter
surprises good bad. go motions things typical,
mundane, exciting, novel, not novel. every while, something

ingesting caffeine afternoon, realize many students people
comfortable staying wee hours night waking late
next day might compatible schedule. again, sleep-
diminishing effects caffeine-- talked earlier. not crazy idea
people ingesting caffeine late afternoon order perform better late
afternoon. Far better restrict caffeine intake early part day
talked earlier. reason data things like non-sleep deep
rest naps afternoon-- again, rule don't nap.
want nap, shown naps 90 minutes less non-sleep deep

01:56:34 Tool: Exercise, Caffeine, Dopamine & Positive Reinforcement

Put comment section would. appreciate that. another


important potent use caffeine enhancing performance. relates not just
dopamine epinephrine arousal-inducing effects caffeine.
doesn't even just relate effect caffeine enhancing frontal lobe function.
include that, also includes reinforcing effects caffeine
talked beginning episode. best way illustrate
performance-enhancing effects caffeine stem directly association
reinforcement highlight study. title study "Blood dopamine level
enhanced caffeine men treadmill running." title suggests,
carried men, no reason think results wouldn't also
present women. sex-dependent effects caffeine. touch just
briefly end. largely present kids. is, adolescents teens
opposed adults. study really interesting. people
run treadmill either ingest caffeine-- again, 3 milligrams per kilogram body
weight-- not ingest caffeine. looked levels dopamine
neurotransmitters hormones, prolactin cortisol. basic takeaway
is, title suggests, exercise, own, can increase cortisol healthy
ways, provided not intense long. little note here, trouble
recovering exercise want continue derive benefits exercise,
general, best not high-intensity exercise longer 75 minutes. 90 minutes
probably outer threshold. realized genetic freaks
people chemically assisted can recover intense long
bouts exercise. people don't well long bouts intense exercise
regular basis. limiting intense exercise 60 minutes less-- doesn't
include warm-up-- going beneficial. See episode tool kit fitness
like details that. Exercise known increase levels dopamine, cortisol,
catecholamines neurotransmitters potently things like testosterone
estrogen ways know beneficial us and, course,
positive effects musculoskeletal system cardiovascular effects.
unbeknownst people, ingesting 3 milligrams per kilogram caffeine prior
exercise increases dopamine release associated exercise specifically.
two important effects. First all, increase dopamine great
provides long-lasting increase focus alertness motivation, not just
exercise, also exercise. second, it-- is, caffeine
dopamine combination-- act reinforcer make experience exercise


period immediate exercise pleasant and, fact, reinforcing.
words, one way enjoy exercise enjoy activities follow exercise
experience genuine increase dopamine beneficial mood
alertness ingest caffeine prior exercise. Now important number
people exercising, love exercise, love eating great, love
things beneficial health, number people really don't
like exercise. serves serious block willingness
consistency exercise. Ingesting caffeine gives us energy exercise. increases
release neurochemicals hormones good us exercise.
highlighting here, also increases reinforcement pathways associated
exercise. is, creates positive feeling general theme engaging
exercise, creates general positive experience things follow exercise.
think this, nothing else call support idea, ingesting caffeine
performance-enhancing tool makes perfect sense. don't
enjoy exercise, particular, certain forms exercise, ingesting caffeine can change
relationship exercise. words, make positive, much
way ingesting caffeine alongside certain taste otherwise
neutral maybe even negative can actually make taste particular drink
food positive. again, brings us back reinforcing properties caffeine
subconscious. not just enhanced performance test
enhanced performance treadmill weights gym. enhanced
feelings mood well-being genuine effect caffeine
certain neurotransmitter hormone systems, also creating overall milieu

02:01:55 Dopamine Stacking

reinforcing things led occur occur exercise.
want point something important relates combining things like
caffeine exercise order increase dopamine. something came
episode dopamine, motivation, drive, turns one
popular episodes. Again, can find hubermanlab.com links
formats time stamps, et cetera. also came episode ADHD
relationship ADHD dopamine. notion dopamine
stacking. episode dopamine, motivation, drive, pointed that,


near-infinite number things can increase dopamine release,
notably positive surprise positive anticipation experiencing win. Certainly,
compounds, drugs abuse, food, sex, certain supplements can
increase dopamine varying levels varying degrees, healthy unhealthy.
contained episode dopamine, motivation, drive.
pointed that, somebody tends experience difficulty
motivation-- so-called dopamine stacking called might something
want avoid. dopamine stacking? Dopamine stacking combining
highly caffeinated energy drink also includes amino acid tyrosine,
precursor dopamine, plus loud music plus getting really ramped
intense workout. can great every while.
will quickly find extent dopamine peaks also dictates extent
dopamine will drop peak. say drop, mean drop
baseline. lot people find that, stack lot things peak
dopamine, experience low, take time return
baseline. highly recommend not engaging activities consuming compounds
attempt accelerate return baseline will drive
baseline lower lower. requires able tolerate drop dopamine
baseline period time, et cetera. Now reason bringing now
context caffeine episode just described study using caffeine prior
exercise increases dopamine exercise. might saying, especially
heard earlier episode, wait, isn't dopamine stacking? Aren't
encouraging stack dopamine? Well, sense, yes. keep mind,
not suggesting every time exercise. just earlier
episode, emphasized fact that, stacking multiple stimuli-- caffeine energy
drinks music et cetera-- exercise mental work experience
matter OK every people, don't want get
habit consistently every time exercise every time go out,
instance. really want cautious. is, want protect
baseline levels dopamine peak levels dopamine. said, people
want experience increase mood, alertness, performance, want
condition themselves-- really is. conditioning
reinforcing effects dopamine increase liking maybe even loving
exercise. Occasionally, using caffeine frequently using caffeine prior exercise fine


careful. careful, mean pay attention
feel hours days dopamine increase wears off. instance,
ingest caffeine exercise intensely feeling great afterwards
eight hours later next day, feeling little bit low, suggest don't go
back exact thing right away. give little bit time
let baseline dopamine return normal. again, stacking different things,
chemical behavioral, order increase dopamine can done safe way
beneficial you, depending goals. careful not stacking many
stimuli

02:06:04 Scheduling Caffeine Maximize Effects

dopamine often. key. Early episode, mentioned one possible
caffeine-consuming schedule works well doesn't fortunately subject
long 20-day bouts 5-day even 2-day bouts abstinence. every
day schedule caffeine. look half-life caffeine look effects
dopamine system performance-enhancing effects period
abstinence can, fact, increase performance-enhancing effects caffeine--
also take consideration caffeine can habit-forming, can develop
sort tolerance caffeine. Well then, emerges
person consumes caffeine every day can actually help maximize
positive effects caffeine without subjecting kind misery occurs
accustomed consuming caffeine every single day suddenly go 2
5 20-day abstinence. never tried every day caffeine
approach, although considering based literature read.
considering specific way, consume caffeine
days resistance train. since tend three four days
per week organized way every day-- again, want see

reasons rationale maps scientific literature,

rational one one wants maximize performance-enhancing effects


caffeine without suffering effects caffeine withdrawal associated

every-other-day caffeine schedule

02:08:33 Pro-Health Effects Caffeine

seem rational scientifically grounded one order maximize
effects. addition so-called performance-enhancing effects caffeine,
also well studied now fairly well mechanistically understood pro-health
effects caffeine. Now, talk pro-health effects caffeine, want
clear that, schedule caffeine intake-- is, timing caffeine
intake anything else matter-- offsets getting regular high quality sleep
sufficient duration, well, undermining pro-health effects thing.

absolutely case anything, whether not good bad
short term, disrupts sleep timing thing
going undermine immediate long-term health long.
said, several well described health-promoting effects caffeine ingestion.
again, say caffeine ingestion, referring 1 3 milligrams per
kilogram body weight dosage. really nice studies showing
regular consumer caffeine can help offset probability,
probability developing Parkinson's maybe Alzheimer's-related dementia well.
not terribly controversial data fact caffeine known

think this, nothing else call support idea, ingesting caffeine
performance-enhancing tool makes perfect sense. don't

baseline period time, et cetera. Now reason bringing now
context caffeine episode just described study using caffeine prior
exercise increases dopamine exercise. might saying, especially
heard earlier episode, wait, isn't dopamine stacking? Aren't
encouraging stack dopamine? Well, sense, yes. keep mind,
not suggesting every time exercise. just earlier
episode, emphasized fact that, stacking multiple stimuli-- caffeine energy

contained episode dopamine, motivation, drive.
pointed that, somebody tends experience difficulty
motivation-- so-called dopamine stacking called might something

dopamine, experience low, take time return

encouraging stack dopamine? Well, sense, yes. keep mind,
not suggesting every time exercise. just earlier
episode, emphasized fact that, stacking multiple stimuli-- caffeine energy

reinforcing effects dopamine increase liking maybe even loving
exercise. Occasionally, using caffeine frequently using caffeine prior exercise fine


careful. careful, mean pay attention
feel hours days dopamine increase wears off. instance,
ingest caffeine exercise intensely feeling great afterwards
eight hours later next day, feeling little bit low, suggest don't go
