00:06:45 Cold Showers, Ice Baths, Cryotherapy

five free travel packs year's supply vitamin D3K2. now
discussion Dr. Craig Heller. Great here. - good here. - Yeah.
long time coming. know many people lot questions
use cold. one things happened recent years
many reasons, people become interested things like taking cold showers
taking ice baths many different purposes. Sometimes introduced just
general health tonic, times people get specific can improve
resilience can improve one's metabolism. just tell little bit
happens get cold shower ice bath? basic
responses level metabolism? Obviously psychologically, don't know exactly.
It'll vary person person, happens submerge ice
bath never done before? - Well, first all, get tremendous shock.
going translate bit shot adrenaline. think really
so-called benefit, wouldn't call benefit, cryo chambers. go
cryo chamber shock. get shot adrenaline. So, sure. going
feel different come out. shot adrenaline. doesn't
necessarily translate benefit terms physiology performance,
forth. Now take cold bath cold shower, couple things happening.
One going stimulate vasoconstriction. anything, going make
little bit difficult body get rid heat, shutting off
avenues heat loss. true cold bath, overall surface area body
great doesn't matter vasoconstricted, still going lose heat. -
Okay, vasoconstriction, constriction of, capillaries, vessels arteries


constrict just one two? - Well, area controversy. general,
people talk vasoconstriction, talk overall skin surface, not true.
primary sites heat loss, going get into, palms
hands, soles feet, upper part face. reason
avenues heat loss underlain special blood vessels. blood
vessels able shunt blood arteries, coming heart,
directly veins, returning heart, bypassing capillaries,
nutritive vessels, high resistance. can tell shake
someone's hand thermal status is. hand's hot cold. -
think part reason humans evolved practice shaking hands?
[Craig chuckles] Assessing other's level anxiety? know limp shake
pretty indicative something firm handshake indicatives something,
crushing handshake matter, right? - Yeah, really don't know
evolutionary origin handshaking is, get hand away
weapon, [chuckles] perhaps. - Right, couple questions get
specialized vascular compartments soles, palms upper face.
mentioned whole body immersion, like ice bath cold water neck
versus cold shower. something fundamentally different two,
besides fact provide release adrenaline? anything
really important

00:10:45 Boundary Layers

understand difference physiological response evoked cold shower
versus immersion cold? - Well, differences physical
anything else. cold bath still, develop boundary layer.
shower, can't develop boundary layer. - explain
boundary layer is? - Yes, best explain terms hot bath, 'cause everybody's
experienced that. get hot bath and, oh God, really hot, almost painful.
sit eventually doesn't feel hot anymore, still
water, close skin, coming equilibrium skin. like
blanket insulator you. move around, disturb
still water layer. feel hot temperature again. - see, get
cold ice bath cold body water kind stay still, likely feel warmer


least I- - not going losing much heat. - see. - Right. -
move in- - flail around, flail around, going lose
heat.

00:11:55 Cooling Aerobic Activity Enhance Performance

- Got it. - Yeah. think getting back original question benefits,
keep mind whether talking aerobic activity anaerobic activity,
referring performance exercise, forth. aerobic
activity can sustain long time, production heat rising gradually
distributed throughout body. eventually body temperature
going come level going impair performance. benefit
cold bath cold shower aerobic activity increase capacity
body mass absorb excess heat. - see, say that, rough
sense, protocol one might use going head long run? -
Yep. - Even reasonably warm day, not super hot, maybe super hot,
take cool shower go run. beneficial? - Sure, it'll take
longer get sweat point heat up. - will translate terms
performance benefit? - Well, increase speed, depends
use benefit. people pacers. will go pace
will go farther. people are, going say pacers regulators and, no, no.
Pacers forcers. will take advantage use fast can.
will go faster, not necessarily farther. - see, far know, not many
athletes, least not ones know, getting cool bodies water, taking
cold showers head train. sounds like real
performance benefit there. - benefit. know going talk
technology cooling, one point our, don't know using now,
cross-country team, go compete hot place,
warm-up exercises, stretching. extract heat
beginning race. like think greater scope heat
absorption. - Interesting, long one need take one showers
cold immersions heading run? Roughly speaking, don't get
details, everyone's performance level regimen going different,
live going different, et cetera. - not long think.


minutes. - Couple minutes? - Yeah. going happen core
temperature goes down, will eventually shut off heat loss. keeps
going normal. warmed temperature

00:14:45 Anaerobic Activity Locally Increases Muscle Heat

risen half degree, say, doesn't take minutes extract
heat vasodilated. - Interesting, anaerobic athlete?
strength athlete. - Right. anaerobic athlete, say
several sets many reps, whatever doing, core temperature's not
going rise fast, certain muscles used,
temperature muscles will go up. - local effect. - local effect, right. -
Okay. say, sake today, maybe discussion, assume
basic workout, even though people variation 5 sets 5 10 sets 10.
listening, 5 sets 10 5 rep repetitions, 10 sets 10
repetitions, 10 10, 5 5. Yeah, somebody, say, large body
compound movement, like barbell squats lot large body
movements, hip hinging, et cetera. instance, biceps not, involved,
less indirectly. - Right. - effect going heat
quadriceps, heat hamstrings, heat glutes, kind thing. - Right. - see.
- rest, heat will leave muscle, not fast. certainly
heat can't leave muscle fast working out, muscle
contracts, squeezes blood vessels. way heat gets muscle
blood. muscle metabolism can go 50 60-fold anaerobic
activity. means heat production muscle goes 50 60-fold. blood
flow muscle cannot go 50 60-fold. literally capacity cook
muscles. [Craig chuckles]

00:16:45 Temperature Gates Energy Use

- probably appropriate time just mention briefly underlying
mechanism is. will return specifics one can mitigate
heating up, just explain relationship energy production ATP
pyruvate kinase role heat there? - Sure. don't get something


nothing. like steam engine, energy food lost heat.
roughly 20% efficient. energy take food, 20%
can go work, rest lost heat. Now mammals.
use heat keep body temperature considerably environment.
raise body temperature degrees higher, trouble, hyperthermia.
individual muscles can reach hyperthermic limits might experience
whole body. keep damaging muscle hyperthermia,
fail-safe mechanisms. one fail-safe mechanisms enzyme
critical getting fuel. words, results metabolism glucose, getting
fuel mitochondria, making major coinage energy exchange, ATP,
okay? particular enzyme temperature-sensitive. muscle
temperature gets 39 39.5, shuts off. essentially shuts off fuel
supply mitochondria. cannot one rep. - failure,
say that- - Muscle failure. - One component muscular failure overheating
muscle locally? - Right. - There're probably things too. - Well, you, yeah,
lack oxygen, oxygen delivery pretty good muscle. run
glucose, yeah. going impair you. immediate, immediate
impairment muscle activity, muscle fatigue, words,

00:19:00 Local Versus Systemic Fatigue: Heat Fail

rise temperature muscle. - Interesting, want talk
muscle fails locally, burning question mind cannot seem
answer myself. hoping can answer me. say five sets
five squats. hit fit muscular failure given weight. according now
know, quadriceps muscles associated, mean, squat
failed heat triggering, mechanism triggered heat shuts off
muscle. biceps nice cool, telling me. not much
work. indirect work. can't set bar squat rack,
walk barbell curls intensity
barbell curls fresh, not done anything prior? - Well, will still fatigue
curve upper body, okay? will influenced rise temperature
generated lower body exercise. - temperature cases
limiting factor? - one limiting factor. one limiting factor. - find amazing.


find amazing always thought naively reason muscles fail
because, quote, don't strength another repetition. lack glycogen
ability access glycogen. course, still glycogen. naive
think that, wait three minutes go back, can
repetitions again. glycogen wasn't restored three minutes, obviously
there. - Right. - realized might mechanisms involved. Sounds like
heat is, not dominant mechanism prevents work. one them. -
one them. quick one. fast one. can happen with, say
really experienced weightlifter, okay? may very, high weights
sets five six. - Yeah, clear audience, not high weights
sets five. [chuckles] [Craig laughs] not particularly strong. not super weak,
not particularly strong, Craig's referring, general sense, you.
finish set squats, can't simply cool off quadriceps throwing nice
cool towel quadriceps. not best way go it? -
body surface good insulator. Okay, think don't fur,
therefore not insulated, skin, fascia, muscles underneath,
good insulators. said earlier way heat gets
muscle blood. - want step couple portals one
might think heating cooling ideal. get back these. - Sure.

00:22:10 Cooling Off: Methods Counterproductive

- Specialized surfaces hands, feet face. - [Craig] Yeah. -
throwing cold towel even ice cold towel quadriceps isn't going work
standing front fan, insulated cool, can't cool off blood
fast enough. drinking 16 ounces ice water? - Sure. can that.
can calculate much heat can absorb, okay? can't continue
drinking liters ice water. going dilute blood problems.
yes, it'll help. Sure, will help. doesn't full capacity will need. -
ice pack back neck head squeezing cold
sponge head? deliberately moving options,
ones see often. actually just watching Olympic track
field trials last night Oregon. huge track field fan.
lot sponges backs necks before, between, events.


good poor strategy? Since now know overheated
locally systemically throughout body serious limiting factor performance. -
Well, understand something thermoregulatory system.
thermostat just like thermostat house. thermostat
brain, okay? - know specific site? - Yes. - Yes. - called preoptic interior
hypothalamus. many things terms physiological regulation, serves
thermostat. Now thermostat information. input.
input come from? comes overall body surface sense
temperature, okay? one things can happen overheated
can send cold stimulus thermostat sort like wanting cool
house putting wet washcloth thermostat, wrong thing.
actually experiences people exercising, getting
overheated, cooling body surface, say feels great.
fantastic. core temperature going up. - Well, think important
point. First all, weaned laboratory always battles
temperature lab. people always putting ice packs thermostats
putting fans towards thermostats trying play game. Good know
foolish, even though neurobiologists. Putting cold towel torso
putting ice back upper back, saying actually heat
core? - It'll least decrease heat loss, rate heat loss going
raise issue little later, know, natural portals heat loss.
can think natural portals heat loss air conditioners, okay?
thermostats brain information thermostat coming overall
body surface. can happen you, say, cool torso ice vest,
can actually cause vasoconstriction portals, heat loss portals.
impairs rate losing heat. feels good. Now back head,
really interesting. major blood flow brain comes four arteries
neck. carotid arteries vertebral arteries. put
cold towel around neck, going putting cold stimulus brain.
great protecting brain. want protect brain, also going
make feel cooler are. will think ready go quickly
just essentially cooled thermostat. - important point.
lot interest nowadays, people marathons, even people
ultras, ultra running, guess everything longer marathon.


last man standing, last man, last woman standing kind things. saying
somebody's hyperthermic, trick subjectively thinking
cooling off putting towel can go further, brain cook?
- Well, stop cooling,

00:26:43 Exercise-Induced Brain Fog

hot blood body core going go brain. - Interesting, well,
bit tangent, many people report long bouts exercise, even just
intense bouts exercise, feeling kind brain fog mental fatigue. assumed
due lowered brain oxygenation post-exercise, possible
post-exercise effects heating cooling brain might impact
cognition, say negatively impact cognition? - certainly possible
know rise temperature decreases cognitive capacity. mean, can
experience yourself. can get treadmill, follow temperature,
just simple activity like adding subtracting. get 39 degrees,
can't anymore. can't just calculate long
treadmill. - phrase cool, calm collected is- - Cool, calm collected. -
goal

00:27:45 Hyperthermia

pursuits. - right. - want talk portals,
mentioned times. ask portals exactly
work can leveraged performance, question
neurobiologist self can't resist, ask. thermostat preoptic area
hypothalamus, interesting me, medial preoptic area also one
known sexually dimorphic, depending testosterone exposure early life, et
cetera. Although people just note not actually testosterone creates
sexual dimorphism, differences. Actually testosterone converted
estrogen. actually estrogen effector, fascinating. Nonetheless,
got area acts thermostat. said collecting information
whole body. mean pathways, neuroscientists like
refer them, afferent input pathways body preoptic area,


map body preoptic area? 'Cause imagine can't
information just coming left shoulder, just right toe. sounds
like need pretty, probably pretty crude map, need complete map
body surface there. - Well, don't need complete map hypothalamus.
mean, thermal afferent information mentioned, also goes
somatosensory cortex. know ice cube touched back,
doesn't necessarily translate change in, say shivering sweating.
information going hypothalamus integrated representation
body temperature. - sort average happening- - average. -
Across body. to, say get hot hot day Popsicles,
summer camp, went sports camp near actually, run around
like crazy. get shade could, were, Popsicles.
Popsicles. - Brain freeze. - kids putting ice cubes
other's shirts something. average, parts body aren't
exposed, mouth exposed ice Popsicle case cold cubes
hands. said, feels really good. - feels good. Yeah. - sounds like
feels deceptively good, reality still quite warm internally. -
Absolutely. Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah. can feel great dangerously
hyperthermic temperature, say get danger zone,
things get bad fast. - symptoms people
lookout hyperthermia? - Essentially, almost ironic individuals
transitioning heat stroke, actually vasoconstrict stop sweating.
pathological situation. couldn't begin explain it. essentially just
feeling exhausted. feeling miserable. heart rate high. heart rate
goes core temperature goes up, called cardiac drift. just feel rotten.
since not danger signal can translate immediately into, oop,
going heat stroke, people can overcome bad feeling
motivation continue going, work harder. there've number high profile
athletic deaths due heat stroke practice. Not competition
people really trying it,

00:31:50 Best Body Sites Cooling: Palms, Foot Pads, Upper Face

practice, shows just motivated push. - talk


magnificent portals not just humans, animals, mammals equipped with.
putting cold neck head torso not optimal,
optimal? maybe walk us theory portals
located are. can talk one might leverage
performance. - Okay, portals are, glabrous skin, big word, okay?
Glabrous just means no hair. hairless skin. say, well, body
without hair. No, body hair follicles. mammals, mammals
fur. lost fur, still hairy skin phenotype body,
except, except skin surfaces mammal relatives didn't fur.
pads feet. primates, upper part face. rabbits, no portions
ears, inner surfaces ears- - Ah, never thought that. bears,
tongue. Bears big tongues, huge tongues. [chuckles] - didn't know either.
haven't close bear yet. - Haven't leaking match bear. - Not
yet. No. - anyway, mammalian relatives can't lose heat overall body
surface. probably early mammalian evolution, evolved special
blood vessels limited surface areas don't fur. said,
blood vessels shunts arteries veins. Arteries veins
low resistance vessels. can high flow rate. Capillaries, normally
arteries veins high resistance tiny, okay? -
fair say taught blood flows arteries, capillaries,
veins, back heart. sort like heart
arteries, little capillaries, like little estuaries streams
veins, back heart. generally true? - Yeah, absolutely. -
Okay, learned basic physiology still? - still- - wouldn't get F
class? - No. - Maybe D C, not F. - excellent. - Okay.
saying glabrous beneath glabrous skin. - shunts. -
go directly arteries veins? skip capillaries- - Capillaries, yep. -
actually, long I'm, say skin, feel pads hands,
deep surface vessels reside? - the, obviously
epidermis. warm look palms hands, fairly
red backs hands aren't. don't vessels backs
hands. Now take glass, like water tumbler, right? grab it, can
see squeeze little bit, hand goes white. shut off
blood flow. - Oh, interesting. going little home experiment. -


bicycling hot day, don't want grabbing handlebars time.
want periodically. [chuckles] - Well, important. know privy really
amazing results going talk about, actually heard say
lecture recently Stanford held human performance part
of. mentioned this, cycling working hard want
able work, now know want remain cool order
continue work, get warm, bad, gripping handlebars
tightly will actually limit performance. - Right. - probably also true
Peloton kind device skier anything like that. - Right. - loosen
grip, safely can, want actually expose hands world? Now
people wearing gloves? the, just seems crazy
based everything telling me. - Well, gloves definitely impede heat loss
hands, just socks impede heat loss feet, okay? want maximize
heat loss, want thinner protectors possible hands.
course feet problematical, using certain
ways. - people run barefoot. - Yeah. Well, yeah. - Yeah. become somewhat
popular. seems like kind came went. toe shoes things,
looked ridiculous think people just willing take
performance hindrance regular shoes. - Actually track coach
Stanford famous introducing training without shoes, running. -
Interesting. - thought changed posture runner.
think just due fact increasing capacity runners lose
heat. - Interesting, yeah, heating level hands obviously going
hinder performance. running? noticed, ran cross country briefly
high school, not particularly well that, told run
holding crackers fingers something like lightly, keep hands kind
loose. running like actually beneficial performance than,
gripping phone, probably people nowadays, right? -
Right. - Interesting and- - Once, tell experience once. Alaska
winter went running absentmindedly forgot gloves.

00:38:00 Cooling Brain via Upper Face; Concussion

realized short period running, backs hands


aching cold, palms hands sweating hot. - Oh,
amazing. Amazing. compartments real thing. mentioned
upper half face- - upper part, primate ancestors don't
fur. - bottoms feet. just take moment talk
amazing results associated proper cooling glabrous
skin surfaces. - Let introduce one thing. - Sure. - asked earlier
pouring water head, okay? One things not
appreciated fully blood perfusing special blood vessels
face beard line, non-hairy skin, blood returns venous
supply heart, actually strange way. actually goes
called, blocking name now. - Take time. - blood
vessels go skull, okay? scalp bleeds lot cut
scalp. blood vessels called, want say emergent, not
emergent. word means leaving. blood vessels primarily thought
ways blood leaving brain. overheated, direction flow
blood vessels reverses. cool blood coming facial region
goes circulation actually cooling source brain. can cool
brain. can cooling effect brain pouring water head. -
Interesting, practice, we, least me, commonly associate
combat sports, fighter goes corner. usually sit stool,
unless trying mental warfare corner, case,
don't even take seat. corner crew will squeeze glove, excuse me, sponge
full cold water them, saying somewhat effective cooling
brain? - Yeah, one natural mechanisms cooling brain. - want return
point well, known benefit cooling brain terms
offsetting physical damage, offsetting negative effects concussion.
one reasons fighters will often get, back, cold item back
neck head not just cool down, theory might offset
damage neurons. - just can't comment that. aware ideas,
controversial. One things want injury brain
decrease swelling. one ways decrease swelling many parts
body cool. decreases inflammation. decreases blood flow. think
really interesting topic



00:41:25 Extraordinary (Tripling!) Performance Cooling Palms

something investigated. kind hard investigate. - Yeah,
interesting. Okay. hear stories. seen data. believe
stories. Maybe tell us story observation group made
respect anaerobic exercise proper cooling glabrous surfaces.
can talk technology. Maybe give us dips example first. - Okay. -
course, think people familiar dips. supposed to, guess- - Raise
lower body. - Yeah, raise lower body, raise lower body mass
usually legs dangling down. Sometimes people strong enough attach
weight do, essentially compound upper body exercise. - Right. -
One dip not particularly impressive people. 100
impressive. 20 impressive some, et cetera. happens skilled
athlete comes dips multiple sets. happens cool
properly using glabrous skin surface? - story occurred early
investigations first made discoveries cooling benefit increase
work volume, capacity reps, okay? word got over, think,
49ers camp. one players, Greg Clark, tight end time.
tight end Stanford. decided, don't know asked, what,
come check out. Greg came said, "Greg,
good at? activity like do?" said, "Dips. can lot dips. can
40 dips first set. can probably five sets. usual workout me."
said okay. came gym one day exactly did.
40 dips first set, maybe 25 15 down, down- - recall
roughly kind rest periods taking sets? - Yeah, standardized
rest period three minutes, set cooling
injure- - good long rest period. - Yeah. is. - still lot dips. - Yeah,
actually longer rest period many people prefer workouts. want
make time- - Not me. prefer take much rest possibly can,
yeah. - several days later came back first set, did, think, maybe 42,
little bit better, now people standing around watching. little
impetus show off. second set was, don't remember numbers,
much second set control day. cooled his- -
Okay, cooling? - sitting putting hands


devices built, cooling palms hands. - long
cooling take? Can inside three-minute rest period? - Yeah,
doing. standardized interval resting cooling three minutes,
okay. point got fifth set sets
done previous day. said, "I'm not tired. can another set."
can another set. can another set. can another set. one day two
three days later cooling, doubled total work volume. doubled total
number dips. - adding sets repetitions set? - Right,
kept coming back four weeks, twice week. end month,
300 dips. - Wow. percent- - tripled. - tripled. - Tripled,
professional athlete

00:45:35 Enhancing Recovery, Eliminating Soreness w/Intra-workout Cooling

peak physical conditioning, triples can do. - Amazing, terms
ability recover, explored discussed all? understanding
cause enough stress muscle anaerobic training, provide
stimulus compensatory regrowth, et cetera, work, essentially
scale amount recovery needed recovery time. curious
whether not needed longer recover super-performing
workouts? - interesting. major discovery, didn't realize
making time. phenomenon referring delayed
onset muscle soreness, DOMS. due little micro tares, forth,
happening extend workout capacity volume, okay?
experience many times athlete anyone will come lab will
exceed previous goals were, previous expectations. can always
see words coming mouth, "I'm going sore tomorrow." never
are. - Interesting. - actually demonstrated naive group.
class, physical conditioning class. half the, first days class,
establish true capacity, do. pretty heavy
workouts new recruits. gave half benefit cooling
half not. record subjective levels delayed onset
muscle soreness. cool, didn't significant muscle soreness. -
Amazing, know also published results, will provide links


papers people seeing similar effects, say, similar performance
enhancing effects, using bench presses, bench press, pushups, sorts
things. Maybe give us example realm endurance work
aerobic work, running, cycling, things sort. - Well, one problems with,
us, equipment now not really portable. mean, portable sense
can carry gym football field. - not going run run
it. - not going run it, right. - equip bicycle it. Although
cooling handles bicycles coming? - good, one itinerant
activity golfing. people put golf carts, and- - people really heat
much golf? - do. - Not disparaging golfers, way
conceptualize golf, like swing walk cart ride meal.
probably just offended golfers there. - Well, one time work
Department Defense. wanted check out, whether not
really worthwhile. sent team special ops soldiers
subjects test out. week. fun week. -
Yeah, work guys. hard driving guys. also know
fun. yeah, definitely have, off quit switch, buried
deep within nervous system. don't like hit quit switch. - guy
wrote final report, gave addendum report said, "Well, tell
this. gotten home, added technology," took technology
them. wanted keep it. - Oh, Yeah. sounds right. - using it,
added 20 yards every club bag. no effin' small deal. - Wow,
allowing people hit further, hit golf ball further? - Right. [chuckles] - Interesting.
right. golf players there, reward get back Craig
little knocks golf.

00:50:00 Multiple Sclerosis: Heat Sensitivity & Amelioration Cooling

don't knock golf. just don't think sport heating
limiting factor. since getting drive, think's going
there? - Well, can heating up. - wear gloves, right? -
wearing glove hot day, forth. let just tell one serious story
golfers individuals multiple sclerosis exceedingly temperature-
sensitive. - didn't know that. - may still mobile, stay cool


locations not increase exercise great extent. subjects
multiple sclerosis just essentially put device golf cart
back playing golf middle summer. - Oh, great. - Yeah. -
great. Anything allows people normal levels livelihood recreation
great. always think performance kinds like peak elite levels
pushing harder, yeah,

00:51:00 Enhancing Endurance Proper Cooling

anything allows people mobile functional great. favorite
example endurance, feel free give us extreme one talk
averages make sure thorough averages versus exceptions. - Right.
haven't done lot field. mean outdoors. endurance hot
room treadmill work, forth. first experiment had, think,
maybe 18 subjects just off street. Maybe just recruited people hallways,
come this. found could, group one trial
without cooling, double endurance, walking treadmill, walking
uphill treadmill heat, like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature, 40
degrees centigrade. - experiment look like? people walk
incline. really warm. people just going hit quit button say,
enough get off treadmill proper cooling.
cooling? - continuously. - see. - laboratory, can
suspend devices ceiling, example. Now prototype wearable
devices. response emails Ebola workers number years ago
Sierra Leone. said, "We've read work athletes. Can't
something us? mean, personal protective gear, can't
hot zone 15 20 minutes." started us challenge
developing wearable systems go PPE. published work
now, but-. - great, guessing military special operators
desert locations probably excited technology. - Well,
get it. - get. coming, coming. Yeah, think people might
wonder, studies

00:53:00 Cool Mitt, Ice-Cold Cold, 3 Minutes Cooling



incredible results years haven't heard
it? will ask opinion well. just editorialize little bit.
best laboratory work practical applications oftentimes requires many
studies. oftentimes isn't portal, speak, get information
technology sector. company developing technology
people use, purchase use. might well just tell us now, name
company? website? People going want know
can get magical technology? poor man's version well? -
Well, company Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A, website www.coolmitt.com.
CoolMitt just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com - great website. went there,
says right now, technology available professional sports teams
military. true? - Well, stand now new version technology
sort beta test versions. got hands people used
technology before. NFL teams using. college teams.
Olympics. Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball, NBA, National
Tennis Association. locations now trying reporting
back, working? change it? improve it?
forth. are. website, can actually sign one
will able get one [chuckles] finally manufactured. now
made fairly small lots, want change things realize
can improved. - Yeah. Stanford all. want get technology right.
like joke one reasons like Stanford much that, not
colleagues amazing forward thinking, perfectionists.
perfectionist mindset perfect can go live,
speak. Well, think will lot interest. talk technology little
detail moment. talk whether not cruder forms
technology exist either sake safety and/or performance. is, CoolMitt,
understand mitt, glove. put hand into, hold
surface. surface cools hand thereby specialized portal,
cools core body temperature muscles body. Subjectively,
right now, think ice cold think just cool? -
Just cool. - see. - Ice cold cold. people always ask, well, can't just
stick hand bucket ice water? cold. causes


reflex, vasoconstriction portals trying maximize heat loss
from. stick hand cold water, comes out, cold. - just
sealed heat body. - Yeah. Right, sort recommended
someone one point, said, "Well, running, can't just carry frozen juice
can, will gradually melt?" said, "Well, no, going decrease
heat loss hand. every couple minutes switched hands, [chuckles]
might work. - Well, feeling people now well
trying this. long, CoolMitt proper temperature, long people
putting hands Mitt? - We, again, just standardized three
minutes. part reason rate heat loss exponentially
declining curve, okay? three minutes sort gets best part curve.
can go longer get benefit, biggest bang buck first two,
three minutes. - Okay, mentioned number impressive organizations, sports
teams, military using this. not something typically see
sidelines games. Although honest, haven't looked carefully. guessing
probably keeping technology somewhat wraps. Where,
this? running back locker room? mean, military
special operators thing, terms athletes, possible,
hypothetically, athletes somewhat incognito? - possible, really
don't know. People mentioned Stanford, don't see football team
using it. Well, football team Stanford mostly playing cold weather, cool
weather. night games cool. Even day games not hot frequently here.

use it. - Interesting, poor person's, poor man woman's version
this? mentioned juice can passing back forth. mentioned cooling
hands. number people said learning little bit science
technology experienced big effects, positive effects cooling by,
confess, done this, taking package frozen blueberries, just kind passing
back forth hands. Now talking you, realize probably didn't
long enough. probably was, maybe 30 seconds passing back


forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

long time coming. know many people lot questions
use cold. one things happened recent years
many reasons, people become interested things like taking cold showers
taking ice baths many different purposes. Sometimes introduced just

so-called benefit, wouldn't call benefit, cryo chambers. go
cryo chamber shock. get shot adrenaline. So, sure. going
feel different come out. shot adrenaline. doesn't
necessarily translate benefit terms physiology performance,
forth. Now take cold bath cold shower, couple things happening.
One going stimulate vasoconstriction. anything, going make
little bit difficult body get rid heat, shutting off
avenues heat loss. true cold bath, overall surface area body
great doesn't matter vasoconstricted, still going lose heat. -
Okay, vasoconstriction, constriction of, capillaries, vessels arteries


constrict just one two? - Well, area controversy. general,
people talk vasoconstriction, talk overall skin surface, not true.
primary sites heat loss, going get into, palms
hands, soles feet, upper part face. reason
avenues heat loss underlain special blood vessels. blood
vessels able shunt blood arteries, coming heart,
directly veins, returning heart, bypassing capillaries,
nutritive vessels, high resistance. can tell shake
someone's hand thermal status is. hand's hot cold. -
think part reason humans evolved practice shaking hands?
[Craig chuckles] Assessing other's level anxiety? know limp shake
pretty indicative something firm handshake indicatives something,
crushing handshake matter, right? - Yeah, really don't know
evolutionary origin handshaking is, get hand away
weapon, [chuckles] perhaps. - Right, couple questions get
specialized vascular compartments soles, palms upper face.
mentioned whole body immersion, like ice bath cold water neck
versus cold shower. something fundamentally different two,
besides fact provide release adrenaline? anything
really important

00:10:45 Boundary Layers

understand difference physiological response evoked cold shower
versus immersion cold? - Well, differences physical
anything else. cold bath still, develop boundary layer.
shower, can't develop boundary layer. - explain
boundary layer is? - Yes, best explain terms hot bath, 'cause everybody's
experienced that. get hot bath and, oh God, really hot, almost painful.
sit eventually doesn't feel hot anymore, still
water, close skin, coming equilibrium skin. like
blanket insulator you. move around, disturb
still water layer. feel hot temperature again. - see, get
cold ice bath cold body water kind stay still, likely feel warmer


least I- - not going losing much heat. - see. - Right. -
move in- - flail around, flail around, going lose
heat.

00:11:55 Cooling Aerobic Activity Enhance Performance

- Got it. - Yeah. think getting back original question benefits,
keep mind whether talking aerobic activity anaerobic activity,
referring performance exercise, forth. aerobic
activity can sustain long time, production heat rising gradually
distributed throughout body. eventually body temperature
going come level going impair performance. benefit
cold bath cold shower aerobic activity increase capacity
body mass absorb excess heat. - see, say that, rough
sense, protocol one might use going head long run? -
Yep. - Even reasonably warm day, not super hot, maybe super hot,
take cool shower go run. beneficial? - Sure, it'll take
longer get sweat point heat up. - will translate terms
performance benefit? - Well, increase speed, depends
use benefit. people pacers. will go pace
will go farther. people are, going say pacers regulators and, no, no.
Pacers forcers. will take advantage use fast can.
will go faster, not necessarily farther. - see, far know, not many
athletes, least not ones know, getting cool bodies water, taking
cold showers head train. sounds like real
performance benefit there. - benefit. know going talk
technology cooling, one point our, don't know using now,
cross-country team, go compete hot place,
warm-up exercises, stretching. extract heat
beginning race. like think greater scope heat
absorption. - Interesting, long one need take one showers
cold immersions heading run? Roughly speaking, don't get
details, everyone's performance level regimen going different,
live going different, et cetera. - not long think.


minutes. - Couple minutes? - Yeah. going happen core
temperature goes down, will eventually shut off heat loss. keeps
going normal. warmed temperature

00:14:45 Anaerobic Activity Locally Increases Muscle Heat

risen half degree, say, doesn't take minutes extract
heat vasodilated. - Interesting, anaerobic athlete?
strength athlete. - Right. anaerobic athlete, say
several sets many reps, whatever doing, core temperature's not
going rise fast, certain muscles used,
temperature muscles will go up. - local effect. - local effect, right. -
Okay. say, sake today, maybe discussion, assume
basic workout, even though people variation 5 sets 5 10 sets 10.
listening, 5 sets 10 5 rep repetitions, 10 sets 10
repetitions, 10 10, 5 5. Yeah, somebody, say, large body
compound movement, like barbell squats lot large body
movements, hip hinging, et cetera. instance, biceps not, involved,
less indirectly. - Right. - effect going heat
quadriceps, heat hamstrings, heat glutes, kind thing. - Right. - see.
- rest, heat will leave muscle, not fast. certainly
heat can't leave muscle fast working out, muscle
contracts, squeezes blood vessels. way heat gets muscle
blood. muscle metabolism can go 50 60-fold anaerobic
activity. means heat production muscle goes 50 60-fold. blood
flow muscle cannot go 50 60-fold. literally capacity cook
muscles. [Craig chuckles]

00:16:45 Temperature Gates Energy Use

- probably appropriate time just mention briefly underlying
mechanism is. will return specifics one can mitigate
heating up, just explain relationship energy production ATP
pyruvate kinase role heat there? - Sure. don't get something


nothing. like steam engine, energy food lost heat.
roughly 20% efficient. energy take food, 20%
can go work, rest lost heat. Now mammals.
use heat keep body temperature considerably environment.
raise body temperature degrees higher, trouble, hyperthermia.
individual muscles can reach hyperthermic limits might experience
whole body. keep damaging muscle hyperthermia,
fail-safe mechanisms. one fail-safe mechanisms enzyme
critical getting fuel. words, results metabolism glucose, getting
fuel mitochondria, making major coinage energy exchange, ATP,
okay? particular enzyme temperature-sensitive. muscle
temperature gets 39 39.5, shuts off. essentially shuts off fuel
supply mitochondria. cannot one rep. - failure,
say that- - Muscle failure. - One component muscular failure overheating
muscle locally? - Right. - There're probably things too. - Well, you, yeah,
lack oxygen, oxygen delivery pretty good muscle. run
glucose, yeah. going impair you. immediate, immediate
impairment muscle activity, muscle fatigue, words,

00:19:00 Local Versus Systemic Fatigue: Heat Fail

rise temperature muscle. - Interesting, want talk
muscle fails locally, burning question mind cannot seem
answer myself. hoping can answer me. say five sets
five squats. hit fit muscular failure given weight. according now
know, quadriceps muscles associated, mean, squat
failed heat triggering, mechanism triggered heat shuts off
muscle. biceps nice cool, telling me. not much
work. indirect work. can't set bar squat rack,
walk barbell curls intensity
barbell curls fresh, not done anything prior? - Well, will still fatigue
curve upper body, okay? will influenced rise temperature
generated lower body exercise. - temperature cases
limiting factor? - one limiting factor. one limiting factor. - find amazing.


find amazing always thought naively reason muscles fail
because, quote, don't strength another repetition. lack glycogen
ability access glycogen. course, still glycogen. naive
think that, wait three minutes go back, can
repetitions again. glycogen wasn't restored three minutes, obviously
there. - Right. - realized might mechanisms involved. Sounds like
heat is, not dominant mechanism prevents work. one them. -
one them. quick one. fast one. can happen with, say
really experienced weightlifter, okay? may very, high weights
sets five six. - Yeah, clear audience, not high weights
sets five. [chuckles] [Craig laughs] not particularly strong. not super weak,
not particularly strong, Craig's referring, general sense, you.
finish set squats, can't simply cool off quadriceps throwing nice
cool towel quadriceps. not best way go it? -
body surface good insulator. Okay, think don't fur,
therefore not insulated, skin, fascia, muscles underneath,
good insulators. said earlier way heat gets
muscle blood. - want step couple portals one
might think heating cooling ideal. get back these. - Sure.

00:22:10 Cooling Off: Methods Counterproductive

- Specialized surfaces hands, feet face. - [Craig] Yeah. -
throwing cold towel even ice cold towel quadriceps isn't going work
standing front fan, insulated cool, can't cool off blood
fast enough. drinking 16 ounces ice water? - Sure. can that.
can calculate much heat can absorb, okay? can't continue
drinking liters ice water. going dilute blood problems.
yes, it'll help. Sure, will help. doesn't full capacity will need. -
ice pack back neck head squeezing cold
sponge head? deliberately moving options,
ones see often. actually just watching Olympic track
field trials last night Oregon. huge track field fan.
lot sponges backs necks before, between, events.


good poor strategy? Since now know overheated
locally systemically throughout body serious limiting factor performance. -
Well, understand something thermoregulatory system.
thermostat just like thermostat house. thermostat
brain, okay? - know specific site? - Yes. - Yes. - called preoptic interior
hypothalamus. many things terms physiological regulation, serves
thermostat. Now thermostat information. input.
input come from? comes overall body surface sense
temperature, okay? one things can happen overheated
can send cold stimulus thermostat sort like wanting cool
house putting wet washcloth thermostat, wrong thing.
actually experiences people exercising, getting
overheated, cooling body surface, say feels great.
fantastic. core temperature going up. - Well, think important
point. First all, weaned laboratory always battles
temperature lab. people always putting ice packs thermostats
putting fans towards thermostats trying play game. Good know
foolish, even though neurobiologists. Putting cold towel torso
putting ice back upper back, saying actually heat
core? - It'll least decrease heat loss, rate heat loss going
raise issue little later, know, natural portals heat loss.
can think natural portals heat loss air conditioners, okay?
thermostats brain information thermostat coming overall
body surface. can happen you, say, cool torso ice vest,
can actually cause vasoconstriction portals, heat loss portals.
impairs rate losing heat. feels good. Now back head,
really interesting. major blood flow brain comes four arteries
neck. carotid arteries vertebral arteries. put
cold towel around neck, going putting cold stimulus brain.
great protecting brain. want protect brain, also going
make feel cooler are. will think ready go quickly
just essentially cooled thermostat. - important point.
lot interest nowadays, people marathons, even people
ultras, ultra running, guess everything longer marathon.


last man standing, last man, last woman standing kind things. saying
somebody's hyperthermic, trick subjectively thinking
cooling off putting towel can go further, brain cook?
- Well, stop cooling,

00:26:43 Exercise-Induced Brain Fog

hot blood body core going go brain. - Interesting, well,
bit tangent, many people report long bouts exercise, even just
intense bouts exercise, feeling kind brain fog mental fatigue. assumed
due lowered brain oxygenation post-exercise, possible
post-exercise effects heating cooling brain might impact
cognition, say negatively impact cognition? - certainly possible
know rise temperature decreases cognitive capacity. mean, can
experience yourself. can get treadmill, follow temperature,
just simple activity like adding subtracting. get 39 degrees,
can't anymore. can't just calculate long
treadmill. - phrase cool, calm collected is- - Cool, calm collected. -
goal

00:27:45 Hyperthermia

pursuits. - right. - want talk portals,
mentioned times. ask portals exactly
work can leveraged performance, question
neurobiologist self can't resist, ask. thermostat preoptic area
hypothalamus, interesting me, medial preoptic area also one
known sexually dimorphic, depending testosterone exposure early life, et
cetera. Although people just note not actually testosterone creates
sexual dimorphism, differences. Actually testosterone converted
estrogen. actually estrogen effector, fascinating. Nonetheless,
got area acts thermostat. said collecting information
whole body. mean pathways, neuroscientists like
refer them, afferent input pathways body preoptic area,


map body preoptic area? 'Cause imagine can't
information just coming left shoulder, just right toe. sounds
like need pretty, probably pretty crude map, need complete map
body surface there. - Well, don't need complete map hypothalamus.
mean, thermal afferent information mentioned, also goes
somatosensory cortex. know ice cube touched back,
doesn't necessarily translate change in, say shivering sweating.
information going hypothalamus integrated representation
body temperature. - sort average happening- - average. -
Across body. to, say get hot hot day Popsicles,
summer camp, went sports camp near actually, run around
like crazy. get shade could, were, Popsicles.
Popsicles. - Brain freeze. - kids putting ice cubes
other's shirts something. average, parts body aren't
exposed, mouth exposed ice Popsicle case cold cubes
hands. said, feels really good. - feels good. Yeah. - sounds like
feels deceptively good, reality still quite warm internally. -
Absolutely. Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah. can feel great dangerously
hyperthermic temperature, say get danger zone,
things get bad fast. - symptoms people
lookout hyperthermia? - Essentially, almost ironic individuals
transitioning heat stroke, actually vasoconstrict stop sweating.
pathological situation. couldn't begin explain it. essentially just
feeling exhausted. feeling miserable. heart rate high. heart rate
goes core temperature goes up, called cardiac drift. just feel rotten.
since not danger signal can translate immediately into, oop,
going heat stroke, people can overcome bad feeling
motivation continue going, work harder. there've number high profile
athletic deaths due heat stroke practice. Not competition
people really trying it,

00:31:50 Best Body Sites Cooling: Palms, Foot Pads, Upper Face

practice, shows just motivated push. - talk


magnificent portals not just humans, animals, mammals equipped with.
putting cold neck head torso not optimal,
optimal? maybe walk us theory portals
located are. can talk one might leverage
performance. - Okay, portals are, glabrous skin, big word, okay?
Glabrous just means no hair. hairless skin. say, well, body
without hair. No, body hair follicles. mammals, mammals
fur. lost fur, still hairy skin phenotype body,
except, except skin surfaces mammal relatives didn't fur.
pads feet. primates, upper part face. rabbits, no portions
ears, inner surfaces ears- - Ah, never thought that. bears,
tongue. Bears big tongues, huge tongues. [chuckles] - didn't know either.
haven't close bear yet. - Haven't leaking match bear. - Not
yet. No. - anyway, mammalian relatives can't lose heat overall body
surface. probably early mammalian evolution, evolved special
blood vessels limited surface areas don't fur. said,
blood vessels shunts arteries veins. Arteries veins
low resistance vessels. can high flow rate. Capillaries, normally
arteries veins high resistance tiny, okay? -
fair say taught blood flows arteries, capillaries,
veins, back heart. sort like heart
arteries, little capillaries, like little estuaries streams
veins, back heart. generally true? - Yeah, absolutely. -
Okay, learned basic physiology still? - still- - wouldn't get F
class? - No. - Maybe D C, not F. - excellent. - Okay.
saying glabrous beneath glabrous skin. - shunts. -
go directly arteries veins? skip capillaries- - Capillaries, yep. -
actually, long I'm, say skin, feel pads hands,
deep surface vessels reside? - the, obviously
epidermis. warm look palms hands, fairly
red backs hands aren't. don't vessels backs
hands. Now take glass, like water tumbler, right? grab it, can
see squeeze little bit, hand goes white. shut off
blood flow. - Oh, interesting. going little home experiment. -


bicycling hot day, don't want grabbing handlebars time.
want periodically. [chuckles] - Well, important. know privy really
amazing results going talk about, actually heard say
lecture recently Stanford held human performance part
of. mentioned this, cycling working hard want
able work, now know want remain cool order
continue work, get warm, bad, gripping handlebars
tightly will actually limit performance. - Right. - probably also true
Peloton kind device skier anything like that. - Right. - loosen
grip, safely can, want actually expose hands world? Now
people wearing gloves? the, just seems crazy
based everything telling me. - Well, gloves definitely impede heat loss
hands, just socks impede heat loss feet, okay? want maximize
heat loss, want thinner protectors possible hands.
course feet problematical, using certain
ways. - people run barefoot. - Yeah. Well, yeah. - Yeah. become somewhat
popular. seems like kind came went. toe shoes things,
looked ridiculous think people just willing take
performance hindrance regular shoes. - Actually track coach
Stanford famous introducing training without shoes, running. -
Interesting. - thought changed posture runner.
think just due fact increasing capacity runners lose
heat. - Interesting, yeah, heating level hands obviously going
hinder performance. running? noticed, ran cross country briefly
high school, not particularly well that, told run
holding crackers fingers something like lightly, keep hands kind
loose. running like actually beneficial performance than,
gripping phone, probably people nowadays, right? -
Right. - Interesting and- - Once, tell experience once. Alaska
winter went running absentmindedly forgot gloves.

00:38:00 Cooling Brain via Upper Face; Concussion

realized short period running, backs hands


aching cold, palms hands sweating hot. - Oh,
amazing. Amazing. compartments real thing. mentioned
upper half face- - upper part, primate ancestors don't
fur. - bottoms feet. just take moment talk
amazing results associated proper cooling glabrous
skin surfaces. - Let introduce one thing. - Sure. - asked earlier
pouring water head, okay? One things not
appreciated fully blood perfusing special blood vessels
face beard line, non-hairy skin, blood returns venous
supply heart, actually strange way. actually goes
called, blocking name now. - Take time. - blood
vessels go skull, okay? scalp bleeds lot cut
scalp. blood vessels called, want say emergent, not
emergent. word means leaving. blood vessels primarily thought
ways blood leaving brain. overheated, direction flow
blood vessels reverses. cool blood coming facial region
goes circulation actually cooling source brain. can cool
brain. can cooling effect brain pouring water head. -
Interesting, practice, we, least me, commonly associate
combat sports, fighter goes corner. usually sit stool,
unless trying mental warfare corner, case,
don't even take seat. corner crew will squeeze glove, excuse me, sponge
full cold water them, saying somewhat effective cooling
brain? - Yeah, one natural mechanisms cooling brain. - want return
point well, known benefit cooling brain terms
offsetting physical damage, offsetting negative effects concussion.
one reasons fighters will often get, back, cold item back
neck head not just cool down, theory might offset
damage neurons. - just can't comment that. aware ideas,
controversial. One things want injury brain
decrease swelling. one ways decrease swelling many parts
body cool. decreases inflammation. decreases blood flow. think
really interesting topic



00:41:25 Extraordinary (Tripling!) Performance Cooling Palms

something investigated. kind hard investigate. - Yeah,
interesting. Okay. hear stories. seen data. believe
stories. Maybe tell us story observation group made
respect anaerobic exercise proper cooling glabrous surfaces.
can talk technology. Maybe give us dips example first. - Okay. -
course, think people familiar dips. supposed to, guess- - Raise
lower body. - Yeah, raise lower body, raise lower body mass
usually legs dangling down. Sometimes people strong enough attach
weight do, essentially compound upper body exercise. - Right. -
One dip not particularly impressive people. 100
impressive. 20 impressive some, et cetera. happens skilled
athlete comes dips multiple sets. happens cool
properly using glabrous skin surface? - story occurred early
investigations first made discoveries cooling benefit increase
work volume, capacity reps, okay? word got over, think,
49ers camp. one players, Greg Clark, tight end time.
tight end Stanford. decided, don't know asked, what,
come check out. Greg came said, "Greg,
good at? activity like do?" said, "Dips. can lot dips. can
40 dips first set. can probably five sets. usual workout me."
said okay. came gym one day exactly did.
40 dips first set, maybe 25 15 down, down- - recall
roughly kind rest periods taking sets? - Yeah, standardized
rest period three minutes, set cooling
injure- - good long rest period. - Yeah. is. - still lot dips. - Yeah,
actually longer rest period many people prefer workouts. want
make time- - Not me. prefer take much rest possibly can,
yeah. - several days later came back first set, did, think, maybe 42,
little bit better, now people standing around watching. little
impetus show off. second set was, don't remember numbers,
much second set control day. cooled his- -
Okay, cooling? - sitting putting hands


devices built, cooling palms hands. - long
cooling take? Can inside three-minute rest period? - Yeah,
doing. standardized interval resting cooling three minutes,
okay. point got fifth set sets
done previous day. said, "I'm not tired. can another set."
can another set. can another set. can another set. one day two
three days later cooling, doubled total work volume. doubled total
number dips. - adding sets repetitions set? - Right,
kept coming back four weeks, twice week. end month,
300 dips. - Wow. percent- - tripled. - tripled. - Tripled,
professional athlete

00:45:35 Enhancing Recovery, Eliminating Soreness w/Intra-workout Cooling

peak physical conditioning, triples can do. - Amazing, terms
ability recover, explored discussed all? understanding
cause enough stress muscle anaerobic training, provide
stimulus compensatory regrowth, et cetera, work, essentially
scale amount recovery needed recovery time. curious
whether not needed longer recover super-performing
workouts? - interesting. major discovery, didn't realize
making time. phenomenon referring delayed
onset muscle soreness, DOMS. due little micro tares, forth,
happening extend workout capacity volume, okay?
experience many times athlete anyone will come lab will
exceed previous goals were, previous expectations. can always
see words coming mouth, "I'm going sore tomorrow." never
are. - Interesting. - actually demonstrated naive group.
class, physical conditioning class. half the, first days class,
establish true capacity, do. pretty heavy
workouts new recruits. gave half benefit cooling
half not. record subjective levels delayed onset
muscle soreness. cool, didn't significant muscle soreness. -
Amazing, know also published results, will provide links


papers people seeing similar effects, say, similar performance
enhancing effects, using bench presses, bench press, pushups, sorts
things. Maybe give us example realm endurance work
aerobic work, running, cycling, things sort. - Well, one problems with,
us, equipment now not really portable. mean, portable sense
can carry gym football field. - not going run run
it. - not going run it, right. - equip bicycle it. Although
cooling handles bicycles coming? - good, one itinerant
activity golfing. people put golf carts, and- - people really heat
much golf? - do. - Not disparaging golfers, way
conceptualize golf, like swing walk cart ride meal.
probably just offended golfers there. - Well, one time work
Department Defense. wanted check out, whether not
really worthwhile. sent team special ops soldiers
subjects test out. week. fun week. -
Yeah, work guys. hard driving guys. also know
fun. yeah, definitely have, off quit switch, buried
deep within nervous system. don't like hit quit switch. - guy
wrote final report, gave addendum report said, "Well, tell
this. gotten home, added technology," took technology
them. wanted keep it. - Oh, Yeah. sounds right. - using it,
added 20 yards every club bag. no effin' small deal. - Wow,
allowing people hit further, hit golf ball further? - Right. [chuckles] - Interesting.
right. golf players there, reward get back Craig
little knocks golf.

00:50:00 Multiple Sclerosis: Heat Sensitivity & Amelioration Cooling

don't knock golf. just don't think sport heating
limiting factor. since getting drive, think's going
there? - Well, can heating up. - wear gloves, right? -
wearing glove hot day, forth. let just tell one serious story
golfers individuals multiple sclerosis exceedingly temperature-
sensitive. - didn't know that. - may still mobile, stay cool


locations not increase exercise great extent. subjects
multiple sclerosis just essentially put device golf cart
back playing golf middle summer. - Oh, great. - Yeah. -
great. Anything allows people normal levels livelihood recreation
great. always think performance kinds like peak elite levels
pushing harder, yeah,

00:51:00 Enhancing Endurance Proper Cooling

anything allows people mobile functional great. favorite
example endurance, feel free give us extreme one talk
averages make sure thorough averages versus exceptions. - Right.
haven't done lot field. mean outdoors. endurance hot
room treadmill work, forth. first experiment had, think,
maybe 18 subjects just off street. Maybe just recruited people hallways,
come this. found could, group one trial
without cooling, double endurance, walking treadmill, walking
uphill treadmill heat, like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature, 40
degrees centigrade. - experiment look like? people walk
incline. really warm. people just going hit quit button say,
enough get off treadmill proper cooling.
cooling? - continuously. - see. - laboratory, can
suspend devices ceiling, example. Now prototype wearable
devices. response emails Ebola workers number years ago
Sierra Leone. said, "We've read work athletes. Can't
something us? mean, personal protective gear, can't
hot zone 15 20 minutes." started us challenge
developing wearable systems go PPE. published work
now, but-. - great, guessing military special operators
desert locations probably excited technology. - Well,
get it. - get. coming, coming. Yeah, think people might
wonder, studies

00:53:00 Cool Mitt, Ice-Cold Cold, 3 Minutes Cooling



incredible results years haven't heard
it? will ask opinion well. just editorialize little bit.
best laboratory work practical applications oftentimes requires many
studies. oftentimes isn't portal, speak, get information
technology sector. company developing technology
people use, purchase use. might well just tell us now, name
company? website? People going want know
can get magical technology? poor man's version well? -
Well, company Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A, website www.coolmitt.com.
CoolMitt just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com - great website. went there,
says right now, technology available professional sports teams
military. true? - Well, stand now new version technology
sort beta test versions. got hands people used
technology before. NFL teams using. college teams.
Olympics. Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball, NBA, National
Tennis Association. locations now trying reporting
back, working? change it? improve it?
forth. are. website, can actually sign one
will able get one [chuckles] finally manufactured. now
made fairly small lots, want change things realize
can improved. - Yeah. Stanford all. want get technology right.
like joke one reasons like Stanford much that, not
colleagues amazing forward thinking, perfectionists.
perfectionist mindset perfect can go live,
speak. Well, think will lot interest. talk technology little
detail moment. talk whether not cruder forms
technology exist either sake safety and/or performance. is, CoolMitt,
understand mitt, glove. put hand into, hold
surface. surface cools hand thereby specialized portal,
cools core body temperature muscles body. Subjectively,
right now, think ice cold think just cool? -
Just cool. - see. - Ice cold cold. people always ask, well, can't just
stick hand bucket ice water? cold. causes


reflex, vasoconstriction portals trying maximize heat loss
from. stick hand cold water, comes out, cold. - just
sealed heat body. - Yeah. Right, sort recommended
someone one point, said, "Well, running, can't just carry frozen juice
can, will gradually melt?" said, "Well, no, going decrease
heat loss hand. every couple minutes switched hands, [chuckles]
might work. - Well, feeling people now well
trying this. long, CoolMitt proper temperature, long people
putting hands Mitt? - We, again, just standardized three
minutes. part reason rate heat loss exponentially
declining curve, okay? three minutes sort gets best part curve.
can go longer get benefit, biggest bang buck first two,
three minutes. - Okay, mentioned number impressive organizations, sports
teams, military using this. not something typically see
sidelines games. Although honest, haven't looked carefully. guessing
probably keeping technology somewhat wraps. Where,
this? running back locker room? mean, military
special operators thing, terms athletes, possible,
hypothetically, athletes somewhat incognito? - possible, really
don't know. People mentioned Stanford, don't see football team
using it. Well, football team Stanford mostly playing cold weather, cool
weather. night games cool. Even day games not hot frequently here.
go hot place like Arizona Utah, least coach,

00:58:20 Can Use Palmer Cooling Enhance Performance

Shaw, says take find benefit.
use it. - Interesting, poor person's, poor man woman's version
this? mentioned juice can passing back forth. mentioned cooling
hands. number people said learning little bit science
technology experienced big effects, positive effects cooling by,
confess, done this, taking package frozen blueberries, just kind passing
back forth hands. Now talking you, realize probably didn't
long enough. probably was, maybe 30 seconds passing back


forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

constrict just one two? - Well, area controversy. general,
people talk vasoconstriction, talk overall skin surface, not true.
primary sites heat loss, going get into, palms
hands, soles feet, upper part face. reason
avenues heat loss underlain special blood vessels. blood
vessels able shunt blood arteries, coming heart,
directly veins, returning heart, bypassing capillaries,
nutritive vessels, high resistance. can tell shake
someone's hand thermal status is. hand's hot cold. -
think part reason humans evolved practice shaking hands?
[Craig chuckles] Assessing other's level anxiety? know limp shake
pretty indicative something firm handshake indicatives something,
crushing handshake matter, right? - Yeah, really don't know
evolutionary origin handshaking is, get hand away
weapon, [chuckles] perhaps. - Right, couple questions get
specialized vascular compartments soles, palms upper face.
mentioned whole body immersion, like ice bath cold water neck
versus cold shower. something fundamentally different two,
besides fact provide release adrenaline? anything
really important

00:10:45 Boundary Layers

understand difference physiological response evoked cold shower
versus immersion cold? - Well, differences physical
anything else. cold bath still, develop boundary layer.
shower, can't develop boundary layer. - explain
boundary layer is? - Yes, best explain terms hot bath, 'cause everybody's
experienced that. get hot bath and, oh God, really hot, almost painful.
sit eventually doesn't feel hot anymore, still
water, close skin, coming equilibrium skin. like
blanket insulator you. move around, disturb
still water layer. feel hot temperature again. - see, get
cold ice bath cold body water kind stay still, likely feel warmer


least I- - not going losing much heat. - see. - Right. -
move in- - flail around, flail around, going lose
heat.

00:11:55 Cooling Aerobic Activity Enhance Performance

- Got it. - Yeah. think getting back original question benefits,
keep mind whether talking aerobic activity anaerobic activity,
referring performance exercise, forth. aerobic
activity can sustain long time, production heat rising gradually
distributed throughout body. eventually body temperature
going come level going impair performance. benefit
cold bath cold shower aerobic activity increase capacity
body mass absorb excess heat. - see, say that, rough
sense, protocol one might use going head long run? -
Yep. - Even reasonably warm day, not super hot, maybe super hot,
take cool shower go run. beneficial? - Sure, it'll take
longer get sweat point heat up. - will translate terms
performance benefit? - Well, increase speed, depends
use benefit. people pacers. will go pace
will go farther. people are, going say pacers regulators and, no, no.
Pacers forcers. will take advantage use fast can.
will go faster, not necessarily farther. - see, far know, not many
athletes, least not ones know, getting cool bodies water, taking
cold showers head train. sounds like real
performance benefit there. - benefit. know going talk
technology cooling, one point our, don't know using now,
cross-country team, go compete hot place,
warm-up exercises, stretching. extract heat
beginning race. like think greater scope heat
absorption. - Interesting, long one need take one showers
cold immersions heading run? Roughly speaking, don't get
details, everyone's performance level regimen going different,
live going different, et cetera. - not long think.


minutes. - Couple minutes? - Yeah. going happen core
temperature goes down, will eventually shut off heat loss. keeps
going normal. warmed temperature

00:14:45 Anaerobic Activity Locally Increases Muscle Heat

risen half degree, say, doesn't take minutes extract
heat vasodilated. - Interesting, anaerobic athlete?
strength athlete. - Right. anaerobic athlete, say
several sets many reps, whatever doing, core temperature's not
going rise fast, certain muscles used,
temperature muscles will go up. - local effect. - local effect, right. -
Okay. say, sake today, maybe discussion, assume
basic workout, even though people variation 5 sets 5 10 sets 10.
listening, 5 sets 10 5 rep repetitions, 10 sets 10
repetitions, 10 10, 5 5. Yeah, somebody, say, large body
compound movement, like barbell squats lot large body
movements, hip hinging, et cetera. instance, biceps not, involved,
less indirectly. - Right. - effect going heat
quadriceps, heat hamstrings, heat glutes, kind thing. - Right. - see.
- rest, heat will leave muscle, not fast. certainly
heat can't leave muscle fast working out, muscle
contracts, squeezes blood vessels. way heat gets muscle
blood. muscle metabolism can go 50 60-fold anaerobic
activity. means heat production muscle goes 50 60-fold. blood
flow muscle cannot go 50 60-fold. literally capacity cook
muscles. [Craig chuckles]

00:16:45 Temperature Gates Energy Use

- probably appropriate time just mention briefly underlying
mechanism is. will return specifics one can mitigate
heating up, just explain relationship energy production ATP
pyruvate kinase role heat there? - Sure. don't get something


nothing. like steam engine, energy food lost heat.
roughly 20% efficient. energy take food, 20%
can go work, rest lost heat. Now mammals.
use heat keep body temperature considerably environment.
raise body temperature degrees higher, trouble, hyperthermia.
individual muscles can reach hyperthermic limits might experience
whole body. keep damaging muscle hyperthermia,
fail-safe mechanisms. one fail-safe mechanisms enzyme
critical getting fuel. words, results metabolism glucose, getting
fuel mitochondria, making major coinage energy exchange, ATP,
okay? particular enzyme temperature-sensitive. muscle
temperature gets 39 39.5, shuts off. essentially shuts off fuel
supply mitochondria. cannot one rep. - failure,
say that- - Muscle failure. - One component muscular failure overheating
muscle locally? - Right. - There're probably things too. - Well, you, yeah,
lack oxygen, oxygen delivery pretty good muscle. run
glucose, yeah. going impair you. immediate, immediate
impairment muscle activity, muscle fatigue, words,

00:19:00 Local Versus Systemic Fatigue: Heat Fail

rise temperature muscle. - Interesting, want talk
muscle fails locally, burning question mind cannot seem
answer myself. hoping can answer me. say five sets
five squats. hit fit muscular failure given weight. according now
know, quadriceps muscles associated, mean, squat
failed heat triggering, mechanism triggered heat shuts off
muscle. biceps nice cool, telling me. not much
work. indirect work. can't set bar squat rack,
walk barbell curls intensity
barbell curls fresh, not done anything prior? - Well, will still fatigue
curve upper body, okay? will influenced rise temperature
generated lower body exercise. - temperature cases
limiting factor? - one limiting factor. one limiting factor. - find amazing.


find amazing always thought naively reason muscles fail
because, quote, don't strength another repetition. lack glycogen
ability access glycogen. course, still glycogen. naive
think that, wait three minutes go back, can
repetitions again. glycogen wasn't restored three minutes, obviously
there. - Right. - realized might mechanisms involved. Sounds like
heat is, not dominant mechanism prevents work. one them. -
one them. quick one. fast one. can happen with, say
really experienced weightlifter, okay? may very, high weights
sets five six. - Yeah, clear audience, not high weights
sets five. [chuckles] [Craig laughs] not particularly strong. not super weak,
not particularly strong, Craig's referring, general sense, you.
finish set squats, can't simply cool off quadriceps throwing nice
cool towel quadriceps. not best way go it? -
body surface good insulator. Okay, think don't fur,
therefore not insulated, skin, fascia, muscles underneath,
good insulators. said earlier way heat gets
muscle blood. - want step couple portals one
might think heating cooling ideal. get back these. - Sure.

00:22:10 Cooling Off: Methods Counterproductive

- Specialized surfaces hands, feet face. - [Craig] Yeah. -
throwing cold towel even ice cold towel quadriceps isn't going work
standing front fan, insulated cool, can't cool off blood
fast enough. drinking 16 ounces ice water? - Sure. can that.
can calculate much heat can absorb, okay? can't continue
drinking liters ice water. going dilute blood problems.
yes, it'll help. Sure, will help. doesn't full capacity will need. -
ice pack back neck head squeezing cold
sponge head? deliberately moving options,
ones see often. actually just watching Olympic track
field trials last night Oregon. huge track field fan.
lot sponges backs necks before, between, events.


good poor strategy? Since now know overheated
locally systemically throughout body serious limiting factor performance. -
Well, understand something thermoregulatory system.
thermostat just like thermostat house. thermostat
brain, okay? - know specific site? - Yes. - Yes. - called preoptic interior
hypothalamus. many things terms physiological regulation, serves
thermostat. Now thermostat information. input.
input come from? comes overall body surface sense
temperature, okay? one things can happen overheated
can send cold stimulus thermostat sort like wanting cool
house putting wet washcloth thermostat, wrong thing.
actually experiences people exercising, getting
overheated, cooling body surface, say feels great.
fantastic. core temperature going up. - Well, think important
point. First all, weaned laboratory always battles
temperature lab. people always putting ice packs thermostats
putting fans towards thermostats trying play game. Good know
foolish, even though neurobiologists. Putting cold towel torso
putting ice back upper back, saying actually heat
core? - It'll least decrease heat loss, rate heat loss going
raise issue little later, know, natural portals heat loss.
can think natural portals heat loss air conditioners, okay?
thermostats brain information thermostat coming overall
body surface. can happen you, say, cool torso ice vest,
can actually cause vasoconstriction portals, heat loss portals.
impairs rate losing heat. feels good. Now back head,
really interesting. major blood flow brain comes four arteries
neck. carotid arteries vertebral arteries. put
cold towel around neck, going putting cold stimulus brain.
great protecting brain. want protect brain, also going
make feel cooler are. will think ready go quickly
just essentially cooled thermostat. - important point.
lot interest nowadays, people marathons, even people
ultras, ultra running, guess everything longer marathon.


last man standing, last man, last woman standing kind things. saying
somebody's hyperthermic, trick subjectively thinking
cooling off putting towel can go further, brain cook?
- Well, stop cooling,

00:26:43 Exercise-Induced Brain Fog

hot blood body core going go brain. - Interesting, well,
bit tangent, many people report long bouts exercise, even just
intense bouts exercise, feeling kind brain fog mental fatigue. assumed
due lowered brain oxygenation post-exercise, possible
post-exercise effects heating cooling brain might impact
cognition, say negatively impact cognition? - certainly possible
know rise temperature decreases cognitive capacity. mean, can
experience yourself. can get treadmill, follow temperature,
just simple activity like adding subtracting. get 39 degrees,
can't anymore. can't just calculate long
treadmill. - phrase cool, calm collected is- - Cool, calm collected. -
goal

00:27:45 Hyperthermia

pursuits. - right. - want talk portals,
mentioned times. ask portals exactly
work can leveraged performance, question
neurobiologist self can't resist, ask. thermostat preoptic area
hypothalamus, interesting me, medial preoptic area also one
known sexually dimorphic, depending testosterone exposure early life, et
cetera. Although people just note not actually testosterone creates
sexual dimorphism, differences. Actually testosterone converted
estrogen. actually estrogen effector, fascinating. Nonetheless,
got area acts thermostat. said collecting information
whole body. mean pathways, neuroscientists like
refer them, afferent input pathways body preoptic area,


map body preoptic area? 'Cause imagine can't
information just coming left shoulder, just right toe. sounds
like need pretty, probably pretty crude map, need complete map
body surface there. - Well, don't need complete map hypothalamus.
mean, thermal afferent information mentioned, also goes
somatosensory cortex. know ice cube touched back,
doesn't necessarily translate change in, say shivering sweating.
information going hypothalamus integrated representation
body temperature. - sort average happening- - average. -
Across body. to, say get hot hot day Popsicles,
summer camp, went sports camp near actually, run around
like crazy. get shade could, were, Popsicles.
Popsicles. - Brain freeze. - kids putting ice cubes
other's shirts something. average, parts body aren't
exposed, mouth exposed ice Popsicle case cold cubes
hands. said, feels really good. - feels good. Yeah. - sounds like
feels deceptively good, reality still quite warm internally. -
Absolutely. Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah. can feel great dangerously
hyperthermic temperature, say get danger zone,
things get bad fast. - symptoms people
lookout hyperthermia? - Essentially, almost ironic individuals
transitioning heat stroke, actually vasoconstrict stop sweating.
pathological situation. couldn't begin explain it. essentially just
feeling exhausted. feeling miserable. heart rate high. heart rate
goes core temperature goes up, called cardiac drift. just feel rotten.
since not danger signal can translate immediately into, oop,
going heat stroke, people can overcome bad feeling
motivation continue going, work harder. there've number high profile
athletic deaths due heat stroke practice. Not competition
people really trying it,

00:31:50 Best Body Sites Cooling: Palms, Foot Pads, Upper Face

practice, shows just motivated push. - talk


magnificent portals not just humans, animals, mammals equipped with.
putting cold neck head torso not optimal,
optimal? maybe walk us theory portals
located are. can talk one might leverage
performance. - Okay, portals are, glabrous skin, big word, okay?
Glabrous just means no hair. hairless skin. say, well, body
without hair. No, body hair follicles. mammals, mammals
fur. lost fur, still hairy skin phenotype body,
except, except skin surfaces mammal relatives didn't fur.
pads feet. primates, upper part face. rabbits, no portions
ears, inner surfaces ears- - Ah, never thought that. bears,
tongue. Bears big tongues, huge tongues. [chuckles] - didn't know either.
haven't close bear yet. - Haven't leaking match bear. - Not
yet. No. - anyway, mammalian relatives can't lose heat overall body
surface. probably early mammalian evolution, evolved special
blood vessels limited surface areas don't fur. said,
blood vessels shunts arteries veins. Arteries veins
low resistance vessels. can high flow rate. Capillaries, normally
arteries veins high resistance tiny, okay? -
fair say taught blood flows arteries, capillaries,
veins, back heart. sort like heart
arteries, little capillaries, like little estuaries streams
veins, back heart. generally true? - Yeah, absolutely. -
Okay, learned basic physiology still? - still- - wouldn't get F
class? - No. - Maybe D C, not F. - excellent. - Okay.
saying glabrous beneath glabrous skin. - shunts. -
go directly arteries veins? skip capillaries- - Capillaries, yep. -
actually, long I'm, say skin, feel pads hands,
deep surface vessels reside? - the, obviously
epidermis. warm look palms hands, fairly
red backs hands aren't. don't vessels backs
hands. Now take glass, like water tumbler, right? grab it, can
see squeeze little bit, hand goes white. shut off
blood flow. - Oh, interesting. going little home experiment. -


bicycling hot day, don't want grabbing handlebars time.
want periodically. [chuckles] - Well, important. know privy really
amazing results going talk about, actually heard say
lecture recently Stanford held human performance part
of. mentioned this, cycling working hard want
able work, now know want remain cool order
continue work, get warm, bad, gripping handlebars
tightly will actually limit performance. - Right. - probably also true
Peloton kind device skier anything like that. - Right. - loosen
grip, safely can, want actually expose hands world? Now
people wearing gloves? the, just seems crazy
based everything telling me. - Well, gloves definitely impede heat loss
hands, just socks impede heat loss feet, okay? want maximize
heat loss, want thinner protectors possible hands.
course feet problematical, using certain
ways. - people run barefoot. - Yeah. Well, yeah. - Yeah. become somewhat
popular. seems like kind came went. toe shoes things,
looked ridiculous think people just willing take
performance hindrance regular shoes. - Actually track coach
Stanford famous introducing training without shoes, running. -
Interesting. - thought changed posture runner.
think just due fact increasing capacity runners lose
heat. - Interesting, yeah, heating level hands obviously going
hinder performance. running? noticed, ran cross country briefly
high school, not particularly well that, told run
holding crackers fingers something like lightly, keep hands kind
loose. running like actually beneficial performance than,
gripping phone, probably people nowadays, right? -
Right. - Interesting and- - Once, tell experience once. Alaska
winter went running absentmindedly forgot gloves.

00:38:00 Cooling Brain via Upper Face; Concussion

realized short period running, backs hands


aching cold, palms hands sweating hot. - Oh,
amazing. Amazing. compartments real thing. mentioned
upper half face- - upper part, primate ancestors don't
fur. - bottoms feet. just take moment talk
amazing results associated proper cooling glabrous
skin surfaces. - Let introduce one thing. - Sure. - asked earlier
pouring water head, okay? One things not
appreciated fully blood perfusing special blood vessels
face beard line, non-hairy skin, blood returns venous
supply heart, actually strange way. actually goes
called, blocking name now. - Take time. - blood
vessels go skull, okay? scalp bleeds lot cut
scalp. blood vessels called, want say emergent, not
emergent. word means leaving. blood vessels primarily thought
ways blood leaving brain. overheated, direction flow
blood vessels reverses. cool blood coming facial region
goes circulation actually cooling source brain. can cool
brain. can cooling effect brain pouring water head. -
Interesting, practice, we, least me, commonly associate
combat sports, fighter goes corner. usually sit stool,
unless trying mental warfare corner, case,
don't even take seat. corner crew will squeeze glove, excuse me, sponge
full cold water them, saying somewhat effective cooling
brain? - Yeah, one natural mechanisms cooling brain. - want return
point well, known benefit cooling brain terms
offsetting physical damage, offsetting negative effects concussion.
one reasons fighters will often get, back, cold item back
neck head not just cool down, theory might offset
damage neurons. - just can't comment that. aware ideas,
controversial. One things want injury brain
decrease swelling. one ways decrease swelling many parts
body cool. decreases inflammation. decreases blood flow. think
really interesting topic



00:41:25 Extraordinary (Tripling!) Performance Cooling Palms

something investigated. kind hard investigate. - Yeah,
interesting. Okay. hear stories. seen data. believe
stories. Maybe tell us story observation group made
respect anaerobic exercise proper cooling glabrous surfaces.
can talk technology. Maybe give us dips example first. - Okay. -
course, think people familiar dips. supposed to, guess- - Raise
lower body. - Yeah, raise lower body, raise lower body mass
usually legs dangling down. Sometimes people strong enough attach
weight do, essentially compound upper body exercise. - Right. -
One dip not particularly impressive people. 100
impressive. 20 impressive some, et cetera. happens skilled
athlete comes dips multiple sets. happens cool
properly using glabrous skin surface? - story occurred early
investigations first made discoveries cooling benefit increase
work volume, capacity reps, okay? word got over, think,
49ers camp. one players, Greg Clark, tight end time.
tight end Stanford. decided, don't know asked, what,
come check out. Greg came said, "Greg,
good at? activity like do?" said, "Dips. can lot dips. can
40 dips first set. can probably five sets. usual workout me."
said okay. came gym one day exactly did.
40 dips first set, maybe 25 15 down, down- - recall
roughly kind rest periods taking sets? - Yeah, standardized
rest period three minutes, set cooling
injure- - good long rest period. - Yeah. is. - still lot dips. - Yeah,
actually longer rest period many people prefer workouts. want
make time- - Not me. prefer take much rest possibly can,
yeah. - several days later came back first set, did, think, maybe 42,
little bit better, now people standing around watching. little
impetus show off. second set was, don't remember numbers,
much second set control day. cooled his- -
Okay, cooling? - sitting putting hands


devices built, cooling palms hands. - long
cooling take? Can inside three-minute rest period? - Yeah,
doing. standardized interval resting cooling three minutes,
okay. point got fifth set sets
done previous day. said, "I'm not tired. can another set."
can another set. can another set. can another set. one day two
three days later cooling, doubled total work volume. doubled total
number dips. - adding sets repetitions set? - Right,
kept coming back four weeks, twice week. end month,
300 dips. - Wow. percent- - tripled. - tripled. - Tripled,
professional athlete

00:45:35 Enhancing Recovery, Eliminating Soreness w/Intra-workout Cooling

peak physical conditioning, triples can do. - Amazing, terms
ability recover, explored discussed all? understanding
cause enough stress muscle anaerobic training, provide
stimulus compensatory regrowth, et cetera, work, essentially
scale amount recovery needed recovery time. curious
whether not needed longer recover super-performing
workouts? - interesting. major discovery, didn't realize
making time. phenomenon referring delayed

happening extend workout capacity volume, okay?
experience many times athlete anyone will come lab will
exceed previous goals were, previous expectations. can always
see words coming mouth, "I'm going sore tomorrow." never
are. - Interesting. - actually demonstrated naive group.
class, physical conditioning class. half the, first days class,
establish true capacity, do. pretty heavy
workouts new recruits. gave half benefit cooling
half not. record subjective levels delayed onset
muscle soreness. cool, didn't significant muscle soreness. -
Amazing, know also published results, will provide links


papers people seeing similar effects, say, similar performance
enhancing effects, using bench presses, bench press, pushups, sorts
things. Maybe give us example realm endurance work
aerobic work, running, cycling, things sort. - Well, one problems with,
us, equipment now not really portable. mean, portable sense
can carry gym football field. - not going run run
it. - not going run it, right. - equip bicycle it. Although
cooling handles bicycles coming? - good, one itinerant
activity golfing. people put golf carts, and- - people really heat
much golf? - do. - Not disparaging golfers, way
conceptualize golf, like swing walk cart ride meal.
probably just offended golfers there. - Well, one time work
Department Defense. wanted check out, whether not
really worthwhile. sent team special ops soldiers
subjects test out. week. fun week. -
Yeah, work guys. hard driving guys. also know
fun. yeah, definitely have, off quit switch, buried
deep within nervous system. don't like hit quit switch. - guy
wrote final report, gave addendum report said, "Well, tell
this. gotten home, added technology," took technology
them. wanted keep it. - Oh, Yeah. sounds right. - using it,
added 20 yards every club bag. no effin' small deal. - Wow,
allowing people hit further, hit golf ball further? - Right. [chuckles] - Interesting.
right. golf players there, reward get back Craig
little knocks golf.

00:50:00 Multiple Sclerosis: Heat Sensitivity & Amelioration Cooling

don't knock golf. just don't think sport heating
limiting factor. since getting drive, think's going
there? - Well, can heating up. - wear gloves, right? -
wearing glove hot day, forth. let just tell one serious story
golfers individuals multiple sclerosis exceedingly temperature-
sensitive. - didn't know that. - may still mobile, stay cool


locations not increase exercise great extent. subjects
multiple sclerosis just essentially put device golf cart
back playing golf middle summer. - Oh, great. - Yeah. -
great. Anything allows people normal levels livelihood recreation
great. always think performance kinds like peak elite levels
pushing harder, yeah,

00:51:00 Enhancing Endurance Proper Cooling

anything allows people mobile functional great. favorite
example endurance, feel free give us extreme one talk
averages make sure thorough averages versus exceptions. - Right.
haven't done lot field. mean outdoors. endurance hot
room treadmill work, forth. first experiment had, think,
maybe 18 subjects just off street. Maybe just recruited people hallways,
come this. found could, group one trial
without cooling, double endurance, walking treadmill, walking
uphill treadmill heat, like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature, 40
degrees centigrade. - experiment look like? people walk
incline. really warm. people just going hit quit button say,
enough get off treadmill proper cooling.
cooling? - continuously. - see. - laboratory, can
suspend devices ceiling, example. Now prototype wearable

developing wearable systems go PPE. published work
now, but-. - great, guessing military special operators
desert locations probably excited technology. - Well,
get it. - get. coming, coming. Yeah, think people might
wonder, studies

00:53:00 Cool Mitt, Ice-Cold Cold, 3 Minutes Cooling



incredible results years haven't heard
it? will ask opinion well. just editorialize little bit.
best laboratory work practical applications oftentimes requires many
studies. oftentimes isn't portal, speak, get information
technology sector. company developing technology
people use, purchase use. might well just tell us now, name
company? website? People going want know
can get magical technology? poor man's version well? -
Well, company Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A, website www.coolmitt.com.
CoolMitt just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com - great website. went there,
says right now, technology available professional sports teams
military. true? - Well, stand now new version technology
sort beta test versions. got hands people used
technology before. NFL teams using. college teams.
Olympics. Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball, NBA, National
Tennis Association. locations now trying reporting
back, working? change it? improve it?
forth. are. website, can actually sign one
will able get one [chuckles] finally manufactured. now
made fairly small lots, want change things realize
can improved. - Yeah. Stanford all. want get technology right.
like joke one reasons like Stanford much that, not
colleagues amazing forward thinking, perfectionists.
perfectionist mindset perfect can go live,
speak. Well, think will lot interest. talk technology little
detail moment. talk whether not cruder forms
technology exist either sake safety and/or performance. is, CoolMitt,
understand mitt, glove. put hand into, hold
surface. surface cools hand thereby specialized portal,
cools core body temperature muscles body. Subjectively,
right now, think ice cold think just cool? -
Just cool. - see. - Ice cold cold. people always ask, well, can't just
stick hand bucket ice water? cold. causes


reflex, vasoconstriction portals trying maximize heat loss
from. stick hand cold water, comes out, cold. - just
sealed heat body. - Yeah. Right, sort recommended
someone one point, said, "Well, running, can't just carry frozen juice
can, will gradually melt?" said, "Well, no, going decrease
heat loss hand. every couple minutes switched hands, [chuckles]
might work. - Well, feeling people now well
trying this. long, CoolMitt proper temperature, long people
putting hands Mitt? - We, again, just standardized three
minutes. part reason rate heat loss exponentially
declining curve, okay? three minutes sort gets best part curve.
can go longer get benefit, biggest bang buck first two,
three minutes. - Okay, mentioned number impressive organizations, sports
teams, military using this. not something typically see
sidelines games. Although honest, haven't looked carefully. guessing
probably keeping technology somewhat wraps. Where,
this? running back locker room? mean, military
special operators thing, terms athletes, possible,
hypothetically, athletes somewhat incognito? - possible, really
don't know. People mentioned Stanford, don't see football team
using it. Well, football team Stanford mostly playing cold weather, cool
weather. night games cool. Even day games not hot frequently here.
go hot place like Arizona Utah, least coach,

00:58:20 Can Use Palmer Cooling Enhance Performance

Shaw, says take find benefit.
use it. - Interesting, poor person's, poor man woman's version
this? mentioned juice can passing back forth. mentioned cooling
hands. number people said learning little bit science
technology experienced big effects, positive effects cooling by,
confess, done this, taking package frozen blueberries, just kind passing
back forth hands. Now talking you, realize probably didn't
long enough. probably was, maybe 30 seconds passing back


forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

least I- - not going losing much heat. - see. - Right. -
move in- - flail around, flail around, going lose
heat.

00:11:55 Cooling Aerobic Activity Enhance Performance

- Got it. - Yeah. think getting back original question benefits,
keep mind whether talking aerobic activity anaerobic activity,
referring performance exercise, forth. aerobic
activity can sustain long time, production heat rising gradually
distributed throughout body. eventually body temperature
going come level going impair performance. benefit
cold bath cold shower aerobic activity increase capacity
body mass absorb excess heat. - see, say that, rough
sense, protocol one might use going head long run? -
Yep. - Even reasonably warm day, not super hot, maybe super hot,
take cool shower go run. beneficial? - Sure, it'll take
longer get sweat point heat up. - will translate terms
performance benefit? - Well, increase speed, depends
use benefit. people pacers. will go pace
will go farther. people are, going say pacers regulators and, no, no.
Pacers forcers. will take advantage use fast can.
will go faster, not necessarily farther. - see, far know, not many
athletes, least not ones know, getting cool bodies water, taking
cold showers head train. sounds like real
performance benefit there. - benefit. know going talk
technology cooling, one point our, don't know using now,
cross-country team, go compete hot place,
warm-up exercises, stretching. extract heat
beginning race. like think greater scope heat
absorption. - Interesting, long one need take one showers
cold immersions heading run? Roughly speaking, don't get
details, everyone's performance level regimen going different,
live going different, et cetera. - not long think.


minutes. - Couple minutes? - Yeah. going happen core
temperature goes down, will eventually shut off heat loss. keeps
going normal. warmed temperature

00:14:45 Anaerobic Activity Locally Increases Muscle Heat

risen half degree, say, doesn't take minutes extract
heat vasodilated. - Interesting, anaerobic athlete?
strength athlete. - Right. anaerobic athlete, say
several sets many reps, whatever doing, core temperature's not
going rise fast, certain muscles used,
temperature muscles will go up. - local effect. - local effect, right. -
Okay. say, sake today, maybe discussion, assume
basic workout, even though people variation 5 sets 5 10 sets 10.
listening, 5 sets 10 5 rep repetitions, 10 sets 10
repetitions, 10 10, 5 5. Yeah, somebody, say, large body
compound movement, like barbell squats lot large body
movements, hip hinging, et cetera. instance, biceps not, involved,
less indirectly. - Right. - effect going heat
quadriceps, heat hamstrings, heat glutes, kind thing. - Right. - see.
- rest, heat will leave muscle, not fast. certainly
heat can't leave muscle fast working out, muscle
contracts, squeezes blood vessels. way heat gets muscle
blood. muscle metabolism can go 50 60-fold anaerobic
activity. means heat production muscle goes 50 60-fold. blood
flow muscle cannot go 50 60-fold. literally capacity cook
muscles. [Craig chuckles]

00:16:45 Temperature Gates Energy Use

- probably appropriate time just mention briefly underlying
mechanism is. will return specifics one can mitigate
heating up, just explain relationship energy production ATP
pyruvate kinase role heat there? - Sure. don't get something


nothing. like steam engine, energy food lost heat.
roughly 20% efficient. energy take food, 20%
can go work, rest lost heat. Now mammals.
use heat keep body temperature considerably environment.
raise body temperature degrees higher, trouble, hyperthermia.
individual muscles can reach hyperthermic limits might experience
whole body. keep damaging muscle hyperthermia,
fail-safe mechanisms. one fail-safe mechanisms enzyme
critical getting fuel. words, results metabolism glucose, getting
fuel mitochondria, making major coinage energy exchange, ATP,
okay? particular enzyme temperature-sensitive. muscle
temperature gets 39 39.5, shuts off. essentially shuts off fuel
supply mitochondria. cannot one rep. - failure,
say that- - Muscle failure. - One component muscular failure overheating
muscle locally? - Right. - There're probably things too. - Well, you, yeah,
lack oxygen, oxygen delivery pretty good muscle. run
glucose, yeah. going impair you. immediate, immediate
impairment muscle activity, muscle fatigue, words,

00:19:00 Local Versus Systemic Fatigue: Heat Fail

rise temperature muscle. - Interesting, want talk
muscle fails locally, burning question mind cannot seem
answer myself. hoping can answer me. say five sets
five squats. hit fit muscular failure given weight. according now
know, quadriceps muscles associated, mean, squat
failed heat triggering, mechanism triggered heat shuts off
muscle. biceps nice cool, telling me. not much
work. indirect work. can't set bar squat rack,
walk barbell curls intensity
barbell curls fresh, not done anything prior? - Well, will still fatigue
curve upper body, okay? will influenced rise temperature
generated lower body exercise. - temperature cases
limiting factor? - one limiting factor. one limiting factor. - find amazing.


find amazing always thought naively reason muscles fail
because, quote, don't strength another repetition. lack glycogen
ability access glycogen. course, still glycogen. naive
think that, wait three minutes go back, can
repetitions again. glycogen wasn't restored three minutes, obviously
there. - Right. - realized might mechanisms involved. Sounds like
heat is, not dominant mechanism prevents work. one them. -
one them. quick one. fast one. can happen with, say
really experienced weightlifter, okay? may very, high weights
sets five six. - Yeah, clear audience, not high weights
sets five. [chuckles] [Craig laughs] not particularly strong. not super weak,
not particularly strong, Craig's referring, general sense, you.
finish set squats, can't simply cool off quadriceps throwing nice
cool towel quadriceps. not best way go it? -
body surface good insulator. Okay, think don't fur,
therefore not insulated, skin, fascia, muscles underneath,
good insulators. said earlier way heat gets
muscle blood. - want step couple portals one
might think heating cooling ideal. get back these. - Sure.

00:22:10 Cooling Off: Methods Counterproductive

- Specialized surfaces hands, feet face. - [Craig] Yeah. -
throwing cold towel even ice cold towel quadriceps isn't going work
standing front fan, insulated cool, can't cool off blood
fast enough. drinking 16 ounces ice water? - Sure. can that.
can calculate much heat can absorb, okay? can't continue
drinking liters ice water. going dilute blood problems.
yes, it'll help. Sure, will help. doesn't full capacity will need. -
ice pack back neck head squeezing cold
sponge head? deliberately moving options,
ones see often. actually just watching Olympic track
field trials last night Oregon. huge track field fan.
lot sponges backs necks before, between, events.


good poor strategy? Since now know overheated
locally systemically throughout body serious limiting factor performance. -
Well, understand something thermoregulatory system.
thermostat just like thermostat house. thermostat
brain, okay? - know specific site? - Yes. - Yes. - called preoptic interior
hypothalamus. many things terms physiological regulation, serves
thermostat. Now thermostat information. input.
input come from? comes overall body surface sense
temperature, okay? one things can happen overheated
can send cold stimulus thermostat sort like wanting cool
house putting wet washcloth thermostat, wrong thing.
actually experiences people exercising, getting
overheated, cooling body surface, say feels great.
fantastic. core temperature going up. - Well, think important
point. First all, weaned laboratory always battles
temperature lab. people always putting ice packs thermostats
putting fans towards thermostats trying play game. Good know
foolish, even though neurobiologists. Putting cold towel torso
putting ice back upper back, saying actually heat
core? - It'll least decrease heat loss, rate heat loss going
raise issue little later, know, natural portals heat loss.
can think natural portals heat loss air conditioners, okay?
thermostats brain information thermostat coming overall
body surface. can happen you, say, cool torso ice vest,
can actually cause vasoconstriction portals, heat loss portals.
impairs rate losing heat. feels good. Now back head,
really interesting. major blood flow brain comes four arteries
neck. carotid arteries vertebral arteries. put
cold towel around neck, going putting cold stimulus brain.
great protecting brain. want protect brain, also going
make feel cooler are. will think ready go quickly
just essentially cooled thermostat. - important point.
lot interest nowadays, people marathons, even people
ultras, ultra running, guess everything longer marathon.


last man standing, last man, last woman standing kind things. saying
somebody's hyperthermic, trick subjectively thinking
cooling off putting towel can go further, brain cook?
- Well, stop cooling,

00:26:43 Exercise-Induced Brain Fog

hot blood body core going go brain. - Interesting, well,
bit tangent, many people report long bouts exercise, even just
intense bouts exercise, feeling kind brain fog mental fatigue. assumed
due lowered brain oxygenation post-exercise, possible
post-exercise effects heating cooling brain might impact
cognition, say negatively impact cognition? - certainly possible
know rise temperature decreases cognitive capacity. mean, can
experience yourself. can get treadmill, follow temperature,
just simple activity like adding subtracting. get 39 degrees,
can't anymore. can't just calculate long
treadmill. - phrase cool, calm collected is- - Cool, calm collected. -
goal

00:27:45 Hyperthermia

pursuits. - right. - want talk portals,
mentioned times. ask portals exactly
work can leveraged performance, question
neurobiologist self can't resist, ask. thermostat preoptic area
hypothalamus, interesting me, medial preoptic area also one
known sexually dimorphic, depending testosterone exposure early life, et
cetera. Although people just note not actually testosterone creates
sexual dimorphism, differences. Actually testosterone converted
estrogen. actually estrogen effector, fascinating. Nonetheless,
got area acts thermostat. said collecting information
whole body. mean pathways, neuroscientists like
refer them, afferent input pathways body preoptic area,


map body preoptic area? 'Cause imagine can't
information just coming left shoulder, just right toe. sounds
like need pretty, probably pretty crude map, need complete map
body surface there. - Well, don't need complete map hypothalamus.
mean, thermal afferent information mentioned, also goes
somatosensory cortex. know ice cube touched back,
doesn't necessarily translate change in, say shivering sweating.
information going hypothalamus integrated representation
body temperature. - sort average happening- - average. -
Across body. to, say get hot hot day Popsicles,
summer camp, went sports camp near actually, run around
like crazy. get shade could, were, Popsicles.
Popsicles. - Brain freeze. - kids putting ice cubes
other's shirts something. average, parts body aren't
exposed, mouth exposed ice Popsicle case cold cubes
hands. said, feels really good. - feels good. Yeah. - sounds like
feels deceptively good, reality still quite warm internally. -
Absolutely. Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah. can feel great dangerously
hyperthermic temperature, say get danger zone,
things get bad fast. - symptoms people
lookout hyperthermia? - Essentially, almost ironic individuals
transitioning heat stroke, actually vasoconstrict stop sweating.
pathological situation. couldn't begin explain it. essentially just
feeling exhausted. feeling miserable. heart rate high. heart rate
goes core temperature goes up, called cardiac drift. just feel rotten.
since not danger signal can translate immediately into, oop,
going heat stroke, people can overcome bad feeling
motivation continue going, work harder. there've number high profile
athletic deaths due heat stroke practice. Not competition
people really trying it,

00:31:50 Best Body Sites Cooling: Palms, Foot Pads, Upper Face

practice, shows just motivated push. - talk


magnificent portals not just humans, animals, mammals equipped with.
putting cold neck head torso not optimal,
optimal? maybe walk us theory portals
located are. can talk one might leverage
performance. - Okay, portals are, glabrous skin, big word, okay?
Glabrous just means no hair. hairless skin. say, well, body
without hair. No, body hair follicles. mammals, mammals
fur. lost fur, still hairy skin phenotype body,
except, except skin surfaces mammal relatives didn't fur.
pads feet. primates, upper part face. rabbits, no portions
ears, inner surfaces ears- - Ah, never thought that. bears,
tongue. Bears big tongues, huge tongues. [chuckles] - didn't know either.
haven't close bear yet. - Haven't leaking match bear. - Not
yet. No. - anyway, mammalian relatives can't lose heat overall body
surface. probably early mammalian evolution, evolved special
blood vessels limited surface areas don't fur. said,
blood vessels shunts arteries veins. Arteries veins
low resistance vessels. can high flow rate. Capillaries, normally
arteries veins high resistance tiny, okay? -
fair say taught blood flows arteries, capillaries,
veins, back heart. sort like heart
arteries, little capillaries, like little estuaries streams
veins, back heart. generally true? - Yeah, absolutely. -
Okay, learned basic physiology still? - still- - wouldn't get F
class? - No. - Maybe D C, not F. - excellent. - Okay.
saying glabrous beneath glabrous skin. - shunts. -
go directly arteries veins? skip capillaries- - Capillaries, yep. -
actually, long I'm, say skin, feel pads hands,
deep surface vessels reside? - the, obviously
epidermis. warm look palms hands, fairly
red backs hands aren't. don't vessels backs
hands. Now take glass, like water tumbler, right? grab it, can
see squeeze little bit, hand goes white. shut off
blood flow. - Oh, interesting. going little home experiment. -


bicycling hot day, don't want grabbing handlebars time.
want periodically. [chuckles] - Well, important. know privy really
amazing results going talk about, actually heard say
lecture recently Stanford held human performance part
of. mentioned this, cycling working hard want
able work, now know want remain cool order
continue work, get warm, bad, gripping handlebars
tightly will actually limit performance. - Right. - probably also true
Peloton kind device skier anything like that. - Right. - loosen
grip, safely can, want actually expose hands world? Now
people wearing gloves? the, just seems crazy
based everything telling me. - Well, gloves definitely impede heat loss
hands, just socks impede heat loss feet, okay? want maximize
heat loss, want thinner protectors possible hands.
course feet problematical, using certain
ways. - people run barefoot. - Yeah. Well, yeah. - Yeah. become somewhat
popular. seems like kind came went. toe shoes things,
looked ridiculous think people just willing take
performance hindrance regular shoes. - Actually track coach
Stanford famous introducing training without shoes, running. -
Interesting. - thought changed posture runner.
think just due fact increasing capacity runners lose
heat. - Interesting, yeah, heating level hands obviously going
hinder performance. running? noticed, ran cross country briefly
high school, not particularly well that, told run
holding crackers fingers something like lightly, keep hands kind
loose. running like actually beneficial performance than,
gripping phone, probably people nowadays, right? -
Right. - Interesting and- - Once, tell experience once. Alaska
winter went running absentmindedly forgot gloves.

00:38:00 Cooling Brain via Upper Face; Concussion

realized short period running, backs hands


aching cold, palms hands sweating hot. - Oh,
amazing. Amazing. compartments real thing. mentioned
upper half face- - upper part, primate ancestors don't
fur. - bottoms feet. just take moment talk
amazing results associated proper cooling glabrous
skin surfaces. - Let introduce one thing. - Sure. - asked earlier
pouring water head, okay? One things not
appreciated fully blood perfusing special blood vessels
face beard line, non-hairy skin, blood returns venous
supply heart, actually strange way. actually goes
called, blocking name now. - Take time. - blood
vessels go skull, okay? scalp bleeds lot cut
scalp. blood vessels called, want say emergent, not
emergent. word means leaving. blood vessels primarily thought
ways blood leaving brain. overheated, direction flow
blood vessels reverses. cool blood coming facial region
goes circulation actually cooling source brain. can cool
brain. can cooling effect brain pouring water head. -
Interesting, practice, we, least me, commonly associate
combat sports, fighter goes corner. usually sit stool,
unless trying mental warfare corner, case,
don't even take seat. corner crew will squeeze glove, excuse me, sponge
full cold water them, saying somewhat effective cooling
brain? - Yeah, one natural mechanisms cooling brain. - want return
point well, known benefit cooling brain terms
offsetting physical damage, offsetting negative effects concussion.
one reasons fighters will often get, back, cold item back
neck head not just cool down, theory might offset
damage neurons. - just can't comment that. aware ideas,
controversial. One things want injury brain
decrease swelling. one ways decrease swelling many parts
body cool. decreases inflammation. decreases blood flow. think
really interesting topic



00:41:25 Extraordinary (Tripling!) Performance Cooling Palms

something investigated. kind hard investigate. - Yeah,
interesting. Okay. hear stories. seen data. believe
stories. Maybe tell us story observation group made
respect anaerobic exercise proper cooling glabrous surfaces.
can talk technology. Maybe give us dips example first. - Okay. -
course, think people familiar dips. supposed to, guess- - Raise
lower body. - Yeah, raise lower body, raise lower body mass
usually legs dangling down. Sometimes people strong enough attach
weight do, essentially compound upper body exercise. - Right. -
One dip not particularly impressive people. 100
impressive. 20 impressive some, et cetera. happens skilled
athlete comes dips multiple sets. happens cool
properly using glabrous skin surface? - story occurred early
investigations first made discoveries cooling benefit increase
work volume, capacity reps, okay? word got over, think,
49ers camp. one players, Greg Clark, tight end time.
tight end Stanford. decided, don't know asked, what,
come check out. Greg came said, "Greg,
good at? activity like do?" said, "Dips. can lot dips. can
40 dips first set. can probably five sets. usual workout me."
said okay. came gym one day exactly did.
40 dips first set, maybe 25 15 down, down- - recall
roughly kind rest periods taking sets? - Yeah, standardized
rest period three minutes, set cooling
injure- - good long rest period. - Yeah. is. - still lot dips. - Yeah,
actually longer rest period many people prefer workouts. want
make time- - Not me. prefer take much rest possibly can,
yeah. - several days later came back first set, did, think, maybe 42,
little bit better, now people standing around watching. little
impetus show off. second set was, don't remember numbers,
much second set control day. cooled his- -
Okay, cooling? - sitting putting hands


devices built, cooling palms hands. - long
cooling take? Can inside three-minute rest period? - Yeah,
doing. standardized interval resting cooling three minutes,
okay. point got fifth set sets
done previous day. said, "I'm not tired. can another set."
can another set. can another set. can another set. one day two
three days later cooling, doubled total work volume. doubled total
number dips. - adding sets repetitions set? - Right,
kept coming back four weeks, twice week. end month,
300 dips. - Wow. percent- - tripled. - tripled. - Tripled,
professional athlete

00:45:35 Enhancing Recovery, Eliminating Soreness w/Intra-workout Cooling

peak physical conditioning, triples can do. - Amazing, terms
ability recover, explored discussed all? understanding
cause enough stress muscle anaerobic training, provide
stimulus compensatory regrowth, et cetera, work, essentially
scale amount recovery needed recovery time. curious
whether not needed longer recover super-performing
workouts? - interesting. major discovery, didn't realize
making time. phenomenon referring delayed

happening extend workout capacity volume, okay?
experience many times athlete anyone will come lab will
exceed previous goals were, previous expectations. can always
see words coming mouth, "I'm going sore tomorrow." never
are. - Interesting. - actually demonstrated naive group.
class, physical conditioning class. half the, first days class,
establish true capacity, do. pretty heavy
workouts new recruits. gave half benefit cooling
half not. record subjective levels delayed onset
muscle soreness. cool, didn't significant muscle soreness. -
Amazing, know also published results, will provide links


papers people seeing similar effects, say, similar performance
enhancing effects, using bench presses, bench press, pushups, sorts
things. Maybe give us example realm endurance work
aerobic work, running, cycling, things sort. - Well, one problems with,
us, equipment now not really portable. mean, portable sense
can carry gym football field. - not going run run
it. - not going run it, right. - equip bicycle it. Although
cooling handles bicycles coming? - good, one itinerant
activity golfing. people put golf carts, and- - people really heat
much golf? - do. - Not disparaging golfers, way
conceptualize golf, like swing walk cart ride meal.
probably just offended golfers there. - Well, one time work
Department Defense. wanted check out, whether not
really worthwhile. sent team special ops soldiers
subjects test out. week. fun week. -
Yeah, work guys. hard driving guys. also know
fun. yeah, definitely have, off quit switch, buried
deep within nervous system. don't like hit quit switch. - guy
wrote final report, gave addendum report said, "Well, tell
this. gotten home, added technology," took technology
them. wanted keep it. - Oh, Yeah. sounds right. - using it,
added 20 yards every club bag. no effin' small deal. - Wow,
allowing people hit further, hit golf ball further? - Right. [chuckles] - Interesting.
right. golf players there, reward get back Craig
little knocks golf.

00:50:00 Multiple Sclerosis: Heat Sensitivity & Amelioration Cooling

don't knock golf. just don't think sport heating
limiting factor. since getting drive, think's going
there? - Well, can heating up. - wear gloves, right? -
wearing glove hot day, forth. let just tell one serious story
golfers individuals multiple sclerosis exceedingly temperature-
sensitive. - didn't know that. - may still mobile, stay cool


locations not increase exercise great extent. subjects
multiple sclerosis just essentially put device golf cart
back playing golf middle summer. - Oh, great. - Yeah. -
great. Anything allows people normal levels livelihood recreation
great. always think performance kinds like peak elite levels
pushing harder, yeah,

00:51:00 Enhancing Endurance Proper Cooling

anything allows people mobile functional great. favorite
example endurance, feel free give us extreme one talk
averages make sure thorough averages versus exceptions. - Right.
haven't done lot field. mean outdoors. endurance hot
room treadmill work, forth. first experiment had, think,
maybe 18 subjects just off street. Maybe just recruited people hallways,
come this. found could, group one trial
without cooling, double endurance, walking treadmill, walking
uphill treadmill heat, like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature, 40
degrees centigrade. - experiment look like? people walk
incline. really warm. people just going hit quit button say,
enough get off treadmill proper cooling.
cooling? - continuously. - see. - laboratory, can

get it. - get. coming, coming. Yeah, think people might
wonder, studies

00:53:00 Cool Mitt, Ice-Cold Cold, 3 Minutes Cooling



incredible results years haven't heard
it? will ask opinion well. just editorialize little bit.
best laboratory work practical applications oftentimes requires many
studies. oftentimes isn't portal, speak, get information
technology sector. company developing technology
people use, purchase use. might well just tell us now, name
company? website? People going want know
can get magical technology? poor man's version well? -
Well, company Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A, website www.coolmitt.com.
CoolMitt just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com - great website. went there,
says right now, technology available professional sports teams
military. true? - Well, stand now new version technology
sort beta test versions. got hands people used
technology before. NFL teams using. college teams.
Olympics. Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball, NBA, National
Tennis Association. locations now trying reporting
back, working? change it? improve it?
forth. are. website, can actually sign one
will able get one [chuckles] finally manufactured. now
made fairly small lots, want change things realize
can improved. - Yeah. Stanford all. want get technology right.
like joke one reasons like Stanford much that, not
colleagues amazing forward thinking, perfectionists.
perfectionist mindset perfect can go live,
speak. Well, think will lot interest. talk technology little
detail moment. talk whether not cruder forms
technology exist either sake safety and/or performance. is, CoolMitt,
understand mitt, glove. put hand into, hold
surface. surface cools hand thereby specialized portal,
cools core body temperature muscles body. Subjectively,
right now, think ice cold think just cool? -
Just cool. - see. - Ice cold cold. people always ask, well, can't just
stick hand bucket ice water? cold. causes


reflex, vasoconstriction portals trying maximize heat loss
from. stick hand cold water, comes out, cold. - just
sealed heat body. - Yeah. Right, sort recommended
someone one point, said, "Well, running, can't just carry frozen juice
can, will gradually melt?" said, "Well, no, going decrease
heat loss hand. every couple minutes switched hands, [chuckles]
might work. - Well, feeling people now well
trying this. long, CoolMitt proper temperature, long people
putting hands Mitt? - We, again, just standardized three
minutes. part reason rate heat loss exponentially
declining curve, okay? three minutes sort gets best part curve.
can go longer get benefit, biggest bang buck first two,
three minutes. - Okay, mentioned number impressive organizations, sports
teams, military using this. not something typically see

probably keeping technology somewhat wraps. Where,
this? running back locker room? mean, military
special operators thing, terms athletes, possible,
hypothetically, athletes somewhat incognito? - possible, really
don't know. People mentioned Stanford, don't see football team
using it. Well, football team Stanford mostly playing cold weather, cool
weather. night games cool. Even day games not hot frequently here.
go hot place like Arizona Utah, least coach,

00:58:20 Can Use Palmer Cooling Enhance Performance

Shaw, says take find benefit.
use it. - Interesting, poor person's, poor man woman's version
this? mentioned juice can passing back forth. mentioned cooling
hands. number people said learning little bit science
technology experienced big effects, positive effects cooling by,
confess, done this, taking package frozen blueberries, just kind passing
back forth hands. Now talking you, realize probably didn't
long enough. probably was, maybe 30 seconds passing back


forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

minutes. - Couple minutes? - Yeah. going happen core
temperature goes down, will eventually shut off heat loss. keeps
going normal. warmed temperature

00:14:45 Anaerobic Activity Locally Increases Muscle Heat

risen half degree, say, doesn't take minutes extract
heat vasodilated. - Interesting, anaerobic athlete?
strength athlete. - Right. anaerobic athlete, say
several sets many reps, whatever doing, core temperature's not
going rise fast, certain muscles used,
temperature muscles will go up. - local effect. - local effect, right. -
Okay. say, sake today, maybe discussion, assume
basic workout, even though people variation 5 sets 5 10 sets 10.
listening, 5 sets 10 5 rep repetitions, 10 sets 10
repetitions, 10 10, 5 5. Yeah, somebody, say, large body
compound movement, like barbell squats lot large body
movements, hip hinging, et cetera. instance, biceps not, involved,
less indirectly. - Right. - effect going heat
quadriceps, heat hamstrings, heat glutes, kind thing. - Right. - see.
- rest, heat will leave muscle, not fast. certainly
heat can't leave muscle fast working out, muscle
contracts, squeezes blood vessels. way heat gets muscle
blood. muscle metabolism can go 50 60-fold anaerobic
activity. means heat production muscle goes 50 60-fold. blood
flow muscle cannot go 50 60-fold. literally capacity cook
muscles. [Craig chuckles]

00:16:45 Temperature Gates Energy Use

- probably appropriate time just mention briefly underlying
mechanism is. will return specifics one can mitigate
heating up, just explain relationship energy production ATP
pyruvate kinase role heat there? - Sure. don't get something


nothing. like steam engine, energy food lost heat.
roughly 20% efficient. energy take food, 20%
can go work, rest lost heat. Now mammals.
use heat keep body temperature considerably environment.
raise body temperature degrees higher, trouble, hyperthermia.
individual muscles can reach hyperthermic limits might experience
whole body. keep damaging muscle hyperthermia,
fail-safe mechanisms. one fail-safe mechanisms enzyme
critical getting fuel. words, results metabolism glucose, getting
fuel mitochondria, making major coinage energy exchange, ATP,
okay? particular enzyme temperature-sensitive. muscle
temperature gets 39 39.5, shuts off. essentially shuts off fuel
supply mitochondria. cannot one rep. - failure,
say that- - Muscle failure. - One component muscular failure overheating
muscle locally? - Right. - There're probably things too. - Well, you, yeah,
lack oxygen, oxygen delivery pretty good muscle. run
glucose, yeah. going impair you. immediate, immediate
impairment muscle activity, muscle fatigue, words,

00:19:00 Local Versus Systemic Fatigue: Heat Fail

rise temperature muscle. - Interesting, want talk
muscle fails locally, burning question mind cannot seem
answer myself. hoping can answer me. say five sets
five squats. hit fit muscular failure given weight. according now
know, quadriceps muscles associated, mean, squat
failed heat triggering, mechanism triggered heat shuts off
muscle. biceps nice cool, telling me. not much
work. indirect work. can't set bar squat rack,
walk barbell curls intensity
barbell curls fresh, not done anything prior? - Well, will still fatigue
curve upper body, okay? will influenced rise temperature
generated lower body exercise. - temperature cases
limiting factor? - one limiting factor. one limiting factor. - find amazing.


find amazing always thought naively reason muscles fail
because, quote, don't strength another repetition. lack glycogen
ability access glycogen. course, still glycogen. naive
think that, wait three minutes go back, can
repetitions again. glycogen wasn't restored three minutes, obviously
there. - Right. - realized might mechanisms involved. Sounds like
heat is, not dominant mechanism prevents work. one them. -
one them. quick one. fast one. can happen with, say
really experienced weightlifter, okay? may very, high weights
sets five six. - Yeah, clear audience, not high weights
sets five. [chuckles] [Craig laughs] not particularly strong. not super weak,
not particularly strong, Craig's referring, general sense, you.
finish set squats, can't simply cool off quadriceps throwing nice
cool towel quadriceps. not best way go it? -
body surface good insulator. Okay, think don't fur,
therefore not insulated, skin, fascia, muscles underneath,
good insulators. said earlier way heat gets
muscle blood. - want step couple portals one
might think heating cooling ideal. get back these. - Sure.

00:22:10 Cooling Off: Methods Counterproductive

- Specialized surfaces hands, feet face. - [Craig] Yeah. -
throwing cold towel even ice cold towel quadriceps isn't going work
standing front fan, insulated cool, can't cool off blood
fast enough. drinking 16 ounces ice water? - Sure. can that.
can calculate much heat can absorb, okay? can't continue
drinking liters ice water. going dilute blood problems.
yes, it'll help. Sure, will help. doesn't full capacity will need. -
ice pack back neck head squeezing cold
sponge head? deliberately moving options,
ones see often. actually just watching Olympic track
field trials last night Oregon. huge track field fan.
lot sponges backs necks before, between, events.


good poor strategy? Since now know overheated
locally systemically throughout body serious limiting factor performance. -
Well, understand something thermoregulatory system.
thermostat just like thermostat house. thermostat
brain, okay? - know specific site? - Yes. - Yes. - called preoptic interior
hypothalamus. many things terms physiological regulation, serves
thermostat. Now thermostat information. input.
input come from? comes overall body surface sense
temperature, okay? one things can happen overheated
can send cold stimulus thermostat sort like wanting cool
house putting wet washcloth thermostat, wrong thing.
actually experiences people exercising, getting
overheated, cooling body surface, say feels great.
fantastic. core temperature going up. - Well, think important
point. First all, weaned laboratory always battles
temperature lab. people always putting ice packs thermostats
putting fans towards thermostats trying play game. Good know
foolish, even though neurobiologists. Putting cold towel torso
putting ice back upper back, saying actually heat
core? - It'll least decrease heat loss, rate heat loss going
raise issue little later, know, natural portals heat loss.
can think natural portals heat loss air conditioners, okay?
thermostats brain information thermostat coming overall
body surface. can happen you, say, cool torso ice vest,
can actually cause vasoconstriction portals, heat loss portals.
impairs rate losing heat. feels good. Now back head,
really interesting. major blood flow brain comes four arteries
neck. carotid arteries vertebral arteries. put
cold towel around neck, going putting cold stimulus brain.
great protecting brain. want protect brain, also going
make feel cooler are. will think ready go quickly
just essentially cooled thermostat. - important point.
lot interest nowadays, people marathons, even people
ultras, ultra running, guess everything longer marathon.


last man standing, last man, last woman standing kind things. saying
somebody's hyperthermic, trick subjectively thinking
cooling off putting towel can go further, brain cook?
- Well, stop cooling,

00:26:43 Exercise-Induced Brain Fog

hot blood body core going go brain. - Interesting, well,
bit tangent, many people report long bouts exercise, even just
intense bouts exercise, feeling kind brain fog mental fatigue. assumed
due lowered brain oxygenation post-exercise, possible
post-exercise effects heating cooling brain might impact
cognition, say negatively impact cognition? - certainly possible
know rise temperature decreases cognitive capacity. mean, can
experience yourself. can get treadmill, follow temperature,
just simple activity like adding subtracting. get 39 degrees,
can't anymore. can't just calculate long
treadmill. - phrase cool, calm collected is- - Cool, calm collected. -
goal

00:27:45 Hyperthermia

pursuits. - right. - want talk portals,
mentioned times. ask portals exactly
work can leveraged performance, question
neurobiologist self can't resist, ask. thermostat preoptic area
hypothalamus, interesting me, medial preoptic area also one
known sexually dimorphic, depending testosterone exposure early life, et
cetera. Although people just note not actually testosterone creates
sexual dimorphism, differences. Actually testosterone converted
estrogen. actually estrogen effector, fascinating. Nonetheless,
got area acts thermostat. said collecting information
whole body. mean pathways, neuroscientists like
refer them, afferent input pathways body preoptic area,


map body preoptic area? 'Cause imagine can't
information just coming left shoulder, just right toe. sounds
like need pretty, probably pretty crude map, need complete map
body surface there. - Well, don't need complete map hypothalamus.
mean, thermal afferent information mentioned, also goes
somatosensory cortex. know ice cube touched back,
doesn't necessarily translate change in, say shivering sweating.
information going hypothalamus integrated representation
body temperature. - sort average happening- - average. -
Across body. to, say get hot hot day Popsicles,
summer camp, went sports camp near actually, run around
like crazy. get shade could, were, Popsicles.
Popsicles. - Brain freeze. - kids putting ice cubes
other's shirts something. average, parts body aren't
exposed, mouth exposed ice Popsicle case cold cubes
hands. said, feels really good. - feels good. Yeah. - sounds like
feels deceptively good, reality still quite warm internally. -
Absolutely. Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah. can feel great dangerously
hyperthermic temperature, say get danger zone,
things get bad fast. - symptoms people
lookout hyperthermia? - Essentially, almost ironic individuals
transitioning heat stroke, actually vasoconstrict stop sweating.
pathological situation. couldn't begin explain it. essentially just
feeling exhausted. feeling miserable. heart rate high. heart rate
goes core temperature goes up, called cardiac drift. just feel rotten.
since not danger signal can translate immediately into, oop,
going heat stroke, people can overcome bad feeling
motivation continue going, work harder. there've number high profile
athletic deaths due heat stroke practice. Not competition
people really trying it,

00:31:50 Best Body Sites Cooling: Palms, Foot Pads, Upper Face

practice, shows just motivated push. - talk


magnificent portals not just humans, animals, mammals equipped with.
putting cold neck head torso not optimal,
optimal? maybe walk us theory portals
located are. can talk one might leverage
performance. - Okay, portals are, glabrous skin, big word, okay?
Glabrous just means no hair. hairless skin. say, well, body
without hair. No, body hair follicles. mammals, mammals
fur. lost fur, still hairy skin phenotype body,
except, except skin surfaces mammal relatives didn't fur.
pads feet. primates, upper part face. rabbits, no portions
ears, inner surfaces ears- - Ah, never thought that. bears,
tongue. Bears big tongues, huge tongues. [chuckles] - didn't know either.
haven't close bear yet. - Haven't leaking match bear. - Not
yet. No. - anyway, mammalian relatives can't lose heat overall body
surface. probably early mammalian evolution, evolved special
blood vessels limited surface areas don't fur. said,
blood vessels shunts arteries veins. Arteries veins
low resistance vessels. can high flow rate. Capillaries, normally
arteries veins high resistance tiny, okay? -
fair say taught blood flows arteries, capillaries,
veins, back heart. sort like heart
arteries, little capillaries, like little estuaries streams
veins, back heart. generally true? - Yeah, absolutely. -
Okay, learned basic physiology still? - still- - wouldn't get F
class? - No. - Maybe D C, not F. - excellent. - Okay.
saying glabrous beneath glabrous skin. - shunts. -
go directly arteries veins? skip capillaries- - Capillaries, yep. -
actually, long I'm, say skin, feel pads hands,
deep surface vessels reside? - the, obviously
epidermis. warm look palms hands, fairly
red backs hands aren't. don't vessels backs
hands. Now take glass, like water tumbler, right? grab it, can
see squeeze little bit, hand goes white. shut off
blood flow. - Oh, interesting. going little home experiment. -


bicycling hot day, don't want grabbing handlebars time.
want periodically. [chuckles] - Well, important. know privy really
amazing results going talk about, actually heard say
lecture recently Stanford held human performance part
of. mentioned this, cycling working hard want
able work, now know want remain cool order
continue work, get warm, bad, gripping handlebars
tightly will actually limit performance. - Right. - probably also true
Peloton kind device skier anything like that. - Right. - loosen
grip, safely can, want actually expose hands world? Now
people wearing gloves? the, just seems crazy
based everything telling me. - Well, gloves definitely impede heat loss
hands, just socks impede heat loss feet, okay? want maximize
heat loss, want thinner protectors possible hands.
course feet problematical, using certain
ways. - people run barefoot. - Yeah. Well, yeah. - Yeah. become somewhat
popular. seems like kind came went. toe shoes things,
looked ridiculous think people just willing take
performance hindrance regular shoes. - Actually track coach
Stanford famous introducing training without shoes, running. -
Interesting. - thought changed posture runner.
think just due fact increasing capacity runners lose
heat. - Interesting, yeah, heating level hands obviously going
hinder performance. running? noticed, ran cross country briefly
high school, not particularly well that, told run
holding crackers fingers something like lightly, keep hands kind
loose. running like actually beneficial performance than,
gripping phone, probably people nowadays, right? -
Right. - Interesting and- - Once, tell experience once. Alaska
winter went running absentmindedly forgot gloves.

00:38:00 Cooling Brain via Upper Face; Concussion

realized short period running, backs hands


aching cold, palms hands sweating hot. - Oh,
amazing. Amazing. compartments real thing. mentioned
upper half face- - upper part, primate ancestors don't
fur. - bottoms feet. just take moment talk
amazing results associated proper cooling glabrous
skin surfaces. - Let introduce one thing. - Sure. - asked earlier
pouring water head, okay? One things not
appreciated fully blood perfusing special blood vessels
face beard line, non-hairy skin, blood returns venous
supply heart, actually strange way. actually goes
called, blocking name now. - Take time. - blood
vessels go skull, okay? scalp bleeds lot cut
scalp. blood vessels called, want say emergent, not
emergent. word means leaving. blood vessels primarily thought
ways blood leaving brain. overheated, direction flow
blood vessels reverses. cool blood coming facial region
goes circulation actually cooling source brain. can cool
brain. can cooling effect brain pouring water head. -
Interesting, practice, we, least me, commonly associate
combat sports, fighter goes corner. usually sit stool,
unless trying mental warfare corner, case,
don't even take seat. corner crew will squeeze glove, excuse me, sponge
full cold water them, saying somewhat effective cooling
brain? - Yeah, one natural mechanisms cooling brain. - want return
point well, known benefit cooling brain terms
offsetting physical damage, offsetting negative effects concussion.
one reasons fighters will often get, back, cold item back
neck head not just cool down, theory might offset
damage neurons. - just can't comment that. aware ideas,
controversial. One things want injury brain
decrease swelling. one ways decrease swelling many parts
body cool. decreases inflammation. decreases blood flow. think
really interesting topic



00:41:25 Extraordinary (Tripling!) Performance Cooling Palms

something investigated. kind hard investigate. - Yeah,
interesting. Okay. hear stories. seen data. believe
stories. Maybe tell us story observation group made
respect anaerobic exercise proper cooling glabrous surfaces.
can talk technology. Maybe give us dips example first. - Okay. -
course, think people familiar dips. supposed to, guess- - Raise
lower body. - Yeah, raise lower body, raise lower body mass
usually legs dangling down. Sometimes people strong enough attach
weight do, essentially compound upper body exercise. - Right. -
One dip not particularly impressive people. 100
impressive. 20 impressive some, et cetera. happens skilled
athlete comes dips multiple sets. happens cool
properly using glabrous skin surface? - story occurred early
investigations first made discoveries cooling benefit increase
work volume, capacity reps, okay? word got over, think,
49ers camp. one players, Greg Clark, tight end time.
tight end Stanford. decided, don't know asked, what,
come check out. Greg came said, "Greg,
good at? activity like do?" said, "Dips. can lot dips. can
40 dips first set. can probably five sets. usual workout me."
said okay. came gym one day exactly did.
40 dips first set, maybe 25 15 down, down- - recall
roughly kind rest periods taking sets? - Yeah, standardized
rest period three minutes, set cooling
injure- - good long rest period. - Yeah. is. - still lot dips. - Yeah,
actually longer rest period many people prefer workouts. want
make time- - Not me. prefer take much rest possibly can,
yeah. - several days later came back first set, did, think, maybe 42,
little bit better, now people standing around watching. little
impetus show off. second set was, don't remember numbers,
much second set control day. cooled his- -
Okay, cooling? - sitting putting hands


devices built, cooling palms hands. - long
cooling take? Can inside three-minute rest period? - Yeah,
doing. standardized interval resting cooling three minutes,
okay. point got fifth set sets
done previous day. said, "I'm not tired. can another set."
can another set. can another set. can another set. one day two
three days later cooling, doubled total work volume. doubled total
number dips. - adding sets repetitions set? - Right,
kept coming back four weeks, twice week. end month,
300 dips. - Wow. percent- - tripled. - tripled. - Tripled,
professional athlete

Amazing, know also published results, will provide links


papers people seeing similar effects, say, similar performance
enhancing effects, using bench presses, bench press, pushups, sorts
things. Maybe give us example realm endurance work
aerobic work, running, cycling, things sort. - Well, one problems with,
us, equipment now not really portable. mean, portable sense
can carry gym football field. - not going run run

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool

palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see

cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

nothing. like steam engine, energy food lost heat.
roughly 20% efficient. energy take food, 20%
can go work, rest lost heat. Now mammals.
use heat keep body temperature considerably environment.
raise body temperature degrees higher, trouble, hyperthermia.
individual muscles can reach hyperthermic limits might experience
whole body. keep damaging muscle hyperthermia,
fail-safe mechanisms. one fail-safe mechanisms enzyme
critical getting fuel. words, results metabolism glucose, getting
fuel mitochondria, making major coinage energy exchange, ATP,
okay? particular enzyme temperature-sensitive. muscle
temperature gets 39 39.5, shuts off. essentially shuts off fuel
supply mitochondria. cannot one rep. - failure,
say that- - Muscle failure. - One component muscular failure overheating
muscle locally? - Right. - There're probably things too. - Well, you, yeah,
lack oxygen, oxygen delivery pretty good muscle. run
glucose, yeah. going impair you. immediate, immediate
impairment muscle activity, muscle fatigue, words,

00:19:00 Local Versus Systemic Fatigue: Heat Fail

rise temperature muscle. - Interesting, want talk
muscle fails locally, burning question mind cannot seem
answer myself. hoping can answer me. say five sets
five squats. hit fit muscular failure given weight. according now
know, quadriceps muscles associated, mean, squat
failed heat triggering, mechanism triggered heat shuts off
muscle. biceps nice cool, telling me. not much
work. indirect work. can't set bar squat rack,
walk barbell curls intensity
barbell curls fresh, not done anything prior? - Well, will still fatigue
curve upper body, okay? will influenced rise temperature
generated lower body exercise. - temperature cases
limiting factor? - one limiting factor. one limiting factor. - find amazing.


find amazing always thought naively reason muscles fail
because, quote, don't strength another repetition. lack glycogen
ability access glycogen. course, still glycogen. naive
think that, wait three minutes go back, can
repetitions again. glycogen wasn't restored three minutes, obviously
there. - Right. - realized might mechanisms involved. Sounds like
heat is, not dominant mechanism prevents work. one them. -
one them. quick one. fast one. can happen with, say
really experienced weightlifter, okay? may very, high weights
sets five six. - Yeah, clear audience, not high weights
sets five. [chuckles] [Craig laughs] not particularly strong. not super weak,
not particularly strong, Craig's referring, general sense, you.
finish set squats, can't simply cool off quadriceps throwing nice
cool towel quadriceps. not best way go it? -
body surface good insulator. Okay, think don't fur,
therefore not insulated, skin, fascia, muscles underneath,
good insulators. said earlier way heat gets
muscle blood. - want step couple portals one
might think heating cooling ideal. get back these. - Sure.

00:22:10 Cooling Off: Methods Counterproductive

- Specialized surfaces hands, feet face. - [Craig] Yeah. -
throwing cold towel even ice cold towel quadriceps isn't going work
standing front fan, insulated cool, can't cool off blood
fast enough. drinking 16 ounces ice water? - Sure. can that.
can calculate much heat can absorb, okay? can't continue
drinking liters ice water. going dilute blood problems.
yes, it'll help. Sure, will help. doesn't full capacity will need. -
ice pack back neck head squeezing cold
sponge head? deliberately moving options,
ones see often. actually just watching Olympic track
field trials last night Oregon. huge track field fan.
lot sponges backs necks before, between, events.


good poor strategy? Since now know overheated
locally systemically throughout body serious limiting factor performance. -
Well, understand something thermoregulatory system.
thermostat just like thermostat house. thermostat
brain, okay? - know specific site? - Yes. - Yes. - called preoptic interior
hypothalamus. many things terms physiological regulation, serves
thermostat. Now thermostat information. input.
input come from? comes overall body surface sense
temperature, okay? one things can happen overheated
can send cold stimulus thermostat sort like wanting cool
house putting wet washcloth thermostat, wrong thing.
actually experiences people exercising, getting
overheated, cooling body surface, say feels great.
fantastic. core temperature going up. - Well, think important
point. First all, weaned laboratory always battles
temperature lab. people always putting ice packs thermostats
putting fans towards thermostats trying play game. Good know
foolish, even though neurobiologists. Putting cold towel torso
putting ice back upper back, saying actually heat
core? - It'll least decrease heat loss, rate heat loss going
raise issue little later, know, natural portals heat loss.
can think natural portals heat loss air conditioners, okay?
thermostats brain information thermostat coming overall
body surface. can happen you, say, cool torso ice vest,
can actually cause vasoconstriction portals, heat loss portals.
impairs rate losing heat. feels good. Now back head,
really interesting. major blood flow brain comes four arteries
neck. carotid arteries vertebral arteries. put
cold towel around neck, going putting cold stimulus brain.
great protecting brain. want protect brain, also going
make feel cooler are. will think ready go quickly
just essentially cooled thermostat. - important point.
lot interest nowadays, people marathons, even people
ultras, ultra running, guess everything longer marathon.


last man standing, last man, last woman standing kind things. saying
somebody's hyperthermic, trick subjectively thinking
cooling off putting towel can go further, brain cook?
- Well, stop cooling,

00:26:43 Exercise-Induced Brain Fog

hot blood body core going go brain. - Interesting, well,
bit tangent, many people report long bouts exercise, even just
intense bouts exercise, feeling kind brain fog mental fatigue. assumed
due lowered brain oxygenation post-exercise, possible
post-exercise effects heating cooling brain might impact
cognition, say negatively impact cognition? - certainly possible
know rise temperature decreases cognitive capacity. mean, can
experience yourself. can get treadmill, follow temperature,
just simple activity like adding subtracting. get 39 degrees,
can't anymore. can't just calculate long
treadmill. - phrase cool, calm collected is- - Cool, calm collected. -
goal

00:27:45 Hyperthermia

pursuits. - right. - want talk portals,
mentioned times. ask portals exactly
work can leveraged performance, question
neurobiologist self can't resist, ask. thermostat preoptic area
hypothalamus, interesting me, medial preoptic area also one
known sexually dimorphic, depending testosterone exposure early life, et
cetera. Although people just note not actually testosterone creates
sexual dimorphism, differences. Actually testosterone converted
estrogen. actually estrogen effector, fascinating. Nonetheless,
got area acts thermostat. said collecting information
whole body. mean pathways, neuroscientists like
refer them, afferent input pathways body preoptic area,


map body preoptic area? 'Cause imagine can't
information just coming left shoulder, just right toe. sounds
like need pretty, probably pretty crude map, need complete map
body surface there. - Well, don't need complete map hypothalamus.
mean, thermal afferent information mentioned, also goes
somatosensory cortex. know ice cube touched back,
doesn't necessarily translate change in, say shivering sweating.
information going hypothalamus integrated representation
body temperature. - sort average happening- - average. -
Across body. to, say get hot hot day Popsicles,
summer camp, went sports camp near actually, run around
like crazy. get shade could, were, Popsicles.
Popsicles. - Brain freeze. - kids putting ice cubes
other's shirts something. average, parts body aren't
exposed, mouth exposed ice Popsicle case cold cubes
hands. said, feels really good. - feels good. Yeah. - sounds like
feels deceptively good, reality still quite warm internally. -
Absolutely. Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah. can feel great dangerously
hyperthermic temperature, say get danger zone,
things get bad fast. - symptoms people
lookout hyperthermia? - Essentially, almost ironic individuals
transitioning heat stroke, actually vasoconstrict stop sweating.
pathological situation. couldn't begin explain it. essentially just
feeling exhausted. feeling miserable. heart rate high. heart rate
goes core temperature goes up, called cardiac drift. just feel rotten.
since not danger signal can translate immediately into, oop,
going heat stroke, people can overcome bad feeling
motivation continue going, work harder. there've number high profile
athletic deaths due heat stroke practice. Not competition
people really trying it,

00:31:50 Best Body Sites Cooling: Palms, Foot Pads, Upper Face

practice, shows just motivated push. - talk


magnificent portals not just humans, animals, mammals equipped with.
putting cold neck head torso not optimal,
optimal? maybe walk us theory portals
located are. can talk one might leverage
performance. - Okay, portals are, glabrous skin, big word, okay?
Glabrous just means no hair. hairless skin. say, well, body
without hair. No, body hair follicles. mammals, mammals
fur. lost fur, still hairy skin phenotype body,
except, except skin surfaces mammal relatives didn't fur.
pads feet. primates, upper part face. rabbits, no portions
ears, inner surfaces ears- - Ah, never thought that. bears,
tongue. Bears big tongues, huge tongues. [chuckles] - didn't know either.
haven't close bear yet. - Haven't leaking match bear. - Not
yet. No. - anyway, mammalian relatives can't lose heat overall body
surface. probably early mammalian evolution, evolved special
blood vessels limited surface areas don't fur. said,
blood vessels shunts arteries veins. Arteries veins
low resistance vessels. can high flow rate. Capillaries, normally
arteries veins high resistance tiny, okay? -
fair say taught blood flows arteries, capillaries,
veins, back heart. sort like heart
arteries, little capillaries, like little estuaries streams
veins, back heart. generally true? - Yeah, absolutely. -
Okay, learned basic physiology still? - still- - wouldn't get F
class? - No. - Maybe D C, not F. - excellent. - Okay.
saying glabrous beneath glabrous skin. - shunts. -
go directly arteries veins? skip capillaries- - Capillaries, yep. -
actually, long I'm, say skin, feel pads hands,
deep surface vessels reside? - the, obviously
epidermis. warm look palms hands, fairly
red backs hands aren't. don't vessels backs
hands. Now take glass, like water tumbler, right? grab it, can
see squeeze little bit, hand goes white. shut off
blood flow. - Oh, interesting. going little home experiment. -


bicycling hot day, don't want grabbing handlebars time.
want periodically. [chuckles] - Well, important. know privy really
amazing results going talk about, actually heard say
lecture recently Stanford held human performance part
of. mentioned this, cycling working hard want
able work, now know want remain cool order
continue work, get warm, bad, gripping handlebars
tightly will actually limit performance. - Right. - probably also true
Peloton kind device skier anything like that. - Right. - loosen
grip, safely can, want actually expose hands world? Now
people wearing gloves? the, just seems crazy
based everything telling me. - Well, gloves definitely impede heat loss
hands, just socks impede heat loss feet, okay? want maximize
heat loss, want thinner protectors possible hands.
course feet problematical, using certain
ways. - people run barefoot. - Yeah. Well, yeah. - Yeah. become somewhat
popular. seems like kind came went. toe shoes things,
looked ridiculous think people just willing take
performance hindrance regular shoes. - Actually track coach
Stanford famous introducing training without shoes, running. -
Interesting. - thought changed posture runner.
think just due fact increasing capacity runners lose
heat. - Interesting, yeah, heating level hands obviously going
hinder performance. running? noticed, ran cross country briefly
high school, not particularly well that, told run
holding crackers fingers something like lightly, keep hands kind
loose. running like actually beneficial performance than,
gripping phone, probably people nowadays, right? -
Right. - Interesting and- - Once, tell experience once. Alaska
winter went running absentmindedly forgot gloves.

00:38:00 Cooling Brain via Upper Face; Concussion

realized short period running, backs hands


aching cold, palms hands sweating hot. - Oh,
amazing. Amazing. compartments real thing. mentioned
upper half face- - upper part, primate ancestors don't
fur. - bottoms feet. just take moment talk
amazing results associated proper cooling glabrous
skin surfaces. - Let introduce one thing. - Sure. - asked earlier
pouring water head, okay? One things not
appreciated fully blood perfusing special blood vessels
face beard line, non-hairy skin, blood returns venous
supply heart, actually strange way. actually goes
called, blocking name now. - Take time. - blood
vessels go skull, okay? scalp bleeds lot cut
scalp. blood vessels called, want say emergent, not
emergent. word means leaving. blood vessels primarily thought
ways blood leaving brain. overheated, direction flow
blood vessels reverses. cool blood coming facial region
goes circulation actually cooling source brain. can cool
brain. can cooling effect brain pouring water head. -
Interesting, practice, we, least me, commonly associate
combat sports, fighter goes corner. usually sit stool,
unless trying mental warfare corner, case,
don't even take seat. corner crew will squeeze glove, excuse me, sponge
full cold water them, saying somewhat effective cooling
brain? - Yeah, one natural mechanisms cooling brain. - want return
point well, known benefit cooling brain terms
offsetting physical damage, offsetting negative effects concussion.
one reasons fighters will often get, back, cold item back
neck head not just cool down, theory might offset
damage neurons. - just can't comment that. aware ideas,
controversial. One things want injury brain
decrease swelling. one ways decrease swelling many parts
body cool. decreases inflammation. decreases blood flow. think
really interesting topic



00:41:25 Extraordinary (Tripling!) Performance Cooling Palms

something investigated. kind hard investigate. - Yeah,
interesting. Okay. hear stories. seen data. believe
stories. Maybe tell us story observation group made
respect anaerobic exercise proper cooling glabrous surfaces.
can talk technology. Maybe give us dips example first. - Okay. -
course, think people familiar dips. supposed to, guess- - Raise
lower body. - Yeah, raise lower body, raise lower body mass
usually legs dangling down. Sometimes people strong enough attach
weight do, essentially compound upper body exercise. - Right. -
One dip not particularly impressive people. 100
impressive. 20 impressive some, et cetera. happens skilled
athlete comes dips multiple sets. happens cool
properly using glabrous skin surface? - story occurred early
investigations first made discoveries cooling benefit increase
work volume, capacity reps, okay? word got over, think,
49ers camp. one players, Greg Clark, tight end time.
tight end Stanford. decided, don't know asked, what,
come check out. Greg came said, "Greg,
good at? activity like do?" said, "Dips. can lot dips. can
40 dips first set. can probably five sets. usual workout me."
said okay. came gym one day exactly did.
40 dips first set, maybe 25 15 down, down- - recall
roughly kind rest periods taking sets? - Yeah, standardized
rest period three minutes, set cooling
injure- - good long rest period. - Yeah. is. - still lot dips. - Yeah,
actually longer rest period many people prefer workouts. want
make time- - Not me. prefer take much rest possibly can,
yeah. - several days later came back first set, did, think, maybe 42,
little bit better, now people standing around watching. little
impetus show off. second set was, don't remember numbers,
much second set control day. cooled his- -
Okay, cooling? - sitting putting hands


devices built, cooling palms hands. - long
cooling take? Can inside three-minute rest period? - Yeah,
doing. standardized interval resting cooling three minutes,
okay. point got fifth set sets
done previous day. said, "I'm not tired. can another set."
can another set. can another set. can another set. one day two
three days later cooling, doubled total work volume. doubled total
number dips. - adding sets repetitions set? - Right,
kept coming back four weeks, twice week. end month,
300 dips. - Wow. percent- - tripled. - tripled. - Tripled,
professional athlete

00:45:35 Enhancing Recovery, Eliminating Soreness w/Intra-workout Cooling

peak physical conditioning, triples can do. - Amazing, terms
ability recover, explored discussed all? understanding
cause enough stress muscle anaerobic training, provide
stimulus compensatory regrowth, et cetera, work, essentially
scale amount recovery needed recovery time. curious
whether not needed longer recover super-performing
workouts? - interesting. major discovery, didn't realize
making time. phenomenon referring delayed
onset muscle soreness, DOMS. due little micro tares, forth,
happening extend workout capacity volume, okay?
experience many times athlete anyone will come lab will
exceed previous goals were, previous expectations. can always
see words coming mouth, "I'm going sore tomorrow." never
are. - Interesting. - actually demonstrated naive group.
class, physical conditioning class. half the, first days class,
establish true capacity, do. pretty heavy
workouts new recruits. gave half benefit cooling
half not. record subjective levels delayed onset
muscle soreness. cool, didn't significant muscle soreness. -
Amazing, know also published results, will provide links


papers people seeing similar effects, say, similar performance
enhancing effects, using bench presses, bench press, pushups, sorts
things. Maybe give us example realm endurance work
aerobic work, running, cycling, things sort. - Well, one problems with,
us, equipment now not really portable. mean, portable sense
can carry gym football field. - not going run run
it. - not going run it, right. - equip bicycle it. Although
cooling handles bicycles coming? - good, one itinerant
activity golfing. people put golf carts, and- - people really heat
much golf? - do. - Not disparaging golfers, way
conceptualize golf, like swing walk cart ride meal.
probably just offended golfers there. - Well, one time work
Department Defense. wanted check out, whether not
really worthwhile. sent team special ops soldiers
subjects test out. week. fun week. -
Yeah, work guys. hard driving guys. also know
fun. yeah, definitely have, off quit switch, buried
deep within nervous system. don't like hit quit switch. - guy
wrote final report, gave addendum report said, "Well, tell
this. gotten home, added technology," took technology
them. wanted keep it. - Oh, Yeah. sounds right. - using it,
added 20 yards every club bag. no effin' small deal. - Wow,
allowing people hit further, hit golf ball further? - Right. [chuckles] - Interesting.
right. golf players there, reward get back Craig
little knocks golf.

00:50:00 Multiple Sclerosis: Heat Sensitivity & Amelioration Cooling

don't knock golf. just don't think sport heating
limiting factor. since getting drive, think's going
there? - Well, can heating up. - wear gloves, right? -
wearing glove hot day, forth. let just tell one serious story
golfers individuals multiple sclerosis exceedingly temperature-
sensitive. - didn't know that. - may still mobile, stay cool


locations not increase exercise great extent. subjects
multiple sclerosis just essentially put device golf cart
back playing golf middle summer. - Oh, great. - Yeah. -
great. Anything allows people normal levels livelihood recreation
great. always think performance kinds like peak elite levels
pushing harder, yeah,

00:51:00 Enhancing Endurance Proper Cooling

anything allows people mobile functional great. favorite
example endurance, feel free give us extreme one talk
averages make sure thorough averages versus exceptions. - Right.
haven't done lot field. mean outdoors. endurance hot
room treadmill work, forth. first experiment had, think,
maybe 18 subjects just off street. Maybe just recruited people hallways,
come this. found could, group one trial
without cooling, double endurance, walking treadmill, walking
uphill treadmill heat, like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature, 40
degrees centigrade. - experiment look like? people walk
incline. really warm. people just going hit quit button say,
enough get off treadmill proper cooling.
cooling? - continuously. - see. - laboratory, can
suspend devices ceiling, example. Now prototype wearable
devices. response emails Ebola workers number years ago
Sierra Leone. said, "We've read work athletes. Can't
something us? mean, personal protective gear, can't
hot zone 15 20 minutes." started us challenge
developing wearable systems go PPE. published work
now, but-. - great, guessing military special operators
desert locations probably excited technology. - Well,
get it. - get. coming, coming. Yeah, think people might
wonder, studies

00:53:00 Cool Mitt, Ice-Cold Cold, 3 Minutes Cooling



incredible results years haven't heard
it? will ask opinion well. just editorialize little bit.
best laboratory work practical applications oftentimes requires many
studies. oftentimes isn't portal, speak, get information
technology sector. company developing technology
people use, purchase use. might well just tell us now, name
company? website? People going want know
can get magical technology? poor man's version well? -
Well, company Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A, website www.coolmitt.com.
CoolMitt just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com - great website. went there,
says right now, technology available professional sports teams
military. true? - Well, stand now new version technology
sort beta test versions. got hands people used
technology before. NFL teams using. college teams.
Olympics. Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball, NBA, National
Tennis Association. locations now trying reporting
back, working? change it? improve it?
forth. are. website, can actually sign one
will able get one [chuckles] finally manufactured. now
made fairly small lots, want change things realize
can improved. - Yeah. Stanford all. want get technology right.
like joke one reasons like Stanford much that, not
colleagues amazing forward thinking, perfectionists.
perfectionist mindset perfect can go live,
speak. Well, think will lot interest. talk technology little
detail moment. talk whether not cruder forms
technology exist either sake safety and/or performance. is, CoolMitt,
understand mitt, glove. put hand into, hold
surface. surface cools hand thereby specialized portal,
cools core body temperature muscles body. Subjectively,
right now, think ice cold think just cool? -
Just cool. - see. - Ice cold cold. people always ask, well, can't just
stick hand bucket ice water? cold. causes


reflex, vasoconstriction portals trying maximize heat loss
from. stick hand cold water, comes out, cold. - just
sealed heat body. - Yeah. Right, sort recommended
someone one point, said, "Well, running, can't just carry frozen juice
can, will gradually melt?" said, "Well, no, going decrease
heat loss hand. every couple minutes switched hands, [chuckles]
might work. - Well, feeling people now well
trying this. long, CoolMitt proper temperature, long people
putting hands Mitt? - We, again, just standardized three
minutes. part reason rate heat loss exponentially
declining curve, okay? three minutes sort gets best part curve.
can go longer get benefit, biggest bang buck first two,
three minutes. - Okay, mentioned number impressive organizations, sports
teams, military using this. not something typically see
sidelines games. Although honest, haven't looked carefully. guessing
probably keeping technology somewhat wraps. Where,
this? running back locker room? mean, military
special operators thing, terms athletes, possible,
hypothetically, athletes somewhat incognito? - possible, really
don't know. People mentioned Stanford, don't see football team
using it. Well, football team Stanford mostly playing cold weather, cool
weather. night games cool. Even day games not hot frequently here.
go hot place like Arizona Utah, least coach,

00:58:20 Can Use Palmer Cooling Enhance Performance

Shaw, says take find benefit.
use it. - Interesting, poor person's, poor man woman's version
this? mentioned juice can passing back forth. mentioned cooling
hands. number people said learning little bit science
technology experienced big effects, positive effects cooling by,
confess, done this, taking package frozen blueberries, just kind passing
back forth hands. Now talking you, realize probably didn't
long enough. probably was, maybe 30 seconds passing back


forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

good insulators. said earlier way heat gets
muscle blood. - want step couple portals one
might think heating cooling ideal. get back these. - Sure.

00:22:10 Cooling Off: Methods Counterproductive

- Specialized surfaces hands, feet face. - [Craig] Yeah. -
throwing cold towel even ice cold towel quadriceps isn't going work
standing front fan, insulated cool, can't cool off blood
fast enough. drinking 16 ounces ice water? - Sure. can that.
can calculate much heat can absorb, okay? can't continue
drinking liters ice water. going dilute blood problems.
yes, it'll help. Sure, will help. doesn't full capacity will need. -
ice pack back neck head squeezing cold
sponge head? deliberately moving options,
ones see often. actually just watching Olympic track
field trials last night Oregon. huge track field fan.
lot sponges backs necks before, between, events.


good poor strategy? Since now know overheated
locally systemically throughout body serious limiting factor performance. -
Well, understand something thermoregulatory system.
thermostat just like thermostat house. thermostat
brain, okay? - know specific site? - Yes. - Yes. - called preoptic interior
hypothalamus. many things terms physiological regulation, serves
thermostat. Now thermostat information. input.
input come from? comes overall body surface sense
temperature, okay? one things can happen overheated
can send cold stimulus thermostat sort like wanting cool
house putting wet washcloth thermostat, wrong thing.
actually experiences people exercising, getting
overheated, cooling body surface, say feels great.
fantastic. core temperature going up. - Well, think important
point. First all, weaned laboratory always battles
temperature lab. people always putting ice packs thermostats
putting fans towards thermostats trying play game. Good know
foolish, even though neurobiologists. Putting cold towel torso
putting ice back upper back, saying actually heat
core? - It'll least decrease heat loss, rate heat loss going
raise issue little later, know, natural portals heat loss.
can think natural portals heat loss air conditioners, okay?
thermostats brain information thermostat coming overall
body surface. can happen you, say, cool torso ice vest,
can actually cause vasoconstriction portals, heat loss portals.
impairs rate losing heat. feels good. Now back head,
really interesting. major blood flow brain comes four arteries
neck. carotid arteries vertebral arteries. put
cold towel around neck, going putting cold stimulus brain.
great protecting brain. want protect brain, also going
make feel cooler are. will think ready go quickly
just essentially cooled thermostat. - important point.
lot interest nowadays, people marathons, even people
ultras, ultra running, guess everything longer marathon.


last man standing, last man, last woman standing kind things. saying
somebody's hyperthermic, trick subjectively thinking
cooling off putting towel can go further, brain cook?
- Well, stop cooling,

00:26:43 Exercise-Induced Brain Fog

hot blood body core going go brain. - Interesting, well,
bit tangent, many people report long bouts exercise, even just
intense bouts exercise, feeling kind brain fog mental fatigue. assumed
due lowered brain oxygenation post-exercise, possible
post-exercise effects heating cooling brain might impact
cognition, say negatively impact cognition? - certainly possible
know rise temperature decreases cognitive capacity. mean, can
experience yourself. can get treadmill, follow temperature,
just simple activity like adding subtracting. get 39 degrees,
can't anymore. can't just calculate long
treadmill. - phrase cool, calm collected is- - Cool, calm collected. -
goal

00:27:45 Hyperthermia

pursuits. - right. - want talk portals,
mentioned times. ask portals exactly
work can leveraged performance, question
neurobiologist self can't resist, ask. thermostat preoptic area
hypothalamus, interesting me, medial preoptic area also one
known sexually dimorphic, depending testosterone exposure early life, et
cetera. Although people just note not actually testosterone creates
sexual dimorphism, differences. Actually testosterone converted
estrogen. actually estrogen effector, fascinating. Nonetheless,
got area acts thermostat. said collecting information
whole body. mean pathways, neuroscientists like
refer them, afferent input pathways body preoptic area,


map body preoptic area? 'Cause imagine can't
information just coming left shoulder, just right toe. sounds
like need pretty, probably pretty crude map, need complete map
body surface there. - Well, don't need complete map hypothalamus.
mean, thermal afferent information mentioned, also goes
somatosensory cortex. know ice cube touched back,
doesn't necessarily translate change in, say shivering sweating.
information going hypothalamus integrated representation
body temperature. - sort average happening- - average. -
Across body. to, say get hot hot day Popsicles,
summer camp, went sports camp near actually, run around
like crazy. get shade could, were, Popsicles.
Popsicles. - Brain freeze. - kids putting ice cubes
other's shirts something. average, parts body aren't
exposed, mouth exposed ice Popsicle case cold cubes
hands. said, feels really good. - feels good. Yeah. - sounds like
feels deceptively good, reality still quite warm internally. -
Absolutely. Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah. can feel great dangerously
hyperthermic temperature, say get danger zone,
things get bad fast. - symptoms people
lookout hyperthermia? - Essentially, almost ironic individuals
transitioning heat stroke, actually vasoconstrict stop sweating.
pathological situation. couldn't begin explain it. essentially just
feeling exhausted. feeling miserable. heart rate high. heart rate
goes core temperature goes up, called cardiac drift. just feel rotten.
since not danger signal can translate immediately into, oop,
going heat stroke, people can overcome bad feeling
motivation continue going, work harder. there've number high profile
athletic deaths due heat stroke practice. Not competition
people really trying it,

00:31:50 Best Body Sites Cooling: Palms, Foot Pads, Upper Face

practice, shows just motivated push. - talk


magnificent portals not just humans, animals, mammals equipped with.
putting cold neck head torso not optimal,
optimal? maybe walk us theory portals
located are. can talk one might leverage
performance. - Okay, portals are, glabrous skin, big word, okay?
Glabrous just means no hair. hairless skin. say, well, body
without hair. No, body hair follicles. mammals, mammals
fur. lost fur, still hairy skin phenotype body,
except, except skin surfaces mammal relatives didn't fur.
pads feet. primates, upper part face. rabbits, no portions
ears, inner surfaces ears- - Ah, never thought that. bears,
tongue. Bears big tongues, huge tongues. [chuckles] - didn't know either.
haven't close bear yet. - Haven't leaking match bear. - Not
yet. No. - anyway, mammalian relatives can't lose heat overall body
surface. probably early mammalian evolution, evolved special
blood vessels limited surface areas don't fur. said,
blood vessels shunts arteries veins. Arteries veins
low resistance vessels. can high flow rate. Capillaries, normally
arteries veins high resistance tiny, okay? -
fair say taught blood flows arteries, capillaries,
veins, back heart. sort like heart
arteries, little capillaries, like little estuaries streams
veins, back heart. generally true? - Yeah, absolutely. -
Okay, learned basic physiology still? - still- - wouldn't get F
class? - No. - Maybe D C, not F. - excellent. - Okay.
saying glabrous beneath glabrous skin. - shunts. -
go directly arteries veins? skip capillaries- - Capillaries, yep. -
actually, long I'm, say skin, feel pads hands,
deep surface vessels reside? - the, obviously
epidermis. warm look palms hands, fairly
red backs hands aren't. don't vessels backs
hands. Now take glass, like water tumbler, right? grab it, can
see squeeze little bit, hand goes white. shut off
blood flow. - Oh, interesting. going little home experiment. -


bicycling hot day, don't want grabbing handlebars time.
want periodically. [chuckles] - Well, important. know privy really
amazing results going talk about, actually heard say
lecture recently Stanford held human performance part
of. mentioned this, cycling working hard want
able work, now know want remain cool order
continue work, get warm, bad, gripping handlebars
tightly will actually limit performance. - Right. - probably also true
Peloton kind device skier anything like that. - Right. - loosen
grip, safely can, want actually expose hands world? Now
people wearing gloves? the, just seems crazy
based everything telling me. - Well, gloves definitely impede heat loss
hands, just socks impede heat loss feet, okay? want maximize
heat loss, want thinner protectors possible hands.
course feet problematical, using certain
ways. - people run barefoot. - Yeah. Well, yeah. - Yeah. become somewhat
popular. seems like kind came went. toe shoes things,
looked ridiculous think people just willing take
performance hindrance regular shoes. - Actually track coach
Stanford famous introducing training without shoes, running. -
Interesting. - thought changed posture runner.
think just due fact increasing capacity runners lose
heat. - Interesting, yeah, heating level hands obviously going
hinder performance. running? noticed, ran cross country briefly
high school, not particularly well that, told run
holding crackers fingers something like lightly, keep hands kind
loose. running like actually beneficial performance than,
gripping phone, probably people nowadays, right? -
Right. - Interesting and- - Once, tell experience once. Alaska
winter went running absentmindedly forgot gloves.

00:38:00 Cooling Brain via Upper Face; Concussion

realized short period running, backs hands


aching cold, palms hands sweating hot. - Oh,
amazing. Amazing. compartments real thing. mentioned
upper half face- - upper part, primate ancestors don't
fur. - bottoms feet. just take moment talk
amazing results associated proper cooling glabrous
skin surfaces. - Let introduce one thing. - Sure. - asked earlier
pouring water head, okay? One things not
appreciated fully blood perfusing special blood vessels
face beard line, non-hairy skin, blood returns venous
supply heart, actually strange way. actually goes
called, blocking name now. - Take time. - blood
vessels go skull, okay? scalp bleeds lot cut
scalp. blood vessels called, want say emergent, not
emergent. word means leaving. blood vessels primarily thought
ways blood leaving brain. overheated, direction flow
blood vessels reverses. cool blood coming facial region
goes circulation actually cooling source brain. can cool
brain. can cooling effect brain pouring water head. -
Interesting, practice, we, least me, commonly associate
combat sports, fighter goes corner. usually sit stool,
unless trying mental warfare corner, case,
don't even take seat. corner crew will squeeze glove, excuse me, sponge
full cold water them, saying somewhat effective cooling
brain? - Yeah, one natural mechanisms cooling brain. - want return
point well, known benefit cooling brain terms
offsetting physical damage, offsetting negative effects concussion.
one reasons fighters will often get, back, cold item back
neck head not just cool down, theory might offset
damage neurons. - just can't comment that. aware ideas,
controversial. One things want injury brain
decrease swelling. one ways decrease swelling many parts
body cool. decreases inflammation. decreases blood flow. think
really interesting topic



00:41:25 Extraordinary (Tripling!) Performance Cooling Palms

something investigated. kind hard investigate. - Yeah,
interesting. Okay. hear stories. seen data. believe
stories. Maybe tell us story observation group made
respect anaerobic exercise proper cooling glabrous surfaces.
can talk technology. Maybe give us dips example first. - Okay. -
course, think people familiar dips. supposed to, guess- - Raise
lower body. - Yeah, raise lower body, raise lower body mass
usually legs dangling down. Sometimes people strong enough attach
weight do, essentially compound upper body exercise. - Right. -
One dip not particularly impressive people. 100
impressive. 20 impressive some, et cetera. happens skilled
athlete comes dips multiple sets. happens cool
properly using glabrous skin surface? - story occurred early
investigations first made discoveries cooling benefit increase
work volume, capacity reps, okay? word got over, think,
49ers camp. one players, Greg Clark, tight end time.
tight end Stanford. decided, don't know asked, what,
come check out. Greg came said, "Greg,
good at? activity like do?" said, "Dips. can lot dips. can
40 dips first set. can probably five sets. usual workout me."
said okay. came gym one day exactly did.
40 dips first set, maybe 25 15 down, down- - recall
roughly kind rest periods taking sets? - Yeah, standardized
rest period three minutes, set cooling
injure- - good long rest period. - Yeah. is. - still lot dips. - Yeah,
actually longer rest period many people prefer workouts. want
make time- - Not me. prefer take much rest possibly can,
yeah. - several days later came back first set, did, think, maybe 42,
little bit better, now people standing around watching. little
impetus show off. second set was, don't remember numbers,
much second set control day. cooled his- -
Okay, cooling? - sitting putting hands


devices built, cooling palms hands. - long
cooling take? Can inside three-minute rest period? - Yeah,
doing. standardized interval resting cooling three minutes,
okay. point got fifth set sets
done previous day. said, "I'm not tired. can another set."
can another set. can another set. can another set. one day two
three days later cooling, doubled total work volume. doubled total
number dips. - adding sets repetitions set? - Right,
kept coming back four weeks, twice week. end month,
300 dips. - Wow. percent- - tripled. - tripled. - Tripled,
professional athlete

00:45:35 Enhancing Recovery, Eliminating Soreness w/Intra-workout Cooling

peak physical conditioning, triples can do. - Amazing, terms
ability recover, explored discussed all? understanding
cause enough stress muscle anaerobic training, provide
stimulus compensatory regrowth, et cetera, work, essentially
scale amount recovery needed recovery time. curious
whether not needed longer recover super-performing
workouts? - interesting. major discovery, didn't realize
making time. phenomenon referring delayed

happening extend workout capacity volume, okay?
experience many times athlete anyone will come lab will
exceed previous goals were, previous expectations. can always
see words coming mouth, "I'm going sore tomorrow." never
are. - Interesting. - actually demonstrated naive group.
class, physical conditioning class. half the, first days class,
establish true capacity, do. pretty heavy
workouts new recruits. gave half benefit cooling
half not. record subjective levels delayed onset
muscle soreness. cool, didn't significant muscle soreness. -
Amazing, know also published results, will provide links


papers people seeing similar effects, say, similar performance
enhancing effects, using bench presses, bench press, pushups, sorts
things. Maybe give us example realm endurance work
aerobic work, running, cycling, things sort. - Well, one problems with,
us, equipment now not really portable. mean, portable sense
can carry gym football field. - not going run run
it. - not going run it, right. - equip bicycle it. Although
cooling handles bicycles coming? - good, one itinerant
activity golfing. people put golf carts, and- - people really heat
much golf? - do. - Not disparaging golfers, way
conceptualize golf, like swing walk cart ride meal.
probably just offended golfers there. - Well, one time work
Department Defense. wanted check out, whether not
really worthwhile. sent team special ops soldiers
subjects test out. week. fun week. -
Yeah, work guys. hard driving guys. also know
fun. yeah, definitely have, off quit switch, buried
deep within nervous system. don't like hit quit switch. - guy
wrote final report, gave addendum report said, "Well, tell
this. gotten home, added technology," took technology
them. wanted keep it. - Oh, Yeah. sounds right. - using it,
added 20 yards every club bag. no effin' small deal. - Wow,
allowing people hit further, hit golf ball further? - Right. [chuckles] - Interesting.
right. golf players there, reward get back Craig
little knocks golf.

00:50:00 Multiple Sclerosis: Heat Sensitivity & Amelioration Cooling

don't knock golf. just don't think sport heating
limiting factor. since getting drive, think's going
there? - Well, can heating up. - wear gloves, right? -
wearing glove hot day, forth. let just tell one serious story
golfers individuals multiple sclerosis exceedingly temperature-
sensitive. - didn't know that. - may still mobile, stay cool


locations not increase exercise great extent. subjects
multiple sclerosis just essentially put device golf cart
back playing golf middle summer. - Oh, great. - Yeah. -
great. Anything allows people normal levels livelihood recreation
great. always think performance kinds like peak elite levels
pushing harder, yeah,

00:51:00 Enhancing Endurance Proper Cooling

anything allows people mobile functional great. favorite
example endurance, feel free give us extreme one talk
averages make sure thorough averages versus exceptions. - Right.
haven't done lot field. mean outdoors. endurance hot
room treadmill work, forth. first experiment had, think,
maybe 18 subjects just off street. Maybe just recruited people hallways,
come this. found could, group one trial
without cooling, double endurance, walking treadmill, walking
uphill treadmill heat, like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature, 40
degrees centigrade. - experiment look like? people walk
incline. really warm. people just going hit quit button say,
enough get off treadmill proper cooling.
cooling? - continuously. - see. - laboratory, can
suspend devices ceiling, example. Now prototype wearable

developing wearable systems go PPE. published work
now, but-. - great, guessing military special operators
desert locations probably excited technology. - Well,
get it. - get. coming, coming. Yeah, think people might
wonder, studies

00:53:00 Cool Mitt, Ice-Cold Cold, 3 Minutes Cooling



incredible results years haven't heard
it? will ask opinion well. just editorialize little bit.
best laboratory work practical applications oftentimes requires many
studies. oftentimes isn't portal, speak, get information
technology sector. company developing technology
people use, purchase use. might well just tell us now, name
company? website? People going want know
can get magical technology? poor man's version well? -
Well, company Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A, website www.coolmitt.com.
CoolMitt just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com - great website. went there,
says right now, technology available professional sports teams
military. true? - Well, stand now new version technology
sort beta test versions. got hands people used
technology before. NFL teams using. college teams.
Olympics. Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball, NBA, National
Tennis Association. locations now trying reporting
back, working? change it? improve it?
forth. are. website, can actually sign one
will able get one [chuckles] finally manufactured. now
made fairly small lots, want change things realize
can improved. - Yeah. Stanford all. want get technology right.
like joke one reasons like Stanford much that, not
colleagues amazing forward thinking, perfectionists.
perfectionist mindset perfect can go live,
speak. Well, think will lot interest. talk technology little
detail moment. talk whether not cruder forms
technology exist either sake safety and/or performance. is, CoolMitt,
understand mitt, glove. put hand into, hold
surface. surface cools hand thereby specialized portal,
cools core body temperature muscles body. Subjectively,
right now, think ice cold think just cool? -
Just cool. - see. - Ice cold cold. people always ask, well, can't just
stick hand bucket ice water? cold. causes


reflex, vasoconstriction portals trying maximize heat loss
from. stick hand cold water, comes out, cold. - just
sealed heat body. - Yeah. Right, sort recommended
someone one point, said, "Well, running, can't just carry frozen juice
can, will gradually melt?" said, "Well, no, going decrease
heat loss hand. every couple minutes switched hands, [chuckles]
might work. - Well, feeling people now well
trying this. long, CoolMitt proper temperature, long people
putting hands Mitt? - We, again, just standardized three
minutes. part reason rate heat loss exponentially
declining curve, okay? three minutes sort gets best part curve.
can go longer get benefit, biggest bang buck first two,
three minutes. - Okay, mentioned number impressive organizations, sports
teams, military using this. not something typically see
sidelines games. Although honest, haven't looked carefully. guessing
probably keeping technology somewhat wraps. Where,
this? running back locker room? mean, military
special operators thing, terms athletes, possible,
hypothetically, athletes somewhat incognito? - possible, really
don't know. People mentioned Stanford, don't see football team
using it. Well, football team Stanford mostly playing cold weather, cool
weather. night games cool. Even day games not hot frequently here.
go hot place like Arizona Utah, least coach,

00:58:20 Can Use Palmer Cooling Enhance Performance

Shaw, says take find benefit.
use it. - Interesting, poor person's, poor man woman's version
this? mentioned juice can passing back forth. mentioned cooling
hands. number people said learning little bit science
technology experienced big effects, positive effects cooling by,
confess, done this, taking package frozen blueberries, just kind passing
back forth hands. Now talking you, realize probably didn't
long enough. probably was, maybe 30 seconds passing back


forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

good poor strategy? Since now know overheated
locally systemically throughout body serious limiting factor performance. -
Well, understand something thermoregulatory system.
thermostat just like thermostat house. thermostat
brain, okay? - know specific site? - Yes. - Yes. - called preoptic interior
hypothalamus. many things terms physiological regulation, serves
thermostat. Now thermostat information. input.
input come from? comes overall body surface sense
temperature, okay? one things can happen overheated
can send cold stimulus thermostat sort like wanting cool
house putting wet washcloth thermostat, wrong thing.
actually experiences people exercising, getting
overheated, cooling body surface, say feels great.
fantastic. core temperature going up. - Well, think important
point. First all, weaned laboratory always battles
temperature lab. people always putting ice packs thermostats
putting fans towards thermostats trying play game. Good know
foolish, even though neurobiologists. Putting cold towel torso
putting ice back upper back, saying actually heat
core? - It'll least decrease heat loss, rate heat loss going
raise issue little later, know, natural portals heat loss.
can think natural portals heat loss air conditioners, okay?
thermostats brain information thermostat coming overall
body surface. can happen you, say, cool torso ice vest,
can actually cause vasoconstriction portals, heat loss portals.
impairs rate losing heat. feels good. Now back head,
really interesting. major blood flow brain comes four arteries
neck. carotid arteries vertebral arteries. put
cold towel around neck, going putting cold stimulus brain.
great protecting brain. want protect brain, also going
make feel cooler are. will think ready go quickly
just essentially cooled thermostat. - important point.
lot interest nowadays, people marathons, even people
ultras, ultra running, guess everything longer marathon.


last man standing, last man, last woman standing kind things. saying
somebody's hyperthermic, trick subjectively thinking
cooling off putting towel can go further, brain cook?
- Well, stop cooling,

00:26:43 Exercise-Induced Brain Fog

hot blood body core going go brain. - Interesting, well,
bit tangent, many people report long bouts exercise, even just
intense bouts exercise, feeling kind brain fog mental fatigue. assumed
due lowered brain oxygenation post-exercise, possible
post-exercise effects heating cooling brain might impact
cognition, say negatively impact cognition? - certainly possible
know rise temperature decreases cognitive capacity. mean, can
experience yourself. can get treadmill, follow temperature,
just simple activity like adding subtracting. get 39 degrees,
can't anymore. can't just calculate long
treadmill. - phrase cool, calm collected is- - Cool, calm collected. -
goal

00:27:45 Hyperthermia

pursuits. - right. - want talk portals,
mentioned times. ask portals exactly
work can leveraged performance, question
neurobiologist self can't resist, ask. thermostat preoptic area
hypothalamus, interesting me, medial preoptic area also one
known sexually dimorphic, depending testosterone exposure early life, et
cetera. Although people just note not actually testosterone creates
sexual dimorphism, differences. Actually testosterone converted
estrogen. actually estrogen effector, fascinating. Nonetheless,
got area acts thermostat. said collecting information
whole body. mean pathways, neuroscientists like
refer them, afferent input pathways body preoptic area,


map body preoptic area? 'Cause imagine can't
information just coming left shoulder, just right toe. sounds
like need pretty, probably pretty crude map, need complete map
body surface there. - Well, don't need complete map hypothalamus.
mean, thermal afferent information mentioned, also goes
somatosensory cortex. know ice cube touched back,
doesn't necessarily translate change in, say shivering sweating.
information going hypothalamus integrated representation
body temperature. - sort average happening- - average. -
Across body. to, say get hot hot day Popsicles,
summer camp, went sports camp near actually, run around
like crazy. get shade could, were, Popsicles.
Popsicles. - Brain freeze. - kids putting ice cubes
other's shirts something. average, parts body aren't
exposed, mouth exposed ice Popsicle case cold cubes
hands. said, feels really good. - feels good. Yeah. - sounds like
feels deceptively good, reality still quite warm internally. -
Absolutely. Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah. can feel great dangerously
hyperthermic temperature, say get danger zone,
things get bad fast. - symptoms people
lookout hyperthermia? - Essentially, almost ironic individuals
transitioning heat stroke, actually vasoconstrict stop sweating.
pathological situation. couldn't begin explain it. essentially just
feeling exhausted. feeling miserable. heart rate high. heart rate
goes core temperature goes up, called cardiac drift. just feel rotten.
since not danger signal can translate immediately into, oop,
going heat stroke, people can overcome bad feeling
motivation continue going, work harder. there've number high profile
athletic deaths due heat stroke practice. Not competition
people really trying it,

00:31:50 Best Body Sites Cooling: Palms, Foot Pads, Upper Face

practice, shows just motivated push. - talk


magnificent portals not just humans, animals, mammals equipped with.
putting cold neck head torso not optimal,
optimal? maybe walk us theory portals
located are. can talk one might leverage
performance. - Okay, portals are, glabrous skin, big word, okay?
Glabrous just means no hair. hairless skin. say, well, body
without hair. No, body hair follicles. mammals, mammals
fur. lost fur, still hairy skin phenotype body,
except, except skin surfaces mammal relatives didn't fur.
pads feet. primates, upper part face. rabbits, no portions
ears, inner surfaces ears- - Ah, never thought that. bears,
tongue. Bears big tongues, huge tongues. [chuckles] - didn't know either.
haven't close bear yet. - Haven't leaking match bear. - Not
yet. No. - anyway, mammalian relatives can't lose heat overall body
surface. probably early mammalian evolution, evolved special
blood vessels limited surface areas don't fur. said,
blood vessels shunts arteries veins. Arteries veins
low resistance vessels. can high flow rate. Capillaries, normally
arteries veins high resistance tiny, okay? -
fair say taught blood flows arteries, capillaries,
veins, back heart. sort like heart
arteries, little capillaries, like little estuaries streams
veins, back heart. generally true? - Yeah, absolutely. -
Okay, learned basic physiology still? - still- - wouldn't get F
class? - No. - Maybe D C, not F. - excellent. - Okay.
saying glabrous beneath glabrous skin. - shunts. -
go directly arteries veins? skip capillaries- - Capillaries, yep. -
actually, long I'm, say skin, feel pads hands,
deep surface vessels reside? - the, obviously
epidermis. warm look palms hands, fairly
red backs hands aren't. don't vessels backs
hands. Now take glass, like water tumbler, right? grab it, can
see squeeze little bit, hand goes white. shut off
blood flow. - Oh, interesting. going little home experiment. -


bicycling hot day, don't want grabbing handlebars time.
want periodically. [chuckles] - Well, important. know privy really
amazing results going talk about, actually heard say
lecture recently Stanford held human performance part
of. mentioned this, cycling working hard want
able work, now know want remain cool order
continue work, get warm, bad, gripping handlebars
tightly will actually limit performance. - Right. - probably also true
Peloton kind device skier anything like that. - Right. - loosen
grip, safely can, want actually expose hands world? Now
people wearing gloves? the, just seems crazy
based everything telling me. - Well, gloves definitely impede heat loss
hands, just socks impede heat loss feet, okay? want maximize
heat loss, want thinner protectors possible hands.
course feet problematical, using certain
ways. - people run barefoot. - Yeah. Well, yeah. - Yeah. become somewhat
popular. seems like kind came went. toe shoes things,
looked ridiculous think people just willing take
performance hindrance regular shoes. - Actually track coach
Stanford famous introducing training without shoes, running. -
Interesting. - thought changed posture runner.
think just due fact increasing capacity runners lose
heat. - Interesting, yeah, heating level hands obviously going
hinder performance. running? noticed, ran cross country briefly
high school, not particularly well that, told run
holding crackers fingers something like lightly, keep hands kind
loose. running like actually beneficial performance than,
gripping phone, probably people nowadays, right? -
Right. - Interesting and- - Once, tell experience once. Alaska
winter went running absentmindedly forgot gloves.

00:38:00 Cooling Brain via Upper Face; Concussion

realized short period running, backs hands


aching cold, palms hands sweating hot. - Oh,
amazing. Amazing. compartments real thing. mentioned
upper half face- - upper part, primate ancestors don't
fur. - bottoms feet. just take moment talk
amazing results associated proper cooling glabrous
skin surfaces. - Let introduce one thing. - Sure. - asked earlier
pouring water head, okay? One things not
appreciated fully blood perfusing special blood vessels
face beard line, non-hairy skin, blood returns venous
supply heart, actually strange way. actually goes
called, blocking name now. - Take time. - blood
vessels go skull, okay? scalp bleeds lot cut
scalp. blood vessels called, want say emergent, not
emergent. word means leaving. blood vessels primarily thought
ways blood leaving brain. overheated, direction flow
blood vessels reverses. cool blood coming facial region
goes circulation actually cooling source brain. can cool
brain. can cooling effect brain pouring water head. -
Interesting, practice, we, least me, commonly associate
combat sports, fighter goes corner. usually sit stool,
unless trying mental warfare corner, case,
don't even take seat. corner crew will squeeze glove, excuse me, sponge
full cold water them, saying somewhat effective cooling
brain? - Yeah, one natural mechanisms cooling brain. - want return
point well, known benefit cooling brain terms
offsetting physical damage, offsetting negative effects concussion.
one reasons fighters will often get, back, cold item back
neck head not just cool down, theory might offset
damage neurons. - just can't comment that. aware ideas,
controversial. One things want injury brain
decrease swelling. one ways decrease swelling many parts
body cool. decreases inflammation. decreases blood flow. think
really interesting topic



00:41:25 Extraordinary (Tripling!) Performance Cooling Palms

something investigated. kind hard investigate. - Yeah,
interesting. Okay. hear stories. seen data. believe
stories. Maybe tell us story observation group made
respect anaerobic exercise proper cooling glabrous surfaces.
can talk technology. Maybe give us dips example first. - Okay. -
course, think people familiar dips. supposed to, guess- - Raise
lower body. - Yeah, raise lower body, raise lower body mass
usually legs dangling down. Sometimes people strong enough attach
weight do, essentially compound upper body exercise. - Right. -
One dip not particularly impressive people. 100
impressive. 20 impressive some, et cetera. happens skilled
athlete comes dips multiple sets. happens cool
properly using glabrous skin surface? - story occurred early
investigations first made discoveries cooling benefit increase
work volume, capacity reps, okay? word got over, think,
49ers camp. one players, Greg Clark, tight end time.
tight end Stanford. decided, don't know asked, what,
come check out. Greg came said, "Greg,
good at? activity like do?" said, "Dips. can lot dips. can
40 dips first set. can probably five sets. usual workout me."
said okay. came gym one day exactly did.
40 dips first set, maybe 25 15 down, down- - recall
roughly kind rest periods taking sets? - Yeah, standardized
rest period three minutes, set cooling
injure- - good long rest period. - Yeah. is. - still lot dips. - Yeah,
actually longer rest period many people prefer workouts. want
make time- - Not me. prefer take much rest possibly can,
yeah. - several days later came back first set, did, think, maybe 42,
little bit better, now people standing around watching. little
impetus show off. second set was, don't remember numbers,
much second set control day. cooled his- -
Okay, cooling? - sitting putting hands


devices built, cooling palms hands. - long
cooling take? Can inside three-minute rest period? - Yeah,
doing. standardized interval resting cooling three minutes,
okay. point got fifth set sets
done previous day. said, "I'm not tired. can another set."
can another set. can another set. can another set. one day two
three days later cooling, doubled total work volume. doubled total

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool

palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

last man standing, last man, last woman standing kind things. saying
somebody's hyperthermic, trick subjectively thinking
cooling off putting towel can go further, brain cook?
- Well, stop cooling,

00:26:43 Exercise-Induced Brain Fog

hot blood body core going go brain. - Interesting, well,
bit tangent, many people report long bouts exercise, even just
intense bouts exercise, feeling kind brain fog mental fatigue. assumed
due lowered brain oxygenation post-exercise, possible
post-exercise effects heating cooling brain might impact
cognition, say negatively impact cognition? - certainly possible
know rise temperature decreases cognitive capacity. mean, can
experience yourself. can get treadmill, follow temperature,
just simple activity like adding subtracting. get 39 degrees,
can't anymore. can't just calculate long
treadmill. - phrase cool, calm collected is- - Cool, calm collected. -
goal

00:27:45 Hyperthermia

pursuits. - right. - want talk portals,
mentioned times. ask portals exactly
work can leveraged performance, question
neurobiologist self can't resist, ask. thermostat preoptic area
hypothalamus, interesting me, medial preoptic area also one
known sexually dimorphic, depending testosterone exposure early life, et
cetera. Although people just note not actually testosterone creates
sexual dimorphism, differences. Actually testosterone converted
estrogen. actually estrogen effector, fascinating. Nonetheless,
got area acts thermostat. said collecting information
whole body. mean pathways, neuroscientists like
refer them, afferent input pathways body preoptic area,


map body preoptic area? 'Cause imagine can't
information just coming left shoulder, just right toe. sounds
like need pretty, probably pretty crude map, need complete map
body surface there. - Well, don't need complete map hypothalamus.
mean, thermal afferent information mentioned, also goes
somatosensory cortex. know ice cube touched back,
doesn't necessarily translate change in, say shivering sweating.
information going hypothalamus integrated representation
body temperature. - sort average happening- - average. -
Across body. to, say get hot hot day Popsicles,
summer camp, went sports camp near actually, run around
like crazy. get shade could, were, Popsicles.
Popsicles. - Brain freeze. - kids putting ice cubes
other's shirts something. average, parts body aren't
exposed, mouth exposed ice Popsicle case cold cubes
hands. said, feels really good. - feels good. Yeah. - sounds like
feels deceptively good, reality still quite warm internally. -
Absolutely. Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah. can feel great dangerously
hyperthermic temperature, say get danger zone,
things get bad fast. - symptoms people
lookout hyperthermia? - Essentially, almost ironic individuals
transitioning heat stroke, actually vasoconstrict stop sweating.
pathological situation. couldn't begin explain it. essentially just
feeling exhausted. feeling miserable. heart rate high. heart rate
goes core temperature goes up, called cardiac drift. just feel rotten.
since not danger signal can translate immediately into, oop,
going heat stroke, people can overcome bad feeling
motivation continue going, work harder. there've number high profile
athletic deaths due heat stroke practice. Not competition
people really trying it,

00:31:50 Best Body Sites Cooling: Palms, Foot Pads, Upper Face

practice, shows just motivated push. - talk


magnificent portals not just humans, animals, mammals equipped with.
putting cold neck head torso not optimal,
optimal? maybe walk us theory portals
located are. can talk one might leverage
performance. - Okay, portals are, glabrous skin, big word, okay?
Glabrous just means no hair. hairless skin. say, well, body
without hair. No, body hair follicles. mammals, mammals
fur. lost fur, still hairy skin phenotype body,
except, except skin surfaces mammal relatives didn't fur.
pads feet. primates, upper part face. rabbits, no portions
ears, inner surfaces ears- - Ah, never thought that. bears,
tongue. Bears big tongues, huge tongues. [chuckles] - didn't know either.
haven't close bear yet. - Haven't leaking match bear. - Not
yet. No. - anyway, mammalian relatives can't lose heat overall body
surface. probably early mammalian evolution, evolved special
blood vessels limited surface areas don't fur. said,
blood vessels shunts arteries veins. Arteries veins
low resistance vessels. can high flow rate. Capillaries, normally
arteries veins high resistance tiny, okay? -
fair say taught blood flows arteries, capillaries,
veins, back heart. sort like heart
arteries, little capillaries, like little estuaries streams
veins, back heart. generally true? - Yeah, absolutely. -
Okay, learned basic physiology still? - still- - wouldn't get F
class? - No. - Maybe D C, not F. - excellent. - Okay.
saying glabrous beneath glabrous skin. - shunts. -
go directly arteries veins? skip capillaries- - Capillaries, yep. -
actually, long I'm, say skin, feel pads hands,
deep surface vessels reside? - the, obviously
epidermis. warm look palms hands, fairly
red backs hands aren't. don't vessels backs
hands. Now take glass, like water tumbler, right? grab it, can
see squeeze little bit, hand goes white. shut off
blood flow. - Oh, interesting. going little home experiment. -


bicycling hot day, don't want grabbing handlebars time.
want periodically. [chuckles] - Well, important. know privy really
amazing results going talk about, actually heard say
lecture recently Stanford held human performance part
of. mentioned this, cycling working hard want
able work, now know want remain cool order
continue work, get warm, bad, gripping handlebars
tightly will actually limit performance. - Right. - probably also true
Peloton kind device skier anything like that. - Right. - loosen
grip, safely can, want actually expose hands world? Now
people wearing gloves? the, just seems crazy
based everything telling me. - Well, gloves definitely impede heat loss
hands, just socks impede heat loss feet, okay? want maximize
heat loss, want thinner protectors possible hands.
course feet problematical, using certain
ways. - people run barefoot. - Yeah. Well, yeah. - Yeah. become somewhat
popular. seems like kind came went. toe shoes things,
looked ridiculous think people just willing take
performance hindrance regular shoes. - Actually track coach
Stanford famous introducing training without shoes, running. -
Interesting. - thought changed posture runner.
think just due fact increasing capacity runners lose
heat. - Interesting, yeah, heating level hands obviously going
hinder performance. running? noticed, ran cross country briefly
high school, not particularly well that, told run
holding crackers fingers something like lightly, keep hands kind
loose. running like actually beneficial performance than,
gripping phone, probably people nowadays, right? -
Right. - Interesting and- - Once, tell experience once. Alaska
winter went running absentmindedly forgot gloves.

00:38:00 Cooling Brain via Upper Face; Concussion

realized short period running, backs hands


aching cold, palms hands sweating hot. - Oh,
amazing. Amazing. compartments real thing. mentioned
upper half face- - upper part, primate ancestors don't
fur. - bottoms feet. just take moment talk
amazing results associated proper cooling glabrous
skin surfaces. - Let introduce one thing. - Sure. - asked earlier
pouring water head, okay? One things not
appreciated fully blood perfusing special blood vessels
face beard line, non-hairy skin, blood returns venous
supply heart, actually strange way. actually goes
called, blocking name now. - Take time. - blood
vessels go skull, okay? scalp bleeds lot cut
scalp. blood vessels called, want say emergent, not
emergent. word means leaving. blood vessels primarily thought
ways blood leaving brain. overheated, direction flow
blood vessels reverses. cool blood coming facial region
goes circulation actually cooling source brain. can cool
brain. can cooling effect brain pouring water head. -
Interesting, practice, we, least me, commonly associate
combat sports, fighter goes corner. usually sit stool,
unless trying mental warfare corner, case,
don't even take seat. corner crew will squeeze glove, excuse me, sponge
full cold water them, saying somewhat effective cooling
brain? - Yeah, one natural mechanisms cooling brain. - want return
point well, known benefit cooling brain terms
offsetting physical damage, offsetting negative effects concussion.
one reasons fighters will often get, back, cold item back
neck head not just cool down, theory might offset
damage neurons. - just can't comment that. aware ideas,
controversial. One things want injury brain
decrease swelling. one ways decrease swelling many parts
body cool. decreases inflammation. decreases blood flow. think
really interesting topic



00:41:25 Extraordinary (Tripling!) Performance Cooling Palms

something investigated. kind hard investigate. - Yeah,
interesting. Okay. hear stories. seen data. believe
stories. Maybe tell us story observation group made
respect anaerobic exercise proper cooling glabrous surfaces.
can talk technology. Maybe give us dips example first. - Okay. -
course, think people familiar dips. supposed to, guess- - Raise
lower body. - Yeah, raise lower body, raise lower body mass
usually legs dangling down. Sometimes people strong enough attach
weight do, essentially compound upper body exercise. - Right. -
One dip not particularly impressive people. 100
impressive. 20 impressive some, et cetera. happens skilled
athlete comes dips multiple sets. happens cool
properly using glabrous skin surface? - story occurred early
investigations first made discoveries cooling benefit increase
work volume, capacity reps, okay? word got over, think,
49ers camp. one players, Greg Clark, tight end time.
tight end Stanford. decided, don't know asked, what,
come check out. Greg came said, "Greg,
good at? activity like do?" said, "Dips. can lot dips. can
40 dips first set. can probably five sets. usual workout me."
said okay. came gym one day exactly did.
40 dips first set, maybe 25 15 down, down- - recall
roughly kind rest periods taking sets? - Yeah, standardized
rest period three minutes, set cooling
injure- - good long rest period. - Yeah. is. - still lot dips. - Yeah,
actually longer rest period many people prefer workouts. want
make time- - Not me. prefer take much rest possibly can,
yeah. - several days later came back first set, did, think, maybe 42,
little bit better, now people standing around watching. little
impetus show off. second set was, don't remember numbers,
much second set control day. cooled his- -
Okay, cooling? - sitting putting hands


devices built, cooling palms hands. - long
cooling take? Can inside three-minute rest period? - Yeah,
doing. standardized interval resting cooling three minutes,
okay. point got fifth set sets
done previous day. said, "I'm not tired. can another set."
can another set. can another set. can another set. one day two
three days later cooling, doubled total work volume. doubled total
number dips. - adding sets repetitions set? - Right,
kept coming back four weeks, twice week. end month,
300 dips. - Wow. percent- - tripled. - tripled. - Tripled,
professional athlete

00:45:35 Enhancing Recovery, Eliminating Soreness w/Intra-workout Cooling

peak physical conditioning, triples can do. - Amazing, terms
ability recover, explored discussed all? understanding
cause enough stress muscle anaerobic training, provide
stimulus compensatory regrowth, et cetera, work, essentially
scale amount recovery needed recovery time. curious
whether not needed longer recover super-performing
workouts? - interesting. major discovery, didn't realize
making time. phenomenon referring delayed
onset muscle soreness, DOMS. due little micro tares, forth,
happening extend workout capacity volume, okay?
experience many times athlete anyone will come lab will
exceed previous goals were, previous expectations. can always
see words coming mouth, "I'm going sore tomorrow." never
are. - Interesting. - actually demonstrated naive group.
class, physical conditioning class. half the, first days class,
establish true capacity, do. pretty heavy
workouts new recruits. gave half benefit cooling
half not. record subjective levels delayed onset
muscle soreness. cool, didn't significant muscle soreness. -
Amazing, know also published results, will provide links


papers people seeing similar effects, say, similar performance
enhancing effects, using bench presses, bench press, pushups, sorts
things. Maybe give us example realm endurance work
aerobic work, running, cycling, things sort. - Well, one problems with,
us, equipment now not really portable. mean, portable sense
can carry gym football field. - not going run run
it. - not going run it, right. - equip bicycle it. Although
cooling handles bicycles coming? - good, one itinerant
activity golfing. people put golf carts, and- - people really heat
much golf? - do. - Not disparaging golfers, way
conceptualize golf, like swing walk cart ride meal.
probably just offended golfers there. - Well, one time work
Department Defense. wanted check out, whether not
really worthwhile. sent team special ops soldiers
subjects test out. week. fun week. -
Yeah, work guys. hard driving guys. also know
fun. yeah, definitely have, off quit switch, buried
deep within nervous system. don't like hit quit switch. - guy
wrote final report, gave addendum report said, "Well, tell
this. gotten home, added technology," took technology
them. wanted keep it. - Oh, Yeah. sounds right. - using it,
added 20 yards every club bag. no effin' small deal. - Wow,
allowing people hit further, hit golf ball further? - Right. [chuckles] - Interesting.
right. golf players there, reward get back Craig
little knocks golf.

00:50:00 Multiple Sclerosis: Heat Sensitivity & Amelioration Cooling

don't knock golf. just don't think sport heating
limiting factor. since getting drive, think's going
there? - Well, can heating up. - wear gloves, right? -
wearing glove hot day, forth. let just tell one serious story
golfers individuals multiple sclerosis exceedingly temperature-
sensitive. - didn't know that. - may still mobile, stay cool


locations not increase exercise great extent. subjects
multiple sclerosis just essentially put device golf cart
back playing golf middle summer. - Oh, great. - Yeah. -
great. Anything allows people normal levels livelihood recreation
great. always think performance kinds like peak elite levels
pushing harder, yeah,

00:51:00 Enhancing Endurance Proper Cooling

anything allows people mobile functional great. favorite
example endurance, feel free give us extreme one talk
averages make sure thorough averages versus exceptions. - Right.
haven't done lot field. mean outdoors. endurance hot
room treadmill work, forth. first experiment had, think,
maybe 18 subjects just off street. Maybe just recruited people hallways,
come this. found could, group one trial
without cooling, double endurance, walking treadmill, walking
uphill treadmill heat, like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature, 40
degrees centigrade. - experiment look like? people walk
incline. really warm. people just going hit quit button say,
enough get off treadmill proper cooling.
cooling? - continuously. - see. - laboratory, can
suspend devices ceiling, example. Now prototype wearable
devices. response emails Ebola workers number years ago
Sierra Leone. said, "We've read work athletes. Can't
something us? mean, personal protective gear, can't
hot zone 15 20 minutes." started us challenge
developing wearable systems go PPE. published work
now, but-. - great, guessing military special operators
desert locations probably excited technology. - Well,
get it. - get. coming, coming. Yeah, think people might
wonder, studies

00:53:00 Cool Mitt, Ice-Cold Cold, 3 Minutes Cooling



incredible results years haven't heard
it? will ask opinion well. just editorialize little bit.
best laboratory work practical applications oftentimes requires many
studies. oftentimes isn't portal, speak, get information
technology sector. company developing technology
people use, purchase use. might well just tell us now, name
company? website? People going want know
can get magical technology? poor man's version well? -
Well, company Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A, website www.coolmitt.com.
CoolMitt just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com - great website. went there,
says right now, technology available professional sports teams
military. true? - Well, stand now new version technology
sort beta test versions. got hands people used
technology before. NFL teams using. college teams.
Olympics. Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball, NBA, National
Tennis Association. locations now trying reporting
back, working? change it? improve it?
forth. are. website, can actually sign one
will able get one [chuckles] finally manufactured. now
made fairly small lots, want change things realize
can improved. - Yeah. Stanford all. want get technology right.
like joke one reasons like Stanford much that, not
colleagues amazing forward thinking, perfectionists.
perfectionist mindset perfect can go live,
speak. Well, think will lot interest. talk technology little
detail moment. talk whether not cruder forms
technology exist either sake safety and/or performance. is, CoolMitt,
understand mitt, glove. put hand into, hold
surface. surface cools hand thereby specialized portal,
cools core body temperature muscles body. Subjectively,
right now, think ice cold think just cool? -
Just cool. - see. - Ice cold cold. people always ask, well, can't just
stick hand bucket ice water? cold. causes


reflex, vasoconstriction portals trying maximize heat loss
from. stick hand cold water, comes out, cold. - just
sealed heat body. - Yeah. Right, sort recommended
someone one point, said, "Well, running, can't just carry frozen juice
can, will gradually melt?" said, "Well, no, going decrease
heat loss hand. every couple minutes switched hands, [chuckles]
might work. - Well, feeling people now well
trying this. long, CoolMitt proper temperature, long people
putting hands Mitt? - We, again, just standardized three
minutes. part reason rate heat loss exponentially
declining curve, okay? three minutes sort gets best part curve.
can go longer get benefit, biggest bang buck first two,
three minutes. - Okay, mentioned number impressive organizations, sports
teams, military using this. not something typically see
sidelines games. Although honest, haven't looked carefully. guessing
probably keeping technology somewhat wraps. Where,
this? running back locker room? mean, military
special operators thing, terms athletes, possible,
hypothetically, athletes somewhat incognito? - possible, really
don't know. People mentioned Stanford, don't see football team
using it. Well, football team Stanford mostly playing cold weather, cool
weather. night games cool. Even day games not hot frequently here.
go hot place like Arizona Utah, least coach,

00:58:20 Can Use Palmer Cooling Enhance Performance

Shaw, says take find benefit.
use it. - Interesting, poor person's, poor man woman's version
this? mentioned juice can passing back forth. mentioned cooling
hands. number people said learning little bit science
technology experienced big effects, positive effects cooling by,
confess, done this, taking package frozen blueberries, just kind passing
back forth hands. Now talking you, realize probably didn't
long enough. probably was, maybe 30 seconds passing back


forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

map body preoptic area? 'Cause imagine can't
information just coming left shoulder, just right toe. sounds
like need pretty, probably pretty crude map, need complete map
body surface there. - Well, don't need complete map hypothalamus.
mean, thermal afferent information mentioned, also goes
somatosensory cortex. know ice cube touched back,
doesn't necessarily translate change in, say shivering sweating.
information going hypothalamus integrated representation
body temperature. - sort average happening- - average. -
Across body. to, say get hot hot day Popsicles,
summer camp, went sports camp near actually, run around
like crazy. get shade could, were, Popsicles.
Popsicles. - Brain freeze. - kids putting ice cubes
other's shirts something. average, parts body aren't
exposed, mouth exposed ice Popsicle case cold cubes
hands. said, feels really good. - feels good. Yeah. - sounds like
feels deceptively good, reality still quite warm internally. -
Absolutely. Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah. can feel great dangerously
hyperthermic temperature, say get danger zone,
things get bad fast. - symptoms people
lookout hyperthermia? - Essentially, almost ironic individuals
transitioning heat stroke, actually vasoconstrict stop sweating.
pathological situation. couldn't begin explain it. essentially just
feeling exhausted. feeling miserable. heart rate high. heart rate
goes core temperature goes up, called cardiac drift. just feel rotten.
since not danger signal can translate immediately into, oop,
going heat stroke, people can overcome bad feeling
motivation continue going, work harder. there've number high profile
athletic deaths due heat stroke practice. Not competition
people really trying it,

00:31:50 Best Body Sites Cooling: Palms, Foot Pads, Upper Face

practice, shows just motivated push. - talk


magnificent portals not just humans, animals, mammals equipped with.
putting cold neck head torso not optimal,
optimal? maybe walk us theory portals
located are. can talk one might leverage
performance. - Okay, portals are, glabrous skin, big word, okay?
Glabrous just means no hair. hairless skin. say, well, body
without hair. No, body hair follicles. mammals, mammals
fur. lost fur, still hairy skin phenotype body,
except, except skin surfaces mammal relatives didn't fur.
pads feet. primates, upper part face. rabbits, no portions
ears, inner surfaces ears- - Ah, never thought that. bears,
tongue. Bears big tongues, huge tongues. [chuckles] - didn't know either.
haven't close bear yet. - Haven't leaking match bear. - Not
yet. No. - anyway, mammalian relatives can't lose heat overall body
surface. probably early mammalian evolution, evolved special
blood vessels limited surface areas don't fur. said,
blood vessels shunts arteries veins. Arteries veins
low resistance vessels. can high flow rate. Capillaries, normally
arteries veins high resistance tiny, okay? -
fair say taught blood flows arteries, capillaries,
veins, back heart. sort like heart
arteries, little capillaries, like little estuaries streams
veins, back heart. generally true? - Yeah, absolutely. -
Okay, learned basic physiology still? - still- - wouldn't get F
class? - No. - Maybe D C, not F. - excellent. - Okay.
saying glabrous beneath glabrous skin. - shunts. -
go directly arteries veins? skip capillaries- - Capillaries, yep. -
actually, long I'm, say skin, feel pads hands,
deep surface vessels reside? - the, obviously
epidermis. warm look palms hands, fairly
red backs hands aren't. don't vessels backs
hands. Now take glass, like water tumbler, right? grab it, can
see squeeze little bit, hand goes white. shut off
blood flow. - Oh, interesting. going little home experiment. -


bicycling hot day, don't want grabbing handlebars time.
want periodically. [chuckles] - Well, important. know privy really
amazing results going talk about, actually heard say
lecture recently Stanford held human performance part
of. mentioned this, cycling working hard want
able work, now know want remain cool order
continue work, get warm, bad, gripping handlebars
tightly will actually limit performance. - Right. - probably also true
Peloton kind device skier anything like that. - Right. - loosen
grip, safely can, want actually expose hands world? Now
people wearing gloves? the, just seems crazy
based everything telling me. - Well, gloves definitely impede heat loss
hands, just socks impede heat loss feet, okay? want maximize
heat loss, want thinner protectors possible hands.
course feet problematical, using certain
ways. - people run barefoot. - Yeah. Well, yeah. - Yeah. become somewhat
popular. seems like kind came went. toe shoes things,
looked ridiculous think people just willing take
performance hindrance regular shoes. - Actually track coach
Stanford famous introducing training without shoes, running. -
Interesting. - thought changed posture runner.
think just due fact increasing capacity runners lose
heat. - Interesting, yeah, heating level hands obviously going
hinder performance. running? noticed, ran cross country briefly
high school, not particularly well that, told run
holding crackers fingers something like lightly, keep hands kind
loose. running like actually beneficial performance than,
gripping phone, probably people nowadays, right? -
Right. - Interesting and- - Once, tell experience once. Alaska
winter went running absentmindedly forgot gloves.

00:38:00 Cooling Brain via Upper Face; Concussion

realized short period running, backs hands


aching cold, palms hands sweating hot. - Oh,
amazing. Amazing. compartments real thing. mentioned
upper half face- - upper part, primate ancestors don't
fur. - bottoms feet. just take moment talk
amazing results associated proper cooling glabrous
skin surfaces. - Let introduce one thing. - Sure. - asked earlier
pouring water head, okay? One things not
appreciated fully blood perfusing special blood vessels
face beard line, non-hairy skin, blood returns venous
supply heart, actually strange way. actually goes
called, blocking name now. - Take time. - blood
vessels go skull, okay? scalp bleeds lot cut
scalp. blood vessels called, want say emergent, not
emergent. word means leaving. blood vessels primarily thought
ways blood leaving brain. overheated, direction flow
blood vessels reverses. cool blood coming facial region
goes circulation actually cooling source brain. can cool
brain. can cooling effect brain pouring water head. -
Interesting, practice, we, least me, commonly associate
combat sports, fighter goes corner. usually sit stool,
unless trying mental warfare corner, case,
don't even take seat. corner crew will squeeze glove, excuse me, sponge
full cold water them, saying somewhat effective cooling
brain? - Yeah, one natural mechanisms cooling brain. - want return
point well, known benefit cooling brain terms
offsetting physical damage, offsetting negative effects concussion.
one reasons fighters will often get, back, cold item back
neck head not just cool down, theory might offset
damage neurons. - just can't comment that. aware ideas,
controversial. One things want injury brain
decrease swelling. one ways decrease swelling many parts
body cool. decreases inflammation. decreases blood flow. think
really interesting topic



00:41:25 Extraordinary (Tripling!) Performance Cooling Palms

something investigated. kind hard investigate. - Yeah,
interesting. Okay. hear stories. seen data. believe
stories. Maybe tell us story observation group made
respect anaerobic exercise proper cooling glabrous surfaces.
can talk technology. Maybe give us dips example first. - Okay. -
course, think people familiar dips. supposed to, guess- - Raise
lower body. - Yeah, raise lower body, raise lower body mass
usually legs dangling down. Sometimes people strong enough attach
weight do, essentially compound upper body exercise. - Right. -
One dip not particularly impressive people. 100
impressive. 20 impressive some, et cetera. happens skilled
athlete comes dips multiple sets. happens cool
properly using glabrous skin surface? - story occurred early
investigations first made discoveries cooling benefit increase
work volume, capacity reps, okay? word got over, think,
49ers camp. one players, Greg Clark, tight end time.
tight end Stanford. decided, don't know asked, what,
come check out. Greg came said, "Greg,
good at? activity like do?" said, "Dips. can lot dips. can
40 dips first set. can probably five sets. usual workout me."
said okay. came gym one day exactly did.
40 dips first set, maybe 25 15 down, down- - recall
roughly kind rest periods taking sets? - Yeah, standardized
rest period three minutes, set cooling

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high

really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

magnificent portals not just humans, animals, mammals equipped with.
putting cold neck head torso not optimal,
optimal? maybe walk us theory portals
located are. can talk one might leverage
performance. - Okay, portals are, glabrous skin, big word, okay?
Glabrous just means no hair. hairless skin. say, well, body
without hair. No, body hair follicles. mammals, mammals
fur. lost fur, still hairy skin phenotype body,
except, except skin surfaces mammal relatives didn't fur.
pads feet. primates, upper part face. rabbits, no portions
ears, inner surfaces ears- - Ah, never thought that. bears,
tongue. Bears big tongues, huge tongues. [chuckles] - didn't know either.
haven't close bear yet. - Haven't leaking match bear. - Not
yet. No. - anyway, mammalian relatives can't lose heat overall body
surface. probably early mammalian evolution, evolved special
blood vessels limited surface areas don't fur. said,
blood vessels shunts arteries veins. Arteries veins
low resistance vessels. can high flow rate. Capillaries, normally
arteries veins high resistance tiny, okay? -
fair say taught blood flows arteries, capillaries,
veins, back heart. sort like heart
arteries, little capillaries, like little estuaries streams
veins, back heart. generally true? - Yeah, absolutely. -
Okay, learned basic physiology still? - still- - wouldn't get F
class? - No. - Maybe D C, not F. - excellent. - Okay.
saying glabrous beneath glabrous skin. - shunts. -
go directly arteries veins? skip capillaries- - Capillaries, yep. -
actually, long I'm, say skin, feel pads hands,
deep surface vessels reside? - the, obviously
epidermis. warm look palms hands, fairly
red backs hands aren't. don't vessels backs
hands. Now take glass, like water tumbler, right? grab it, can
see squeeze little bit, hand goes white. shut off
blood flow. - Oh, interesting. going little home experiment. -


bicycling hot day, don't want grabbing handlebars time.
want periodically. [chuckles] - Well, important. know privy really
amazing results going talk about, actually heard say
lecture recently Stanford held human performance part
of. mentioned this, cycling working hard want
able work, now know want remain cool order
continue work, get warm, bad, gripping handlebars
tightly will actually limit performance. - Right. - probably also true
Peloton kind device skier anything like that. - Right. - loosen
grip, safely can, want actually expose hands world? Now
people wearing gloves? the, just seems crazy
based everything telling me. - Well, gloves definitely impede heat loss
hands, just socks impede heat loss feet, okay? want maximize
heat loss, want thinner protectors possible hands.
course feet problematical, using certain
ways. - people run barefoot. - Yeah. Well, yeah. - Yeah. become somewhat
popular. seems like kind came went. toe shoes things,
looked ridiculous think people just willing take
performance hindrance regular shoes. - Actually track coach
Stanford famous introducing training without shoes, running. -
Interesting. - thought changed posture runner.
think just due fact increasing capacity runners lose
heat. - Interesting, yeah, heating level hands obviously going
hinder performance. running? noticed, ran cross country briefly
high school, not particularly well that, told run
holding crackers fingers something like lightly, keep hands kind
loose. running like actually beneficial performance than,
gripping phone, probably people nowadays, right? -
Right. - Interesting and- - Once, tell experience once. Alaska
winter went running absentmindedly forgot gloves.

00:38:00 Cooling Brain via Upper Face; Concussion

realized short period running, backs hands


aching cold, palms hands sweating hot. - Oh,
amazing. Amazing. compartments real thing. mentioned
upper half face- - upper part, primate ancestors don't
fur. - bottoms feet. just take moment talk
amazing results associated proper cooling glabrous
skin surfaces. - Let introduce one thing. - Sure. - asked earlier
pouring water head, okay? One things not
appreciated fully blood perfusing special blood vessels
face beard line, non-hairy skin, blood returns venous
supply heart, actually strange way. actually goes
called, blocking name now. - Take time. - blood
vessels go skull, okay? scalp bleeds lot cut
scalp. blood vessels called, want say emergent, not
emergent. word means leaving. blood vessels primarily thought
ways blood leaving brain. overheated, direction flow
blood vessels reverses. cool blood coming facial region
goes circulation actually cooling source brain. can cool
brain. can cooling effect brain pouring water head. -
Interesting, practice, we, least me, commonly associate
combat sports, fighter goes corner. usually sit stool,
unless trying mental warfare corner, case,
don't even take seat. corner crew will squeeze glove, excuse me, sponge
full cold water them, saying somewhat effective cooling
brain? - Yeah, one natural mechanisms cooling brain. - want return
point well, known benefit cooling brain terms
offsetting physical damage, offsetting negative effects concussion.
one reasons fighters will often get, back, cold item back
neck head not just cool down, theory might offset
damage neurons. - just can't comment that. aware ideas,
controversial. One things want injury brain
decrease swelling. one ways decrease swelling many parts
body cool. decreases inflammation. decreases blood flow. think
really interesting topic



00:41:25 Extraordinary (Tripling!) Performance Cooling Palms

something investigated. kind hard investigate. - Yeah,
interesting. Okay. hear stories. seen data. believe
stories. Maybe tell us story observation group made
respect anaerobic exercise proper cooling glabrous surfaces.
can talk technology. Maybe give us dips example first. - Okay. -
course, think people familiar dips. supposed to, guess- - Raise
lower body. - Yeah, raise lower body, raise lower body mass
usually legs dangling down. Sometimes people strong enough attach
weight do, essentially compound upper body exercise. - Right. -
One dip not particularly impressive people. 100
impressive. 20 impressive some, et cetera. happens skilled
athlete comes dips multiple sets. happens cool
properly using glabrous skin surface? - story occurred early
investigations first made discoveries cooling benefit increase
work volume, capacity reps, okay? word got over, think,
49ers camp. one players, Greg Clark, tight end time.
tight end Stanford. decided, don't know asked, what,
come check out. Greg came said, "Greg,
good at? activity like do?" said, "Dips. can lot dips. can
40 dips first set. can probably five sets. usual workout me."
said okay. came gym one day exactly did.
40 dips first set, maybe 25 15 down, down- - recall
roughly kind rest periods taking sets? - Yeah, standardized
rest period three minutes, set cooling
injure- - good long rest period. - Yeah. is. - still lot dips. - Yeah,
actually longer rest period many people prefer workouts. want
make time- - Not me. prefer take much rest possibly can,
yeah. - several days later came back first set, did, think, maybe 42,
little bit better, now people standing around watching. little
impetus show off. second set was, don't remember numbers,
much second set control day. cooled his- -
Okay, cooling? - sitting putting hands


devices built, cooling palms hands. - long
cooling take? Can inside three-minute rest period? - Yeah,
doing. standardized interval resting cooling three minutes,
okay. point got fifth set sets
done previous day. said, "I'm not tired. can another set."
can another set. can another set. can another set. one day two
three days later cooling, doubled total work volume. doubled total
number dips. - adding sets repetitions set? - Right,
kept coming back four weeks, twice week. end month,
300 dips. - Wow. percent- - tripled. - tripled. - Tripled,
professional athlete

00:45:35 Enhancing Recovery, Eliminating Soreness w/Intra-workout Cooling

peak physical conditioning, triples can do. - Amazing, terms
ability recover, explored discussed all? understanding
cause enough stress muscle anaerobic training, provide
stimulus compensatory regrowth, et cetera, work, essentially
scale amount recovery needed recovery time. curious
whether not needed longer recover super-performing
workouts? - interesting. major discovery, didn't realize
making time. phenomenon referring delayed
onset muscle soreness, DOMS. due little micro tares, forth,
happening extend workout capacity volume, okay?
experience many times athlete anyone will come lab will
exceed previous goals were, previous expectations. can always
see words coming mouth, "I'm going sore tomorrow." never
are. - Interesting. - actually demonstrated naive group.
class, physical conditioning class. half the, first days class,
establish true capacity, do. pretty heavy
workouts new recruits. gave half benefit cooling
half not. record subjective levels delayed onset
muscle soreness. cool, didn't significant muscle soreness. -
Amazing, know also published results, will provide links


papers people seeing similar effects, say, similar performance
enhancing effects, using bench presses, bench press, pushups, sorts
things. Maybe give us example realm endurance work
aerobic work, running, cycling, things sort. - Well, one problems with,
us, equipment now not really portable. mean, portable sense
can carry gym football field. - not going run run
it. - not going run it, right. - equip bicycle it. Although
cooling handles bicycles coming? - good, one itinerant
activity golfing. people put golf carts, and- - people really heat
much golf? - do. - Not disparaging golfers, way
conceptualize golf, like swing walk cart ride meal.
probably just offended golfers there. - Well, one time work
Department Defense. wanted check out, whether not
really worthwhile. sent team special ops soldiers
subjects test out. week. fun week. -
Yeah, work guys. hard driving guys. also know
fun. yeah, definitely have, off quit switch, buried
deep within nervous system. don't like hit quit switch. - guy
wrote final report, gave addendum report said, "Well, tell
this. gotten home, added technology," took technology
them. wanted keep it. - Oh, Yeah. sounds right. - using it,
added 20 yards every club bag. no effin' small deal. - Wow,
allowing people hit further, hit golf ball further? - Right. [chuckles] - Interesting.
right. golf players there, reward get back Craig
little knocks golf.

00:50:00 Multiple Sclerosis: Heat Sensitivity & Amelioration Cooling

don't knock golf. just don't think sport heating
limiting factor. since getting drive, think's going
there? - Well, can heating up. - wear gloves, right? -
wearing glove hot day, forth. let just tell one serious story
golfers individuals multiple sclerosis exceedingly temperature-
sensitive. - didn't know that. - may still mobile, stay cool


locations not increase exercise great extent. subjects
multiple sclerosis just essentially put device golf cart
back playing golf middle summer. - Oh, great. - Yeah. -
great. Anything allows people normal levels livelihood recreation
great. always think performance kinds like peak elite levels
pushing harder, yeah,

00:51:00 Enhancing Endurance Proper Cooling

anything allows people mobile functional great. favorite
example endurance, feel free give us extreme one talk
averages make sure thorough averages versus exceptions. - Right.
haven't done lot field. mean outdoors. endurance hot
room treadmill work, forth. first experiment had, think,
maybe 18 subjects just off street. Maybe just recruited people hallways,
come this. found could, group one trial
without cooling, double endurance, walking treadmill, walking
uphill treadmill heat, like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature, 40
degrees centigrade. - experiment look like? people walk
incline. really warm. people just going hit quit button say,
enough get off treadmill proper cooling.
cooling? - continuously. - see. - laboratory, can
suspend devices ceiling, example. Now prototype wearable
devices. response emails Ebola workers number years ago
Sierra Leone. said, "We've read work athletes. Can't
something us? mean, personal protective gear, can't
hot zone 15 20 minutes." started us challenge
developing wearable systems go PPE. published work
now, but-. - great, guessing military special operators
desert locations probably excited technology. - Well,
get it. - get. coming, coming. Yeah, think people might
wonder, studies

00:53:00 Cool Mitt, Ice-Cold Cold, 3 Minutes Cooling



incredible results years haven't heard
it? will ask opinion well. just editorialize little bit.
best laboratory work practical applications oftentimes requires many
studies. oftentimes isn't portal, speak, get information
technology sector. company developing technology
people use, purchase use. might well just tell us now, name
company? website? People going want know
can get magical technology? poor man's version well? -
Well, company Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A, website www.coolmitt.com.
CoolMitt just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com - great website. went there,
says right now, technology available professional sports teams
military. true? - Well, stand now new version technology
sort beta test versions. got hands people used
technology before. NFL teams using. college teams.
Olympics. Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball, NBA, National
Tennis Association. locations now trying reporting
back, working? change it? improve it?
forth. are. website, can actually sign one
will able get one [chuckles] finally manufactured. now
made fairly small lots, want change things realize
can improved. - Yeah. Stanford all. want get technology right.
like joke one reasons like Stanford much that, not
colleagues amazing forward thinking, perfectionists.
perfectionist mindset perfect can go live,
speak. Well, think will lot interest. talk technology little
detail moment. talk whether not cruder forms
technology exist either sake safety and/or performance. is, CoolMitt,
understand mitt, glove. put hand into, hold
surface. surface cools hand thereby specialized portal,
cools core body temperature muscles body. Subjectively,
right now, think ice cold think just cool? -
Just cool. - see. - Ice cold cold. people always ask, well, can't just
stick hand bucket ice water? cold. causes


reflex, vasoconstriction portals trying maximize heat loss
from. stick hand cold water, comes out, cold. - just
sealed heat body. - Yeah. Right, sort recommended
someone one point, said, "Well, running, can't just carry frozen juice
can, will gradually melt?" said, "Well, no, going decrease
heat loss hand. every couple minutes switched hands, [chuckles]
might work. - Well, feeling people now well
trying this. long, CoolMitt proper temperature, long people
putting hands Mitt? - We, again, just standardized three
minutes. part reason rate heat loss exponentially
declining curve, okay? three minutes sort gets best part curve.
can go longer get benefit, biggest bang buck first two,
three minutes. - Okay, mentioned number impressive organizations, sports
teams, military using this. not something typically see
sidelines games. Although honest, haven't looked carefully. guessing
probably keeping technology somewhat wraps. Where,
this? running back locker room? mean, military
special operators thing, terms athletes, possible,
hypothetically, athletes somewhat incognito? - possible, really
don't know. People mentioned Stanford, don't see football team
using it. Well, football team Stanford mostly playing cold weather, cool
weather. night games cool. Even day games not hot frequently here.
go hot place like Arizona Utah, least coach,

00:58:20 Can Use Palmer Cooling Enhance Performance

Shaw, says take find benefit.
use it. - Interesting, poor person's, poor man woman's version
this? mentioned juice can passing back forth. mentioned cooling
hands. number people said learning little bit science
technology experienced big effects, positive effects cooling by,
confess, done this, taking package frozen blueberries, just kind passing
back forth hands. Now talking you, realize probably didn't
long enough. probably was, maybe 30 seconds passing back


forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

bicycling hot day, don't want grabbing handlebars time.
want periodically. [chuckles] - Well, important. know privy really
amazing results going talk about, actually heard say
lecture recently Stanford held human performance part
of. mentioned this, cycling working hard want
able work, now know want remain cool order
continue work, get warm, bad, gripping handlebars
tightly will actually limit performance. - Right. - probably also true
Peloton kind device skier anything like that. - Right. - loosen
grip, safely can, want actually expose hands world? Now
people wearing gloves? the, just seems crazy
based everything telling me. - Well, gloves definitely impede heat loss
hands, just socks impede heat loss feet, okay? want maximize
heat loss, want thinner protectors possible hands.
course feet problematical, using certain
ways. - people run barefoot. - Yeah. Well, yeah. - Yeah. become somewhat
popular. seems like kind came went. toe shoes things,
looked ridiculous think people just willing take
performance hindrance regular shoes. - Actually track coach
Stanford famous introducing training without shoes, running. -
Interesting. - thought changed posture runner.
think just due fact increasing capacity runners lose
heat. - Interesting, yeah, heating level hands obviously going
hinder performance. running? noticed, ran cross country briefly
high school, not particularly well that, told run
holding crackers fingers something like lightly, keep hands kind
loose. running like actually beneficial performance than,
gripping phone, probably people nowadays, right? -
Right. - Interesting and- - Once, tell experience once. Alaska
winter went running absentmindedly forgot gloves.

00:38:00 Cooling Brain via Upper Face; Concussion

realized short period running, backs hands


aching cold, palms hands sweating hot. - Oh,
amazing. Amazing. compartments real thing. mentioned
upper half face- - upper part, primate ancestors don't
fur. - bottoms feet. just take moment talk
amazing results associated proper cooling glabrous
skin surfaces. - Let introduce one thing. - Sure. - asked earlier
pouring water head, okay? One things not
appreciated fully blood perfusing special blood vessels
face beard line, non-hairy skin, blood returns venous
supply heart, actually strange way. actually goes
called, blocking name now. - Take time. - blood
vessels go skull, okay? scalp bleeds lot cut
scalp. blood vessels called, want say emergent, not
emergent. word means leaving. blood vessels primarily thought
ways blood leaving brain. overheated, direction flow
blood vessels reverses. cool blood coming facial region
goes circulation actually cooling source brain. can cool
brain. can cooling effect brain pouring water head. -
Interesting, practice, we, least me, commonly associate
combat sports, fighter goes corner. usually sit stool,
unless trying mental warfare corner, case,
don't even take seat. corner crew will squeeze glove, excuse me, sponge
full cold water them, saying somewhat effective cooling
brain? - Yeah, one natural mechanisms cooling brain. - want return
point well, known benefit cooling brain terms
offsetting physical damage, offsetting negative effects concussion.
one reasons fighters will often get, back, cold item back
neck head not just cool down, theory might offset
damage neurons. - just can't comment that. aware ideas,
controversial. One things want injury brain
decrease swelling. one ways decrease swelling many parts
body cool. decreases inflammation. decreases blood flow. think
really interesting topic



00:41:25 Extraordinary (Tripling!) Performance Cooling Palms

something investigated. kind hard investigate. - Yeah,
interesting. Okay. hear stories. seen data. believe
stories. Maybe tell us story observation group made
respect anaerobic exercise proper cooling glabrous surfaces.
can talk technology. Maybe give us dips example first. - Okay. -
course, think people familiar dips. supposed to, guess- - Raise
lower body. - Yeah, raise lower body, raise lower body mass
usually legs dangling down. Sometimes people strong enough attach
weight do, essentially compound upper body exercise. - Right. -
One dip not particularly impressive people. 100
impressive. 20 impressive some, et cetera. happens skilled
athlete comes dips multiple sets. happens cool
properly using glabrous skin surface? - story occurred early
investigations first made discoveries cooling benefit increase
work volume, capacity reps, okay? word got over, think,
49ers camp. one players, Greg Clark, tight end time.
tight end Stanford. decided, don't know asked, what,
come check out. Greg came said, "Greg,
good at? activity like do?" said, "Dips. can lot dips. can
40 dips first set. can probably five sets. usual workout me."
said okay. came gym one day exactly did.
40 dips first set, maybe 25 15 down, down- - recall
roughly kind rest periods taking sets? - Yeah, standardized
rest period three minutes, set cooling
injure- - good long rest period. - Yeah. is. - still lot dips. - Yeah,
actually longer rest period many people prefer workouts. want
make time- - Not me. prefer take much rest possibly can,
yeah. - several days later came back first set, did, think, maybe 42,
little bit better, now people standing around watching. little
impetus show off. second set was, don't remember numbers,
much second set control day. cooled his- -
Okay, cooling? - sitting putting hands


devices built, cooling palms hands. - long
cooling take? Can inside three-minute rest period? - Yeah,
doing. standardized interval resting cooling three minutes,
okay. point got fifth set sets
done previous day. said, "I'm not tired. can another set."
can another set. can another set. can another set. one day two
three days later cooling, doubled total work volume. doubled total
number dips. - adding sets repetitions set? - Right,
kept coming back four weeks, twice week. end month,
300 dips. - Wow. percent- - tripled. - tripled. - Tripled,
professional athlete

00:45:35 Enhancing Recovery, Eliminating Soreness w/Intra-workout Cooling

peak physical conditioning, triples can do. - Amazing, terms
ability recover, explored discussed all? understanding
cause enough stress muscle anaerobic training, provide
stimulus compensatory regrowth, et cetera, work, essentially
scale amount recovery needed recovery time. curious
whether not needed longer recover super-performing
workouts? - interesting. major discovery, didn't realize
making time. phenomenon referring delayed
onset muscle soreness, DOMS. due little micro tares, forth,
happening extend workout capacity volume, okay?
experience many times athlete anyone will come lab will
exceed previous goals were, previous expectations. can always
see words coming mouth, "I'm going sore tomorrow." never
are. - Interesting. - actually demonstrated naive group.
class, physical conditioning class. half the, first days class,
establish true capacity, do. pretty heavy
workouts new recruits. gave half benefit cooling
half not. record subjective levels delayed onset
muscle soreness. cool, didn't significant muscle soreness. -
Amazing, know also published results, will provide links


papers people seeing similar effects, say, similar performance
enhancing effects, using bench presses, bench press, pushups, sorts
things. Maybe give us example realm endurance work
aerobic work, running, cycling, things sort. - Well, one problems with,
us, equipment now not really portable. mean, portable sense
can carry gym football field. - not going run run
it. - not going run it, right. - equip bicycle it. Although
cooling handles bicycles coming? - good, one itinerant
activity golfing. people put golf carts, and- - people really heat
much golf? - do. - Not disparaging golfers, way
conceptualize golf, like swing walk cart ride meal.
probably just offended golfers there. - Well, one time work
Department Defense. wanted check out, whether not
really worthwhile. sent team special ops soldiers
subjects test out. week. fun week. -
Yeah, work guys. hard driving guys. also know
fun. yeah, definitely have, off quit switch, buried
deep within nervous system. don't like hit quit switch. - guy
wrote final report, gave addendum report said, "Well, tell
this. gotten home, added technology," took technology
them. wanted keep it. - Oh, Yeah. sounds right. - using it,
added 20 yards every club bag. no effin' small deal. - Wow,
allowing people hit further, hit golf ball further? - Right. [chuckles] - Interesting.
right. golf players there, reward get back Craig
little knocks golf.

00:50:00 Multiple Sclerosis: Heat Sensitivity & Amelioration Cooling

don't knock golf. just don't think sport heating
limiting factor. since getting drive, think's going
there? - Well, can heating up. - wear gloves, right? -
wearing glove hot day, forth. let just tell one serious story
golfers individuals multiple sclerosis exceedingly temperature-
sensitive. - didn't know that. - may still mobile, stay cool


locations not increase exercise great extent. subjects
multiple sclerosis just essentially put device golf cart
back playing golf middle summer. - Oh, great. - Yeah. -
great. Anything allows people normal levels livelihood recreation
great. always think performance kinds like peak elite levels
pushing harder, yeah,

00:51:00 Enhancing Endurance Proper Cooling

anything allows people mobile functional great. favorite
example endurance, feel free give us extreme one talk
averages make sure thorough averages versus exceptions. - Right.
haven't done lot field. mean outdoors. endurance hot
room treadmill work, forth. first experiment had, think,
maybe 18 subjects just off street. Maybe just recruited people hallways,
come this. found could, group one trial
without cooling, double endurance, walking treadmill, walking
uphill treadmill heat, like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature, 40
degrees centigrade. - experiment look like? people walk
incline. really warm. people just going hit quit button say,
enough get off treadmill proper cooling.
cooling? - continuously. - see. - laboratory, can
suspend devices ceiling, example. Now prototype wearable
devices. response emails Ebola workers number years ago
Sierra Leone. said, "We've read work athletes. Can't
something us? mean, personal protective gear, can't
hot zone 15 20 minutes." started us challenge
developing wearable systems go PPE. published work
now, but-. - great, guessing military special operators
desert locations probably excited technology. - Well,
get it. - get. coming, coming. Yeah, think people might
wonder, studies

00:53:00 Cool Mitt, Ice-Cold Cold, 3 Minutes Cooling



incredible results years haven't heard
it? will ask opinion well. just editorialize little bit.
best laboratory work practical applications oftentimes requires many
studies. oftentimes isn't portal, speak, get information
technology sector. company developing technology
people use, purchase use. might well just tell us now, name
company? website? People going want know
can get magical technology? poor man's version well? -
Well, company Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A, website www.coolmitt.com.
CoolMitt just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com - great website. went there,
says right now, technology available professional sports teams
military. true? - Well, stand now new version technology
sort beta test versions. got hands people used
technology before. NFL teams using. college teams.
Olympics. Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball, NBA, National
Tennis Association. locations now trying reporting
back, working? change it? improve it?
forth. are. website, can actually sign one
will able get one [chuckles] finally manufactured. now
made fairly small lots, want change things realize
can improved. - Yeah. Stanford all. want get technology right.
like joke one reasons like Stanford much that, not
colleagues amazing forward thinking, perfectionists.
perfectionist mindset perfect can go live,
speak. Well, think will lot interest. talk technology little
detail moment. talk whether not cruder forms
technology exist either sake safety and/or performance. is, CoolMitt,
understand mitt, glove. put hand into, hold
surface. surface cools hand thereby specialized portal,
cools core body temperature muscles body. Subjectively,
right now, think ice cold think just cool? -
Just cool. - see. - Ice cold cold. people always ask, well, can't just
stick hand bucket ice water? cold. causes


reflex, vasoconstriction portals trying maximize heat loss
from. stick hand cold water, comes out, cold. - just
sealed heat body. - Yeah. Right, sort recommended
someone one point, said, "Well, running, can't just carry frozen juice
can, will gradually melt?" said, "Well, no, going decrease
heat loss hand. every couple minutes switched hands, [chuckles]
might work. - Well, feeling people now well
trying this. long, CoolMitt proper temperature, long people
putting hands Mitt? - We, again, just standardized three
minutes. part reason rate heat loss exponentially
declining curve, okay? three minutes sort gets best part curve.
can go longer get benefit, biggest bang buck first two,
three minutes. - Okay, mentioned number impressive organizations, sports
teams, military using this. not something typically see
sidelines games. Although honest, haven't looked carefully. guessing
probably keeping technology somewhat wraps. Where,
this? running back locker room? mean, military
special operators thing, terms athletes, possible,
hypothetically, athletes somewhat incognito? - possible, really
don't know. People mentioned Stanford, don't see football team
using it. Well, football team Stanford mostly playing cold weather, cool
weather. night games cool. Even day games not hot frequently here.
go hot place like Arizona Utah, least coach,

00:58:20 Can Use Palmer Cooling Enhance Performance

Shaw, says take find benefit.
use it. - Interesting, poor person's, poor man woman's version
this? mentioned juice can passing back forth. mentioned cooling
hands. number people said learning little bit science
technology experienced big effects, positive effects cooling by,
confess, done this, taking package frozen blueberries, just kind passing
back forth hands. Now talking you, realize probably didn't
long enough. probably was, maybe 30 seconds passing back


forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just

aching cold, palms hands sweating hot. - Oh,
amazing. Amazing. compartments real thing. mentioned
upper half face- - upper part, primate ancestors don't
fur. - bottoms feet. just take moment talk
amazing results associated proper cooling glabrous
skin surfaces. - Let introduce one thing. - Sure. - asked earlier
pouring water head, okay? One things not
appreciated fully blood perfusing special blood vessels
face beard line, non-hairy skin, blood returns venous
supply heart, actually strange way. actually goes
called, blocking name now. - Take time. - blood
vessels go skull, okay? scalp bleeds lot cut
scalp. blood vessels called, want say emergent, not
emergent. word means leaving. blood vessels primarily thought
ways blood leaving brain. overheated, direction flow
blood vessels reverses. cool blood coming facial region
goes circulation actually cooling source brain. can cool
brain. can cooling effect brain pouring water head. -
Interesting, practice, we, least me, commonly associate
combat sports, fighter goes corner. usually sit stool,
unless trying mental warfare corner, case,
don't even take seat. corner crew will squeeze glove, excuse me, sponge
full cold water them, saying somewhat effective cooling
brain? - Yeah, one natural mechanisms cooling brain. - want return
point well, known benefit cooling brain terms
offsetting physical damage, offsetting negative effects concussion.
one reasons fighters will often get, back, cold item back
neck head not just cool down, theory might offset
damage neurons. - just can't comment that. aware ideas,
controversial. One things want injury brain
decrease swelling. one ways decrease swelling many parts
body cool. decreases inflammation. decreases blood flow. think
really interesting topic



00:41:25 Extraordinary (Tripling!) Performance Cooling Palms

something investigated. kind hard investigate. - Yeah,
interesting. Okay. hear stories. seen data. believe
stories. Maybe tell us story observation group made
respect anaerobic exercise proper cooling glabrous surfaces.
can talk technology. Maybe give us dips example first. - Okay. -
course, think people familiar dips. supposed to, guess- - Raise
lower body. - Yeah, raise lower body, raise lower body mass
usually legs dangling down. Sometimes people strong enough attach
weight do, essentially compound upper body exercise. - Right. -
One dip not particularly impressive people. 100
impressive. 20 impressive some, et cetera. happens skilled
athlete comes dips multiple sets. happens cool
properly using glabrous skin surface? - story occurred early
investigations first made discoveries cooling benefit increase
work volume, capacity reps, okay? word got over, think,
49ers camp. one players, Greg Clark, tight end time.
tight end Stanford. decided, don't know asked, what,
come check out. Greg came said, "Greg,
good at? activity like do?" said, "Dips. can lot dips. can
40 dips first set. can probably five sets. usual workout me."
said okay. came gym one day exactly did.
40 dips first set, maybe 25 15 down, down- - recall
roughly kind rest periods taking sets? - Yeah, standardized
rest period three minutes, set cooling
injure- - good long rest period. - Yeah. is. - still lot dips. - Yeah,
actually longer rest period many people prefer workouts. want
make time- - Not me. prefer take much rest possibly can,
yeah. - several days later came back first set, did, think, maybe 42,
little bit better, now people standing around watching. little
impetus show off. second set was, don't remember numbers,
much second set control day. cooled his- -
Okay, cooling? - sitting putting hands


devices built, cooling palms hands. - long
cooling take? Can inside three-minute rest period? - Yeah,
doing. standardized interval resting cooling three minutes,
okay. point got fifth set sets
done previous day. said, "I'm not tired. can another set."
can another set. can another set. can another set. one day two
three days later cooling, doubled total work volume. doubled total
number dips. - adding sets repetitions set? - Right,
kept coming back four weeks, twice week. end month,
300 dips. - Wow. percent- - tripled. - tripled. - Tripled,
professional athlete

00:45:35 Enhancing Recovery, Eliminating Soreness w/Intra-workout Cooling

peak physical conditioning, triples can do. - Amazing, terms
ability recover, explored discussed all? understanding
cause enough stress muscle anaerobic training, provide
stimulus compensatory regrowth, et cetera, work, essentially
scale amount recovery needed recovery time. curious
whether not needed longer recover super-performing
workouts? - interesting. major discovery, didn't realize
making time. phenomenon referring delayed
onset muscle soreness, DOMS. due little micro tares, forth,
happening extend workout capacity volume, okay?
experience many times athlete anyone will come lab will
exceed previous goals were, previous expectations. can always
see words coming mouth, "I'm going sore tomorrow." never
are. - Interesting. - actually demonstrated naive group.
class, physical conditioning class. half the, first days class,
establish true capacity, do. pretty heavy
workouts new recruits. gave half benefit cooling
half not. record subjective levels delayed onset
muscle soreness. cool, didn't significant muscle soreness. -
Amazing, know also published results, will provide links


papers people seeing similar effects, say, similar performance
enhancing effects, using bench presses, bench press, pushups, sorts
things. Maybe give us example realm endurance work
aerobic work, running, cycling, things sort. - Well, one problems with,
us, equipment now not really portable. mean, portable sense
can carry gym football field. - not going run run
it. - not going run it, right. - equip bicycle it. Although
cooling handles bicycles coming? - good, one itinerant
activity golfing. people put golf carts, and- - people really heat
much golf? - do. - Not disparaging golfers, way
conceptualize golf, like swing walk cart ride meal.
probably just offended golfers there. - Well, one time work
Department Defense. wanted check out, whether not
really worthwhile. sent team special ops soldiers
subjects test out. week. fun week. -
Yeah, work guys. hard driving guys. also know
fun. yeah, definitely have, off quit switch, buried
deep within nervous system. don't like hit quit switch. - guy
wrote final report, gave addendum report said, "Well, tell
this. gotten home, added technology," took technology
them. wanted keep it. - Oh, Yeah. sounds right. - using it,
added 20 yards every club bag. no effin' small deal. - Wow,
allowing people hit further, hit golf ball further? - Right. [chuckles] - Interesting.
right. golf players there, reward get back Craig
little knocks golf.

00:50:00 Multiple Sclerosis: Heat Sensitivity & Amelioration Cooling

don't knock golf. just don't think sport heating
limiting factor. since getting drive, think's going
there? - Well, can heating up. - wear gloves, right? -
wearing glove hot day, forth. let just tell one serious story
golfers individuals multiple sclerosis exceedingly temperature-
sensitive. - didn't know that. - may still mobile, stay cool


locations not increase exercise great extent. subjects
multiple sclerosis just essentially put device golf cart
back playing golf middle summer. - Oh, great. - Yeah. -
great. Anything allows people normal levels livelihood recreation
great. always think performance kinds like peak elite levels
pushing harder, yeah,

00:51:00 Enhancing Endurance Proper Cooling

anything allows people mobile functional great. favorite
example endurance, feel free give us extreme one talk
averages make sure thorough averages versus exceptions. - Right.
haven't done lot field. mean outdoors. endurance hot
room treadmill work, forth. first experiment had, think,
maybe 18 subjects just off street. Maybe just recruited people hallways,
come this. found could, group one trial
without cooling, double endurance, walking treadmill, walking
uphill treadmill heat, like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature, 40
degrees centigrade. - experiment look like? people walk
incline. really warm. people just going hit quit button say,
enough get off treadmill proper cooling.
cooling? - continuously. - see. - laboratory, can
suspend devices ceiling, example. Now prototype wearable
devices. response emails Ebola workers number years ago
Sierra Leone. said, "We've read work athletes. Can't
something us? mean, personal protective gear, can't
hot zone 15 20 minutes." started us challenge
developing wearable systems go PPE. published work
now, but-. - great, guessing military special operators
desert locations probably excited technology. - Well,
get it. - get. coming, coming. Yeah, think people might
wonder, studies

00:53:00 Cool Mitt, Ice-Cold Cold, 3 Minutes Cooling



incredible results years haven't heard
it? will ask opinion well. just editorialize little bit.
best laboratory work practical applications oftentimes requires many
studies. oftentimes isn't portal, speak, get information
technology sector. company developing technology
people use, purchase use. might well just tell us now, name
company? website? People going want know
can get magical technology? poor man's version well? -
Well, company Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A, website www.coolmitt.com.
CoolMitt just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com - great website. went there,
says right now, technology available professional sports teams
military. true? - Well, stand now new version technology
sort beta test versions. got hands people used
technology before. NFL teams using. college teams.
Olympics. Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball, NBA, National
Tennis Association. locations now trying reporting
back, working? change it? improve it?
forth. are. website, can actually sign one
will able get one [chuckles] finally manufactured. now
made fairly small lots, want change things realize
can improved. - Yeah. Stanford all. want get technology right.
like joke one reasons like Stanford much that, not
colleagues amazing forward thinking, perfectionists.
perfectionist mindset perfect can go live,
speak. Well, think will lot interest. talk technology little
detail moment. talk whether not cruder forms
technology exist either sake safety and/or performance. is, CoolMitt,
understand mitt, glove. put hand into, hold
surface. surface cools hand thereby specialized portal,
cools core body temperature muscles body. Subjectively,
right now, think ice cold think just cool? -
Just cool. - see. - Ice cold cold. people always ask, well, can't just
stick hand bucket ice water? cold. causes


reflex, vasoconstriction portals trying maximize heat loss
from. stick hand cold water, comes out, cold. - just
sealed heat body. - Yeah. Right, sort recommended
someone one point, said, "Well, running, can't just carry frozen juice
can, will gradually melt?" said, "Well, no, going decrease
heat loss hand. every couple minutes switched hands, [chuckles]
might work. - Well, feeling people now well
trying this. long, CoolMitt proper temperature, long people
putting hands Mitt? - We, again, just standardized three
minutes. part reason rate heat loss exponentially
declining curve, okay? three minutes sort gets best part curve.
can go longer get benefit, biggest bang buck first two,
three minutes. - Okay, mentioned number impressive organizations, sports
teams, military using this. not something typically see
sidelines games. Although honest, haven't looked carefully. guessing
probably keeping technology somewhat wraps. Where,
this? running back locker room? mean, military
special operators thing, terms athletes, possible,
hypothetically, athletes somewhat incognito? - possible, really
don't know. People mentioned Stanford, don't see football team
using it. Well, football team Stanford mostly playing cold weather, cool
weather. night games cool. Even day games not hot frequently here.
go hot place like Arizona Utah, least coach,

00:58:20 Can Use Palmer Cooling Enhance Performance

Shaw, says take find benefit.
use it. - Interesting, poor person's, poor man woman's version
this? mentioned juice can passing back forth. mentioned cooling
hands. number people said learning little bit science
technology experienced big effects, positive effects cooling by,
confess, done this, taking package frozen blueberries, just kind passing
back forth hands. Now talking you, realize probably didn't
long enough. probably was, maybe 30 seconds passing back


forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

00:41:25 Extraordinary (Tripling!) Performance Cooling Palms

something investigated. kind hard investigate. - Yeah,
interesting. Okay. hear stories. seen data. believe
stories. Maybe tell us story observation group made
respect anaerobic exercise proper cooling glabrous surfaces.
can talk technology. Maybe give us dips example first. - Okay. -
course, think people familiar dips. supposed to, guess- - Raise
lower body. - Yeah, raise lower body, raise lower body mass
usually legs dangling down. Sometimes people strong enough attach
weight do, essentially compound upper body exercise. - Right. -
One dip not particularly impressive people. 100
impressive. 20 impressive some, et cetera. happens skilled
athlete comes dips multiple sets. happens cool
properly using glabrous skin surface? - story occurred early
investigations first made discoveries cooling benefit increase
work volume, capacity reps, okay? word got over, think,
49ers camp. one players, Greg Clark, tight end time.
tight end Stanford. decided, don't know asked, what,
come check out. Greg came said, "Greg,
good at? activity like do?" said, "Dips. can lot dips. can
40 dips first set. can probably five sets. usual workout me."
said okay. came gym one day exactly did.
40 dips first set, maybe 25 15 down, down- - recall
roughly kind rest periods taking sets? - Yeah, standardized
rest period three minutes, set cooling
injure- - good long rest period. - Yeah. is. - still lot dips. - Yeah,
actually longer rest period many people prefer workouts. want
make time- - Not me. prefer take much rest possibly can,
yeah. - several days later came back first set, did, think, maybe 42,
little bit better, now people standing around watching. little
impetus show off. second set was, don't remember numbers,
much second set control day. cooled his- -
Okay, cooling? - sitting putting hands


devices built, cooling palms hands. - long
cooling take? Can inside three-minute rest period? - Yeah,
doing. standardized interval resting cooling three minutes,
okay. point got fifth set sets
done previous day. said, "I'm not tired. can another set."
can another set. can another set. can another set. one day two
three days later cooling, doubled total work volume. doubled total
number dips. - adding sets repetitions set? - Right,
kept coming back four weeks, twice week. end month,
300 dips. - Wow. percent- - tripled. - tripled. - Tripled,
professional athlete

00:45:35 Enhancing Recovery, Eliminating Soreness w/Intra-workout Cooling

peak physical conditioning, triples can do. - Amazing, terms
ability recover, explored discussed all? understanding
cause enough stress muscle anaerobic training, provide
stimulus compensatory regrowth, et cetera, work, essentially
scale amount recovery needed recovery time. curious
whether not needed longer recover super-performing
workouts? - interesting. major discovery, didn't realize
making time. phenomenon referring delayed
onset muscle soreness, DOMS. due little micro tares, forth,
happening extend workout capacity volume, okay?
experience many times athlete anyone will come lab will
exceed previous goals were, previous expectations. can always
see words coming mouth, "I'm going sore tomorrow." never
are. - Interesting. - actually demonstrated naive group.
class, physical conditioning class. half the, first days class,
establish true capacity, do. pretty heavy
workouts new recruits. gave half benefit cooling
half not. record subjective levels delayed onset
muscle soreness. cool, didn't significant muscle soreness. -
Amazing, know also published results, will provide links


papers people seeing similar effects, say, similar performance
enhancing effects, using bench presses, bench press, pushups, sorts
things. Maybe give us example realm endurance work
aerobic work, running, cycling, things sort. - Well, one problems with,
us, equipment now not really portable. mean, portable sense
can carry gym football field. - not going run run
it. - not going run it, right. - equip bicycle it. Although
cooling handles bicycles coming? - good, one itinerant
activity golfing. people put golf carts, and- - people really heat
much golf? - do. - Not disparaging golfers, way
conceptualize golf, like swing walk cart ride meal.
probably just offended golfers there. - Well, one time work
Department Defense. wanted check out, whether not
really worthwhile. sent team special ops soldiers
subjects test out. week. fun week. -
Yeah, work guys. hard driving guys. also know
fun. yeah, definitely have, off quit switch, buried
deep within nervous system. don't like hit quit switch. - guy
wrote final report, gave addendum report said, "Well, tell
this. gotten home, added technology," took technology
them. wanted keep it. - Oh, Yeah. sounds right. - using it,
added 20 yards every club bag. no effin' small deal. - Wow,
allowing people hit further, hit golf ball further? - Right. [chuckles] - Interesting.
right. golf players there, reward get back Craig
little knocks golf.

00:50:00 Multiple Sclerosis: Heat Sensitivity & Amelioration Cooling

don't knock golf. just don't think sport heating
limiting factor. since getting drive, think's going
there? - Well, can heating up. - wear gloves, right? -
wearing glove hot day, forth. let just tell one serious story
golfers individuals multiple sclerosis exceedingly temperature-
sensitive. - didn't know that. - may still mobile, stay cool


locations not increase exercise great extent. subjects
multiple sclerosis just essentially put device golf cart
back playing golf middle summer. - Oh, great. - Yeah. -
great. Anything allows people normal levels livelihood recreation
great. always think performance kinds like peak elite levels
pushing harder, yeah,

00:51:00 Enhancing Endurance Proper Cooling

anything allows people mobile functional great. favorite
example endurance, feel free give us extreme one talk
averages make sure thorough averages versus exceptions. - Right.
haven't done lot field. mean outdoors. endurance hot
room treadmill work, forth. first experiment had, think,
maybe 18 subjects just off street. Maybe just recruited people hallways,
come this. found could, group one trial
without cooling, double endurance, walking treadmill, walking
uphill treadmill heat, like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature, 40
degrees centigrade. - experiment look like? people walk
incline. really warm. people just going hit quit button say,
enough get off treadmill proper cooling.
cooling? - continuously. - see. - laboratory, can
suspend devices ceiling, example. Now prototype wearable
devices. response emails Ebola workers number years ago
Sierra Leone. said, "We've read work athletes. Can't
something us? mean, personal protective gear, can't
hot zone 15 20 minutes." started us challenge
developing wearable systems go PPE. published work
now, but-. - great, guessing military special operators
desert locations probably excited technology. - Well,
get it. - get. coming, coming. Yeah, think people might
wonder, studies

00:53:00 Cool Mitt, Ice-Cold Cold, 3 Minutes Cooling



incredible results years haven't heard
it? will ask opinion well. just editorialize little bit.
best laboratory work practical applications oftentimes requires many
studies. oftentimes isn't portal, speak, get information
technology sector. company developing technology
people use, purchase use. might well just tell us now, name
company? website? People going want know
can get magical technology? poor man's version well? -
Well, company Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A, website www.coolmitt.com.
CoolMitt just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com - great website. went there,
says right now, technology available professional sports teams
military. true? - Well, stand now new version technology
sort beta test versions. got hands people used
technology before. NFL teams using. college teams.
Olympics. Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball, NBA, National
Tennis Association. locations now trying reporting
back, working? change it? improve it?
forth. are. website, can actually sign one
will able get one [chuckles] finally manufactured. now
made fairly small lots, want change things realize
can improved. - Yeah. Stanford all. want get technology right.
like joke one reasons like Stanford much that, not
colleagues amazing forward thinking, perfectionists.
perfectionist mindset perfect can go live,
speak. Well, think will lot interest. talk technology little
detail moment. talk whether not cruder forms
technology exist either sake safety and/or performance. is, CoolMitt,
understand mitt, glove. put hand into, hold
surface. surface cools hand thereby specialized portal,
cools core body temperature muscles body. Subjectively,
right now, think ice cold think just cool? -
Just cool. - see. - Ice cold cold. people always ask, well, can't just
stick hand bucket ice water? cold. causes


reflex, vasoconstriction portals trying maximize heat loss
from. stick hand cold water, comes out, cold. - just
sealed heat body. - Yeah. Right, sort recommended
someone one point, said, "Well, running, can't just carry frozen juice
can, will gradually melt?" said, "Well, no, going decrease
heat loss hand. every couple minutes switched hands, [chuckles]
might work. - Well, feeling people now well
trying this. long, CoolMitt proper temperature, long people
putting hands Mitt? - We, again, just standardized three
minutes. part reason rate heat loss exponentially
declining curve, okay? three minutes sort gets best part curve.
can go longer get benefit, biggest bang buck first two,
three minutes. - Okay, mentioned number impressive organizations, sports
teams, military using this. not something typically see
sidelines games. Although honest, haven't looked carefully. guessing
probably keeping technology somewhat wraps. Where,
this? running back locker room? mean, military
special operators thing, terms athletes, possible,
hypothetically, athletes somewhat incognito? - possible, really
don't know. People mentioned Stanford, don't see football team
using it. Well, football team Stanford mostly playing cold weather, cool
weather. night games cool. Even day games not hot frequently here.
go hot place like Arizona Utah, least coach,

00:58:20 Can Use Palmer Cooling Enhance Performance

Shaw, says take find benefit.
use it. - Interesting, poor person's, poor man woman's version
this? mentioned juice can passing back forth. mentioned cooling
hands. number people said learning little bit science
technology experienced big effects, positive effects cooling by,
confess, done this, taking package frozen blueberries, just kind passing
back forth hands. Now talking you, realize probably didn't
long enough. probably was, maybe 30 seconds passing back


forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

devices built, cooling palms hands. - long
cooling take? Can inside three-minute rest period? - Yeah,
doing. standardized interval resting cooling three minutes,
okay. point got fifth set sets
done previous day. said, "I'm not tired. can another set."
can another set. can another set. can another set. one day two
three days later cooling, doubled total work volume. doubled total

00:45:35 Enhancing Recovery, Eliminating Soreness w/Intra-workout Cooling

peak physical conditioning, triples can do. - Amazing, terms
ability recover, explored discussed all? understanding
cause enough stress muscle anaerobic training, provide
stimulus compensatory regrowth, et cetera, work, essentially
scale amount recovery needed recovery time. curious
whether not needed longer recover super-performing
workouts? - interesting. major discovery, didn't realize
making time. phenomenon referring delayed
onset muscle soreness, DOMS. due little micro tares, forth,
happening extend workout capacity volume, okay?
experience many times athlete anyone will come lab will
exceed previous goals were, previous expectations. can always
see words coming mouth, "I'm going sore tomorrow." never
are. - Interesting. - actually demonstrated naive group.
class, physical conditioning class. half the, first days class,
establish true capacity, do. pretty heavy
workouts new recruits. gave half benefit cooling
half not. record subjective levels delayed onset
muscle soreness. cool, didn't significant muscle soreness. -
Amazing, know also published results, will provide links


papers people seeing similar effects, say, similar performance
enhancing effects, using bench presses, bench press, pushups, sorts
things. Maybe give us example realm endurance work
aerobic work, running, cycling, things sort. - Well, one problems with,
us, equipment now not really portable. mean, portable sense
can carry gym football field. - not going run run
it. - not going run it, right. - equip bicycle it. Although
cooling handles bicycles coming? - good, one itinerant
activity golfing. people put golf carts, and- - people really heat
much golf? - do. - Not disparaging golfers, way
conceptualize golf, like swing walk cart ride meal.
probably just offended golfers there. - Well, one time work
Department Defense. wanted check out, whether not
really worthwhile. sent team special ops soldiers
subjects test out. week. fun week. -
Yeah, work guys. hard driving guys. also know
fun. yeah, definitely have, off quit switch, buried
deep within nervous system. don't like hit quit switch. - guy
wrote final report, gave addendum report said, "Well, tell
this. gotten home, added technology," took technology
them. wanted keep it. - Oh, Yeah. sounds right. - using it,
added 20 yards every club bag. no effin' small deal. - Wow,
allowing people hit further, hit golf ball further? - Right. [chuckles] - Interesting.
right. golf players there, reward get back Craig
little knocks golf.

00:50:00 Multiple Sclerosis: Heat Sensitivity & Amelioration Cooling

don't knock golf. just don't think sport heating
limiting factor. since getting drive, think's going
there? - Well, can heating up. - wear gloves, right? -
wearing glove hot day, forth. let just tell one serious story
golfers individuals multiple sclerosis exceedingly temperature-
sensitive. - didn't know that. - may still mobile, stay cool


locations not increase exercise great extent. subjects
multiple sclerosis just essentially put device golf cart
back playing golf middle summer. - Oh, great. - Yeah. -
great. Anything allows people normal levels livelihood recreation
great. always think performance kinds like peak elite levels
pushing harder, yeah,

00:51:00 Enhancing Endurance Proper Cooling

anything allows people mobile functional great. favorite
example endurance, feel free give us extreme one talk
averages make sure thorough averages versus exceptions. - Right.
haven't done lot field. mean outdoors. endurance hot
room treadmill work, forth. first experiment had, think,
maybe 18 subjects just off street. Maybe just recruited people hallways,
come this. found could, group one trial
without cooling, double endurance, walking treadmill, walking
uphill treadmill heat, like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature, 40
degrees centigrade. - experiment look like? people walk
incline. really warm. people just going hit quit button say,
enough get off treadmill proper cooling.
cooling? - continuously. - see. - laboratory, can
suspend devices ceiling, example. Now prototype wearable
devices. response emails Ebola workers number years ago
Sierra Leone. said, "We've read work athletes. Can't
something us? mean, personal protective gear, can't
hot zone 15 20 minutes." started us challenge
developing wearable systems go PPE. published work
now, but-. - great, guessing military special operators
desert locations probably excited technology. - Well,
get it. - get. coming, coming. Yeah, think people might
wonder, studies

00:53:00 Cool Mitt, Ice-Cold Cold, 3 Minutes Cooling



incredible results years haven't heard
it? will ask opinion well. just editorialize little bit.
best laboratory work practical applications oftentimes requires many
studies. oftentimes isn't portal, speak, get information
technology sector. company developing technology
people use, purchase use. might well just tell us now, name
company? website? People going want know
can get magical technology? poor man's version well? -
Well, company Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A, website www.coolmitt.com.
CoolMitt just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com - great website. went there,
says right now, technology available professional sports teams
military. true? - Well, stand now new version technology
sort beta test versions. got hands people used
technology before. NFL teams using. college teams.
Olympics. Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball, NBA, National
Tennis Association. locations now trying reporting
back, working? change it? improve it?
forth. are. website, can actually sign one
will able get one [chuckles] finally manufactured. now
made fairly small lots, want change things realize
can improved. - Yeah. Stanford all. want get technology right.
like joke one reasons like Stanford much that, not
colleagues amazing forward thinking, perfectionists.
perfectionist mindset perfect can go live,
speak. Well, think will lot interest. talk technology little
detail moment. talk whether not cruder forms
technology exist either sake safety and/or performance. is, CoolMitt,
understand mitt, glove. put hand into, hold
surface. surface cools hand thereby specialized portal,
cools core body temperature muscles body. Subjectively,
right now, think ice cold think just cool? -
Just cool. - see. - Ice cold cold. people always ask, well, can't just
stick hand bucket ice water? cold. causes


reflex, vasoconstriction portals trying maximize heat loss
from. stick hand cold water, comes out, cold. - just
sealed heat body. - Yeah. Right, sort recommended
someone one point, said, "Well, running, can't just carry frozen juice
can, will gradually melt?" said, "Well, no, going decrease
heat loss hand. every couple minutes switched hands, [chuckles]
might work. - Well, feeling people now well
trying this. long, CoolMitt proper temperature, long people
putting hands Mitt? - We, again, just standardized three
minutes. part reason rate heat loss exponentially
declining curve, okay? three minutes sort gets best part curve.
can go longer get benefit, biggest bang buck first two,
three minutes. - Okay, mentioned number impressive organizations, sports
teams, military using this. not something typically see
sidelines games. Although honest, haven't looked carefully. guessing
probably keeping technology somewhat wraps. Where,
this? running back locker room? mean, military
special operators thing, terms athletes, possible,
hypothetically, athletes somewhat incognito? - possible, really
don't know. People mentioned Stanford, don't see football team
using it. Well, football team Stanford mostly playing cold weather, cool
weather. night games cool. Even day games not hot frequently here.
go hot place like Arizona Utah, least coach,

00:58:20 Can Use Palmer Cooling Enhance Performance

Shaw, says take find benefit.
use it. - Interesting, poor person's, poor man woman's version
this? mentioned juice can passing back forth. mentioned cooling
hands. number people said learning little bit science
technology experienced big effects, positive effects cooling by,
confess, done this, taking package frozen blueberries, just kind passing
back forth hands. Now talking you, realize probably didn't
long enough. probably was, maybe 30 seconds passing back


forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

papers people seeing similar effects, say, similar performance
enhancing effects, using bench presses, bench press, pushups, sorts
things. Maybe give us example realm endurance work
aerobic work, running, cycling, things sort. - Well, one problems with,
us, equipment now not really portable. mean, portable sense
can carry gym football field. - not going run run
it. - not going run it, right. - equip bicycle it. Although
cooling handles bicycles coming? - good, one itinerant
activity golfing. people put golf carts, and- - people really heat
much golf? - do. - Not disparaging golfers, way
conceptualize golf, like swing walk cart ride meal.
probably just offended golfers there. - Well, one time work
Department Defense. wanted check out, whether not
really worthwhile. sent team special ops soldiers
subjects test out. week. fun week. -
Yeah, work guys. hard driving guys. also know
fun. yeah, definitely have, off quit switch, buried
deep within nervous system. don't like hit quit switch. - guy
wrote final report, gave addendum report said, "Well, tell
this. gotten home, added technology," took technology
them. wanted keep it. - Oh, Yeah. sounds right. - using it,
added 20 yards every club bag. no effin' small deal. - Wow,
allowing people hit further, hit golf ball further? - Right. [chuckles] - Interesting.
right. golf players there, reward get back Craig
little knocks golf.

00:50:00 Multiple Sclerosis: Heat Sensitivity & Amelioration Cooling

don't knock golf. just don't think sport heating
limiting factor. since getting drive, think's going
there? - Well, can heating up. - wear gloves, right? -
wearing glove hot day, forth. let just tell one serious story
golfers individuals multiple sclerosis exceedingly temperature-
sensitive. - didn't know that. - may still mobile, stay cool


locations not increase exercise great extent. subjects
multiple sclerosis just essentially put device golf cart
back playing golf middle summer. - Oh, great. - Yeah. -
great. Anything allows people normal levels livelihood recreation
great. always think performance kinds like peak elite levels
pushing harder, yeah,

00:51:00 Enhancing Endurance Proper Cooling

anything allows people mobile functional great. favorite
example endurance, feel free give us extreme one talk
averages make sure thorough averages versus exceptions. - Right.
haven't done lot field. mean outdoors. endurance hot
room treadmill work, forth. first experiment had, think,
maybe 18 subjects just off street. Maybe just recruited people hallways,
come this. found could, group one trial
without cooling, double endurance, walking treadmill, walking
uphill treadmill heat, like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature, 40
degrees centigrade. - experiment look like? people walk
incline. really warm. people just going hit quit button say,
enough get off treadmill proper cooling.
cooling? - continuously. - see. - laboratory, can
suspend devices ceiling, example. Now prototype wearable
devices. response emails Ebola workers number years ago
Sierra Leone. said, "We've read work athletes. Can't
something us? mean, personal protective gear, can't
hot zone 15 20 minutes." started us challenge
developing wearable systems go PPE. published work
now, but-. - great, guessing military special operators
desert locations probably excited technology. - Well,
get it. - get. coming, coming. Yeah, think people might
wonder, studies

00:53:00 Cool Mitt, Ice-Cold Cold, 3 Minutes Cooling



incredible results years haven't heard
it? will ask opinion well. just editorialize little bit.
best laboratory work practical applications oftentimes requires many
studies. oftentimes isn't portal, speak, get information
technology sector. company developing technology
people use, purchase use. might well just tell us now, name
company? website? People going want know
can get magical technology? poor man's version well? -
Well, company Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A, website www.coolmitt.com.
CoolMitt just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com - great website. went there,
says right now, technology available professional sports teams
military. true? - Well, stand now new version technology
sort beta test versions. got hands people used
technology before. NFL teams using. college teams.
Olympics. Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball, NBA, National
Tennis Association. locations now trying reporting
back, working? change it? improve it?
forth. are. website, can actually sign one
will able get one [chuckles] finally manufactured. now
made fairly small lots, want change things realize
can improved. - Yeah. Stanford all. want get technology right.
like joke one reasons like Stanford much that, not
colleagues amazing forward thinking, perfectionists.
perfectionist mindset perfect can go live,
speak. Well, think will lot interest. talk technology little
detail moment. talk whether not cruder forms
technology exist either sake safety and/or performance. is, CoolMitt,
understand mitt, glove. put hand into, hold
surface. surface cools hand thereby specialized portal,
cools core body temperature muscles body. Subjectively,
right now, think ice cold think just cool? -
Just cool. - see. - Ice cold cold. people always ask, well, can't just
stick hand bucket ice water? cold. causes


reflex, vasoconstriction portals trying maximize heat loss
from. stick hand cold water, comes out, cold. - just
sealed heat body. - Yeah. Right, sort recommended
someone one point, said, "Well, running, can't just carry frozen juice
can, will gradually melt?" said, "Well, no, going decrease
heat loss hand. every couple minutes switched hands, [chuckles]
might work. - Well, feeling people now well
trying this. long, CoolMitt proper temperature, long people
putting hands Mitt? - We, again, just standardized three
minutes. part reason rate heat loss exponentially
declining curve, okay? three minutes sort gets best part curve.
can go longer get benefit, biggest bang buck first two,
three minutes. - Okay, mentioned number impressive organizations, sports
teams, military using this. not something typically see
sidelines games. Although honest, haven't looked carefully. guessing
probably keeping technology somewhat wraps. Where,
this? running back locker room? mean, military
special operators thing, terms athletes, possible,
hypothetically, athletes somewhat incognito? - possible, really
don't know. People mentioned Stanford, don't see football team
using it. Well, football team Stanford mostly playing cold weather, cool
weather. night games cool. Even day games not hot frequently here.
go hot place like Arizona Utah, least coach,

00:58:20 Can Use Palmer Cooling Enhance Performance

Shaw, says take find benefit.
use it. - Interesting, poor person's, poor man woman's version
this? mentioned juice can passing back forth. mentioned cooling
hands. number people said learning little bit science
technology experienced big effects, positive effects cooling by,
confess, done this, taking package frozen blueberries, just kind passing
back forth hands. Now talking you, realize probably didn't
long enough. probably was, maybe 30 seconds passing back


forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

locations not increase exercise great extent. subjects
multiple sclerosis just essentially put device golf cart
back playing golf middle summer. - Oh, great. - Yeah. -
great. Anything allows people normal levels livelihood recreation
great. always think performance kinds like peak elite levels
pushing harder, yeah,

00:51:00 Enhancing Endurance Proper Cooling

anything allows people mobile functional great. favorite
example endurance, feel free give us extreme one talk
averages make sure thorough averages versus exceptions. - Right.
haven't done lot field. mean outdoors. endurance hot
room treadmill work, forth. first experiment had, think,
maybe 18 subjects just off street. Maybe just recruited people hallways,
come this. found could, group one trial
without cooling, double endurance, walking treadmill, walking
uphill treadmill heat, like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature, 40
degrees centigrade. - experiment look like? people walk
incline. really warm. people just going hit quit button say,
enough get off treadmill proper cooling.
cooling? - continuously. - see. - laboratory, can
suspend devices ceiling, example. Now prototype wearable
devices. response emails Ebola workers number years ago
Sierra Leone. said, "We've read work athletes. Can't
something us? mean, personal protective gear, can't
hot zone 15 20 minutes." started us challenge
developing wearable systems go PPE. published work
now, but-. - great, guessing military special operators
desert locations probably excited technology. - Well,
get it. - get. coming, coming. Yeah, think people might
wonder, studies

00:53:00 Cool Mitt, Ice-Cold Cold, 3 Minutes Cooling



incredible results years haven't heard
it? will ask opinion well. just editorialize little bit.
best laboratory work practical applications oftentimes requires many
studies. oftentimes isn't portal, speak, get information
technology sector. company developing technology
people use, purchase use. might well just tell us now, name
company? website? People going want know
can get magical technology? poor man's version well? -
Well, company Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A, website www.coolmitt.com.
CoolMitt just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com - great website. went there,
says right now, technology available professional sports teams
military. true? - Well, stand now new version technology
sort beta test versions. got hands people used
technology before. NFL teams using. college teams.
Olympics. Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball, NBA, National
Tennis Association. locations now trying reporting
back, working? change it? improve it?
forth. are. website, can actually sign one
will able get one [chuckles] finally manufactured. now
made fairly small lots, want change things realize
can improved. - Yeah. Stanford all. want get technology right.
like joke one reasons like Stanford much that, not
colleagues amazing forward thinking, perfectionists.
perfectionist mindset perfect can go live,
speak. Well, think will lot interest. talk technology little
detail moment. talk whether not cruder forms
technology exist either sake safety and/or performance. is, CoolMitt,
understand mitt, glove. put hand into, hold
surface. surface cools hand thereby specialized portal,
cools core body temperature muscles body. Subjectively,
right now, think ice cold think just cool? -
Just cool. - see. - Ice cold cold. people always ask, well, can't just
stick hand bucket ice water? cold. causes


reflex, vasoconstriction portals trying maximize heat loss
from. stick hand cold water, comes out, cold. - just
sealed heat body. - Yeah. Right, sort recommended
someone one point, said, "Well, running, can't just carry frozen juice
can, will gradually melt?" said, "Well, no, going decrease
heat loss hand. every couple minutes switched hands, [chuckles]
might work. - Well, feeling people now well
trying this. long, CoolMitt proper temperature, long people
putting hands Mitt? - We, again, just standardized three
minutes. part reason rate heat loss exponentially
declining curve, okay? three minutes sort gets best part curve.
can go longer get benefit, biggest bang buck first two,
three minutes. - Okay, mentioned number impressive organizations, sports
teams, military using this. not something typically see
sidelines games. Although honest, haven't looked carefully. guessing
probably keeping technology somewhat wraps. Where,
this? running back locker room? mean, military
special operators thing, terms athletes, possible,
hypothetically, athletes somewhat incognito? - possible, really
don't know. People mentioned Stanford, don't see football team
using it. Well, football team Stanford mostly playing cold weather, cool
weather. night games cool. Even day games not hot frequently here.
go hot place like Arizona Utah, least coach,

00:58:20 Can Use Palmer Cooling Enhance Performance

Shaw, says take find benefit.
use it. - Interesting, poor person's, poor man woman's version
this? mentioned juice can passing back forth. mentioned cooling
hands. number people said learning little bit science
technology experienced big effects, positive effects cooling by,
confess, done this, taking package frozen blueberries, just kind passing
back forth hands. Now talking you, realize probably didn't
long enough. probably was, maybe 30 seconds passing back


forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

incredible results years haven't heard
it? will ask opinion well. just editorialize little bit.
best laboratory work practical applications oftentimes requires many
studies. oftentimes isn't portal, speak, get information
technology sector. company developing technology
people use, purchase use. might well just tell us now, name
company? website? People going want know
can get magical technology? poor man's version well? -
Well, company Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A, website www.coolmitt.com.
CoolMitt just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com - great website. went there,
says right now, technology available professional sports teams
military. true? - Well, stand now new version technology
sort beta test versions. got hands people used
technology before. NFL teams using. college teams.
Olympics. Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball, NBA, National
Tennis Association. locations now trying reporting
back, working? change it? improve it?
forth. are. website, can actually sign one
will able get one [chuckles] finally manufactured. now
made fairly small lots, want change things realize
can improved. - Yeah. Stanford all. want get technology right.
like joke one reasons like Stanford much that, not
colleagues amazing forward thinking, perfectionists.
perfectionist mindset perfect can go live,
speak. Well, think will lot interest. talk technology little
detail moment. talk whether not cruder forms
technology exist either sake safety and/or performance. is, CoolMitt,
understand mitt, glove. put hand into, hold
surface. surface cools hand thereby specialized portal,
cools core body temperature muscles body. Subjectively,
right now, think ice cold think just cool? -
Just cool. - see. - Ice cold cold. people always ask, well, can't just
stick hand bucket ice water? cold. causes


reflex, vasoconstriction portals trying maximize heat loss
from. stick hand cold water, comes out, cold. - just
sealed heat body. - Yeah. Right, sort recommended
someone one point, said, "Well, running, can't just carry frozen juice
can, will gradually melt?" said, "Well, no, going decrease
heat loss hand. every couple minutes switched hands, [chuckles]
might work. - Well, feeling people now well
trying this. long, CoolMitt proper temperature, long people
putting hands Mitt? - We, again, just standardized three
minutes. part reason rate heat loss exponentially
declining curve, okay? three minutes sort gets best part curve.
can go longer get benefit, biggest bang buck first two,
three minutes. - Okay, mentioned number impressive organizations, sports
teams, military using this. not something typically see
sidelines games. Although honest, haven't looked carefully. guessing
probably keeping technology somewhat wraps. Where,
this? running back locker room? mean, military
special operators thing, terms athletes, possible,
hypothetically, athletes somewhat incognito? - possible, really
don't know. People mentioned Stanford, don't see football team
using it. Well, football team Stanford mostly playing cold weather, cool
weather. night games cool. Even day games not hot frequently here.
go hot place like Arizona Utah, least coach,

00:58:20 Can Use Palmer Cooling Enhance Performance

Shaw, says take find benefit.
use it. - Interesting, poor person's, poor man woman's version
this? mentioned juice can passing back forth. mentioned cooling
hands. number people said learning little bit science
technology experienced big effects, positive effects cooling by,
confess, done this, taking package frozen blueberries, just kind passing
back forth hands. Now talking you, realize probably didn't
long enough. probably was, maybe 30 seconds passing back


forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

reflex, vasoconstriction portals trying maximize heat loss
from. stick hand cold water, comes out, cold. - just
sealed heat body. - Yeah. Right, sort recommended
someone one point, said, "Well, running, can't just carry frozen juice
can, will gradually melt?" said, "Well, no, going decrease
heat loss hand. every couple minutes switched hands, [chuckles]
might work. - Well, feeling people now well
trying this. long, CoolMitt proper temperature, long people
putting hands Mitt? - We, again, just standardized three
minutes. part reason rate heat loss exponentially
declining curve, okay? three minutes sort gets best part curve.
can go longer get benefit, biggest bang buck first two,
three minutes. - Okay, mentioned number impressive organizations, sports
teams, military using this. not something typically see
sidelines games. Although honest, haven't looked carefully. guessing
probably keeping technology somewhat wraps. Where,
this? running back locker room? mean, military
special operators thing, terms athletes, possible,
hypothetically, athletes somewhat incognito? - possible, really
don't know. People mentioned Stanford, don't see football team
using it. Well, football team Stanford mostly playing cold weather, cool
weather. night games cool. Even day games not hot frequently here.
go hot place like Arizona Utah, least coach,

00:58:20 Can Use Palmer Cooling Enhance Performance

Shaw, says take find benefit.
use it. - Interesting, poor person's, poor man woman's version
this? mentioned juice can passing back forth. mentioned cooling
hands. number people said learning little bit science
technology experienced big effects, positive effects cooling by,
confess, done this, taking package frozen blueberries, just kind passing
back forth hands. Now talking you, realize probably didn't
long enough. probably was, maybe 30 seconds passing back


forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

forth hands going back sets. see performance
enhancing effect. Absolutely. realized probably wasn't optimizing protocol.
going give crude protocol it, just say gym,
running, little bit tricky, look like people wanted just play
sort fashion? - Well, experimental. - Sure. Yeah, none
controlled. - idea frozen peas good idea. think since
no actual study that, working best
you. one way figure if, hold cold peas one hand
switch hand, someone comes in, feels hand, warm
cold? cold, means vasoconstricted. warm, means hot blood still
going there. Okay. lab. - key not vasoconstrict? -
Right. - Okay. test there, folks. going try kind
crude fashion, least CoolMitt available broadly general public,
want assess whether not palms actually feel cool touch
somebody else. does, means essentially shut portal.
sealing heat, bad. putting cold pack sort
face or- - feet? - feet? work home. don't often work
barefooted, suppose could, like 70s. guys
walking around without shoes squatting without shoes socks on. put
feet them? - could. simply water-profused pad
circulating cool water it, just put feet it, okay?

01:01:15 Radiation, Convection, Heat-Transfer, Role Surface Area

Part problem don't want, if, say just cold pack
something. problem back boundary layers again. don't convective
stream cooling medium, heat sink not effective, there'll
boundary layer developed heat sink material skin.
decreases efficacy. - see, maybe just moment, talk
convection, radiation, convection, just make clear. Like put hands,
say cold night campfire take hands put
fire- - getting radiation. - getting radiation. - Right. - Okay. - Right. -
windy warm night, no, don't know best example. Give us
good example convection. - Convection, sure, cool breeze. wind chill


factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

factor. due convection, okay? terms heat transfer two
objects, convection medium, whether blood inside water
outside, increase heat exchange conviction sides. -
Right, just planting feet two packages froze, bare feet two
packages frozen peas, really no opportunity circulation of, therefore
heat transfer. not really optimal, which, I- - again, depends
surface area get benefit all. study published,
investigating standard treatment hyperthermia field. standard
treatment, recommended medical organizations, take cold packs
put axilla, groin. - axilla armpit. - armpits, groin,
is- - Thin-skinned, lots vasculature. - Right, neck.
studies made people hyperthermic. measured rate
cool call putting positions heat exchange bags,
recommended location versus glabrous skin versus palms, soles, face.
cooling rate double. - Wow. - put ice packs, cold packs
heat portals, rather axilla, groin face. - Wow. - neck. -
Wow, face, hands bottoms feet will cool twice fast putting cold packs
armpits, groin, back neck? - like give analogy car
overheating, okay? hose, garden hose, spray
cooling system? spray radiator spray tubes going
radiator? Well, rationale putting cold packs axilla,
groin, neck, getting close major arteries, okay? Sure.
going effective. much effective actually increase heat
loss capacity radiating surface, radiators.

01:04:40 Hypothermia Story, Ideal Re-Heating Strategy

- cool hot stuff heading toward core? - essentially
standard operating procedure is. hit arteries. - Amazing. - veins.
Arteries veins. - going just tell brief story illustrates almost
everybody gets stuff wrong. going use opportunity ask
heating, deliberate heating, opposed deliberate cooling. four
months ago, friend mine, incidentally, guy nine years SEAL Teams,
really skilled cold water swimmer. went swim morning. not nearly


even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology

even close universe output potential. swims.
familiar them. got enough blubber stay warm enough cold
Pacific, no wetsuits. morning cold swim mile so.
brought us young kid know real well hangs us sometimes
trains us got little body fat. just exceptionally lean, despite
eating everything sight, right? Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
swimming point talking clear
gone hypothermic. slurring words. not well. get onto
beach. teeth turning yellow. quaking. saliva taken consistency
clear, like hypothermic. go lifeguard station. Lifeguard says, "Okay,
get vitals. this." Meanwhile, trying stand next him, heat
heating torso. are, pressing guy, friend, trying
heat up. get blanket him. realizing barefoot. face
exposed. Although cover head blanket. eventually came
back. got warm liquids okay. fine. don't know
whether mother's ever going let swim us again. ever disappear go
missing, incident. Anyway, great. recovered. back
water well. realized pretty much everything point
got back beach back normal, incorrectly. heated
torso. left extremities exposed. assumed right thing.
lifeguard skilled lifeguard major public beach. guess simple
question is, get everything wrong? get anything right?
better option heat hypothermic person that, similar situation?
- Well, interesting asked that, way got area
investigation. worked hypothalamus regulates body temperature,
neurophysiology. one day discussion colleague
department anesthesia. jokingly said colleague, said, "Yeah,
guys think know much temperature. bet couldn't solve problem
recovery room." that? Well, patient's come surgery.
hypothermic takes us hours get stop shivering.
recovery room? Exactly suggested. put warm blankets, put
heat lamps, takes hour two hours get patients stop
shivering, bring back up. said, "Ah, trivial problem." No. hard
problem. hard problem, anesthesia, vasodilated.


come anesthesia, hypothermic vasoconstrict,
makes difficult get heat body. got idea that, well,
just take one appendage, like arm, put environment wrapped
heating pad negative pressure, suction, pull blood limb,
blood get heated warm body faster. colleague built
prototype device. couldn't get device hospital days. [Craig
laughs] anesthesiologist friend, took recovery room.
first thing patient said, "No way, not going put patient."
prevailed first patient didn't shiver all, First patient back normal
temperature, core temperature in, think, eight minutes. - Amazing. - Eight nine
minutes. - now standard practice hospitals? - No. No, no. - another
example where, don't get upset the, although upsetting know not,
think yet another case fundamental problem exists.
science-based solution makes sense level physiology, engineering
practice, yet not done. - [Craig] Right. - And, mean, whole
discussion limitations are. Well, perhaps in, know number
listeners healthcare medical profession, well military, athletes,
just also standard types jobs, civilians types work.
wonderful people understood this. again, homegrown technology
people use? somebody hypothermic, going best way
warm up? going holding nice warm mug cocoa something like
that? not hot, guess, idea. - Yeah, well, actually can go hotter
glabrous skin. - Oh, it'll dilate? - takes heat away faster,
okay? back anesthesia, can can use warm pads.
hospitals, circulating water, perfused pads. - Hot water bottle
type stuff. - Put feet. Put feet. - typically slide
lower back something like that? - Yeah, put feet. Okay, sure.
will it. turns discovered work nothing
whole arm. hand. came realization
special blood vessels. didn't discover blood vessels described
"Grey's Anatomy," nobody knew for. - mentioned bears
earlier hairy animals. AVAs well? - Oh, yeah. -
suppose haven't defined AVAs. pretty good no acronyms rule.
AVAs is?



01:11:40 Paw-lmer Cooling Dog Health & Performance

- Arteriovenous anastomosis. connection arteries veins. Yeah.
- actually used technology. bulldog, bulldog mastiff. high
propensity overheating, terrible dumping heat. bulldogs
great pushing point exhaustion death. happens, now
call palmar cooling. Sorry, couldn't help myself. take Costello
lower cool body water. Just bottoms paws, although think
animals instinctually know will go stand bodies water. don't
often lie way. do. seem know great way cool
off. - Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah. - get advantage
palms feet essentially thing. - actually built devices dogs.
really? - tried on. lot sled dogs worked beautifully.
little backpacks equipment pads

01:12:45 Warming Up, & Varying Temperature Around Body

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies
across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can

cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just

across day. - Well, varies parts body. mean, hands arms
not 37 degrees right now. much lower, okay? [chuckles] - raises


interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

feet worked beautifully. - Amazing, amazing, along lines heating,
deliberate heating, wearing knit cap something see East
Coast: people run around Boston New England knit cap. always done
start runs try warm quickly. take off. shed
layers go. rational practice? way just described it? - Oh, sure. Yeah. -
Yeah? 'Cause warming important too. certain amount quote/unquote
warming required lubricate joints least get sense joints
lubricated able move easily. - Yeah. - still recommend
people warm up? - Yeah, think misled term warm major
purpose raise temperature. not aware data this, think
major contribution increasing flexibility. going avoid damage
joints tendons ligaments forth. also ability mitochondria
produce energy can impaired lower temperatures. keep mind
say body temperature's 37 degrees, not true. - Yeah. varies

normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

interesting question. best way measure core body temperature? - Well,
best core temperature that, use esophageal. put thermocouple
nose two feet esophagus. level heart.
- Not gym home-practical, although- - No. - don't know. COVID swab
tests go pretty far. can't even imagine going further. felt like brain getting
tickled. - tympanic pretty good. - ear? - ear. not foolproof
actually aimed properly tympanum frequently
getting getting sort mixture tympanic plus ear canal temperature. -
listening watching, tympanic not going pinna,
part ear, outer part ear. tympanic going heading towards
tympanic membrane. yes, sticking finger ear,
laser actually go measure temperature. - Right. -
walking restaurants places nowadays, shining laser
forehead, probably giving pretty crude readout temperature. - is,
much less insulation brain forehead skin
biceps arm skin. going measure surface temperature,
it. temperatures infrared. take infrared
videos athletes subjects. course face lights up. - Okay,
not, imagine going technology coming soon can point
smartwatch smartphone yourself, going get heat map. - Right,
right. - somebody hasn't already invented typical folks outside
military, somebody please invent that, think growing interest
temperature based work doing. also sake something
want touch on, sleep metabolism. Although don't want open
portals way, need several days cover it. Okay, putting
cap, helmets gloves used typical sports?
think can improved order improve performance terms
ventilation ability keeping palmar surfaces open instance? - Well,
mentioned knit cap cold weather, especially, significant,
lose lot heat head, constant heat loss. not variable like
glabrous skin. decrease heat loss, going warmer. So,
sure. impact. Now terms helmets, ventilated. mean,
enough space holes air can circulate.
don't want insulate, thermally insulate scalp. going decrease heat loss


quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,

- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue

completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

quite considerable. Just resting individual, brain 20%
metabolism.

01:17:35 Cooling-Enhanced Performance Permanent

lot heat production. - Yeah, absolutely, realized question
failed ask earlier burning mind now. think likely burning
minds listeners, is, cooling sets
gym, get performance enhancing effect. don't get delayed onset muscle
soreness, great. presumably body adapting. getting better
consequence able work per unit time go harder way
course. get adaptation. mean see performance-enhancing
effect, even don't cool, previously done cooling workouts?
instance, say can 10 sets 10 dips, like think can. maybe
need go try. dunno done recently. cooling. cool three minutes
sets. say get point can 20 10 sets, 10 sets 20
repetitions. don't cool. Will able match approximate new, better
performance? - keep gains. true conditioning effect. respond
increased work volume mechanisms mentioned. - [Andrew] Amazing.
- increase number contractual elements muscles. - Amazing. -
muscles get bigger. - Amazing. - experiment involved
female students. Not athletes, just regular, freshmen actually.
experiment 10 sets pushups muscle failure without cooling. -
regimen, three minutes cooling sets pushups? - Right. - Okay. -
young ladies reached 800 pushups. - Now total duration workout
getting much longer consequence work. - No. - No,
doesn't take longer. Well, minor, mean, push-up pretty fast. - Yeah. pretty
fast. - Yeah. 10 sets, maximum 45 minutes total. most- - lot
pushups. - lot pushups. - Yep. - interesting thing came
one day said, "Dr. Heller, cost us lot money." "Why?" "Well,
formal dance weekend. buy new sleeveless dresses."

01:19:55 Anabolic Steroids versus Palmer Cooling



- Nice. [Craig laughs] good problem have. Good problem have. talk
steroids, anabolic steroids. heading Olympics. Every time
Olympics rolls around, hear cases people getting popped,
call it, caught anabolic steroids. accusations there. Now
more. This'll get handled press various organizations. Clearly
athletes non-athletes use anabolic steroids. typically anabolic steroids
testosterone variety. derivatives, et cetera. derivatives
different things anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. typically idea is,
least understand it, talking individuals, allow people
train more, recover faster. able synthesize protein,
basically getting second puberty, know
puberty, lot growth body. course lot negative
effects abuse things banned various sports organizations,
especially, mention, combat sports, especially concerning,
combat sports, performance enhancement means can harm somebody
able otherwise opposed sorts sports. Just
conceptualize it. not taking moral stance this. just want ask you,
compare palmar cooling anabolic steroids terms gym performance,
see? - Well, not research steroids, [chuckles] lot
research literature. lot research strength conditioning magazines
not scientific. - No. - Okay? - might not even scientific all. - Right. -
Right. - analysis reputable papers find, think
probably eight nine, 10 studies bench press, increase bench press performance
steroids not, okay? - males females? - Well, males,
get back females, okay? bottom line independent
studies, rate improvement approximately 1% per week. - Okay. - Okay?
Now just told studies 300% increase month.
[Craig chuckles] So. - enormous, enormous difference. -
endanger health well legal ability compete ineffective
tool? - Yeah, no, think notion performance enhancement really interesting
one, people clearly pay attention nutrition. Sleep now something
think everybody, especially athletes paying attention to. - Right. - predict
temperature will one powerful parameters people going
focusing on. - Yeah. true. - magnitude effects


describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know

decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

describing also much variability around performance,
mentioned, go new environment, everyone home
environment worked pretty well. Sleep well bed home. can
control everything, performance always great. think military special
operators particularly interesting group, whole world centered
around elite high performance high risk,

01:24:00 Female Athletic Performance

high consequence variable conditions. essence work variable
unpredictable conditions. mentioned female athletes steroids. curious
this. - Yeah, everybody always said us, well, use male
subjects obviously testosterone background. higher levels
testosterone. get results. comparative study
females. get results. - Impressive, Stanford athletes also-
- No, not Stanford athlete, Stanford students. not athletes.
Well, done, course, work athletes. general, don't
research teams, varsity teams. protocols.
training program. - Yeah. don't like us get close them. work
folks coaches skeptical, good reason
also. reason ask see Pac-10 Division college
athletes, see peers, clearly difference, right? mean,
pedigreed throughout, right? typical folks also different goals.
may not want get infinitely stronger

01:25:18 Shivering & Cold, Metabolism

perform endurance work. want ask couple things
shivering metabolism, 'cause think interesting sufficiently related.
understanding shiver adaptation designed heat us up. - Yes.
- brown fat compartments around body activated
shiver co-activated shiver. shivering useful increasing metabolism.
true? require cold stimulus? two scenarios. give
experiment. put someone cold water sort, make get


stand near it, start shivering. understanding
metabolism will increase. take someone just shiver,
not exposed cold, kind deliberate shivering. Will also create
substantial increase metabolism? - Sure, deliberate shivering without cold
essentially happens get fever. set point goes
hypothalamus actually, even though normal body temperature,
thermostat telling cold, increase metabolism. shiver, right? So,
sure, shivering good way increasing metabolism, can take metabolism
maybe three four times resting. - Okay, seems like- - Whereas exercise can
take 10 times. - Got it. right. going ask couple random
questions

01:26:55 Studies Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat

seemingly random. bears actually hibernate? - Oh, yeah. - true hibernation?
- Well, depends define true. bear, actually, done lot work
bears. [Craig chuckles] - also put nose thermal couple
esophagus? - implant surgically. - anesthetized implant
them? - Yes. - Khat kind bears these? - Black bears. - Okay. -
colleagues University Alaska. analyzing data now,
done now total 18 bears implant EEG, EKG,
temperature sensors, sometimes actually measure oxygen consumption. -
bears wild? - bears wild, brought
University Alaska keep outdoor enclosure. hibernating
nest box enclosure, recording electrophysiological data
continuously six months. - Amazing. get protocol? [Craig chuckles]
[Andrew chuckling] Craig work together going forward. maybe
can slide onto protocol too, sounds amazing. - Right now, matter
just analyzing gigabytes, terabytes data collected. anyway,
asked hibernation. bears go 33, 34 degrees centigrade
core temperature. argued that, well, can't go lower
much insulation. big, surface volume ratio, forth,
not true. shiver, day like minus 40, get
Alaska, will go periods shivering. maintain core temperature


33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even

fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
want thank taking time busy schedule share information. -
Yeah, welcome. fun. lots fun. - certainly learned lot know
lot people going learn lot useful them.

33-34. Now ground squirrels marmots, smaller animals, will
drop body temperature maybe within degree environment.
can go one two degrees centigrade just freezing bouts
hibernation. stay hibernation seven eight days come back
normal body temperature day, go back down, another
about- - day warming again? go around-
- rearrange nests, eat, stored food. species store lots food.
Others just depend fat. - former mentor mine, master's degree mentor,
colleague friend yours, Irving Zucker UC Berkeley told story once,
told lot stories, tells great stories, know. told
animal comes hibernation periodically, dramatic thing observe.
not like wake yawn look around, like complete
epileptic seizure. - Right. - going on? - Shiver. - just traumatic
shiver. - low temperatures, cannot shiver effect
temperature conduction nerves muscle fiber. - shut
basically? - shut down. use brown fat. activate
brown fat get temperature maybe 15, 16 degrees
centigrade, shivering starts gets very, violent, still asleep.
- shiver sleep? - imagine do, probably wakes us up. -
Interesting, brown fat kind like kindling? - brown fat tissue
lots stored energy, 'cause fat, unlike white fat, regular fat, also
lots little powerhouses, mitochondria, lots blood supply. essentially
tissue just produce heat. for. Now hibernators,
big patches brown fat certain locations critical, like around heart,
example. us, brown fat sort distributed. many, many years,
thought humans don't brown fat, indeed do. just not localized
discrete fat pads, like ground squirrels, marmots. - don't know phrase fat
pads satisfying

01:31:10 Brown Fat Distribution & Activation Humans

say, fat pads. Speaking fat pads, taught have, internet,
say, taught internet brown fat scapulae
upper neck. truly source brown enrichment brown fat? -


ground squirrel. [Andrew scoffs] - drawings there? Okay,
hearing say brown fat actually distributed patch- - humans,
distributed along fat tissue. not discreet. - reason kind
shocked amused troubled somewhat standard
protocol performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever want call it,
putting ice packs upper back way stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
hearing inhales concern physiologist. tell why, sounds like
probably not best way stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, put
way- not attacking anyone specifically, whole little believes this. -
may not totally facetiae false. Think doing. put ice right
spinal cord close surface, going hit
vertebral arteries. essentially putting cold source brain,
hypothalamus. hypothalamus cold. going turn shivering
brown fat so. - better site sake activating brown fat? Palmar
cooling? - can't say activation brown fat sympathetic nervous
system response. lowering core temperature will let thermostat say
cold going turn sympathetic. Now people will perhaps different
amounts brown fat. newborn brown fat adults. - 'Cause
newborns can't shiver. Correct? - don't know. - Okay. read. don't know
true. read believe credible sources. - Yeah, be. just
don't know, depends really newborn, can agree don't
motor pathways connected yet. something occurs early days life
probably one functions REM sleep, infants lot of. - Right. -
Okay. activate brown fat consistently exposed cold?
live Arctic go jogging winter, maybe will increase
amount brown fat have. live tropics, maybe less brown fat.

01:34:18 Brain Freeze, Ice Headache: Blood Pressure, Headache

don't know. don't know studies looked that. - Okay. Ice
headache. Sometimes drink cold beverage eat ice cream head will- -
Brain freeze. - Brain freeze. speaking special forces, talking to, see
images SEALs, SEAL training slash screening Coronado
going Pacific, cold. know also spend time


cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

cold waters Kodiak, Alaska. mentioned Alaska. Brain freeze, so-called
ice headache, common occurrence situations.
experienced this. eat ice cream, get brain freeze. can feel right now
little bit subjectively. can induce it. going there? always just
rub tongue roof mouth. something
functional just try alleviate it? - Good question, thing roof
mouth close hypothalamus. indeed Popsicle giving
brain freeze, may direct cooling effect roof mouth
put tongue there, insulating roof mouth. don't know,
guessing. - source brain freeze? vasoconstriction? -
vasomotor change. Whether constriction, think likely increase blood
pressure, will essentially cause expansion arteries activate pain
receptors. don't pain receptors neural tissue brain.
meninges predominantly associated blood vessels, walls
blood vessels. something will dramatically increase blood
pressure going brain, likely get... preliminary data.
even hate mention this, not able pursue systematically,
experience people migraine say, use one
devices heat, migraine goes away. don't know. - Yeah. very,
lot people suffer migraine. know lot different types migraine.
reading lot lately, get many questions migraine
but. - hate say anything. - Sure. just underscore preliminary
people great understanding say preliminary, mean
not passed required filters call hard fact yet. - don't even
decent dataset. anecdotal report. - Yeah, anecdata, people like call it,
don't even like call don't want give weight
deserves, interesting. ice headache increase blood pressure
interesting thing heard similar something comes
from, competitions people eat hot chili peppers.
kind ego thing, guess, reasons escaped me, eating really hot
peppers. every while, someone will eat one get called
thunderclap headache, headache comes extremely quickly quickly
caused, severe rather known cause stroke brain damage.



01:37:50 Fidgeters, Non-Exercise Induced Thermogenesis

very, hot peppers, not acclimated them, maybe even
are, shown actually cause brain damage. Yeah. good evidence
this. want talk something not touched yet, NEAT.
Non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right? non-activity associated thermogenesis.
fidgeters, right? classic work like Rothwell Stock. idea
people overeat burning off energy way shaking knee
moving around lot. quote/unquote nervous types. quoted
studies, huge degree caloric burn, 800, 2500 calories per day burned
sit rather still. seem farfetched? older data comment
NEAT non-exercise induced thermogenesis? - Well, think pretty
straightforward increase muscle activity kind, increasing
energy consumption heat production. really extreme example hyper
hypothyroidism. People hyperthyroid fidgety high
metabolic rate hot. people hypothermic cool. don't
move much. kind muscle activity increases, say not
much activity, remember 20% effective. 80% energy going heat.
may not exert much energy tap foot. [chuckles] four times amount
energy going movement lost heat.

01:39:44 Pre-Workout Drinks, & Caffeine May Inhibit Performance

- interesting. couple quick questions. lot excitement
days least usage days so-called energy drinks pre-workout drinks.
Many contain thermogenic compounds. caffeine, things, culture
now taking arginine, things support arginine. beet juice L-citrulline, things
dilate blood vessels. Sometimes sake increasing blood flow
muscles resistance exercise. lot thermogenic, increase
body temperature. possible energy drinks actually,
similar, six espresso whatever is, acting prevent optimal performance
reduce performance? - don't think temperature rise that, really don't know,
makes jittery going increase NEAT
talking about. another thing. exercising


muscle becomes slightly hypoxic, mean oxygen suppliers not enough,
muscle releases adenosine. adenosine muscle cause
blood vessels open up, dilate. way increasing blood flow
muscle therefore oxygen supply muscle. - caffeine essentially
adenosine antagonists. - adenosine antagonist. Right. - strict logic,
ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release will reduce oxygen utilization
muscle? - Right. - lead believe that, motivational support aside,
caffeine will hinder muscular performance? - think so, can't give
authoritative answer that. - Okay, just going logic
gymnastics around that. think fascinating area deserves attention
question one can ingest order perform better, say nothing hormone
augmentation, often leads back stimulants. stimulants,
include caffeine sort, inhibiting adenosine system adenosine
system supporting oxygenation muscle, imagine avoiding
might better option. - Yeah, just, not aware data would,
general phenomenon adenosine blood flow. course, different effect
brain. Adenosine causes sleep. caffeine keeps awake. stay
awake, going higher metabolic rate go sleep.
thing say, energy drinks, question is, really them? - usually
cocktail things. don't take these, don't like all, usually
combination vasodilators, caffeine, sort stimulant. - source glucose
usually. - Sometimes source glucose sometimes not. oftentimes
vasodilators compounds thought so-called nootropics, smart
drugs basically increase acetylcholine norepinephrine transmission. 80s
90s, beta-3 agonist like clenbuterol popular, banned.
banned from, although people used recreationally, not
recommend.

01:43:42 Sleep, Cold, Warm Baths, Screens, & Socks

actually number deaths due dehydration, overheating, well
cardiac effects. wrap up, know done ton work sleep. think
going another episode work sleep,
amount data produce vast actually. first got know


work related sleep temperature. hear nowadays good keep
room sleep cool. Keep dark. talked number times podcast
episodes role light shifting circadian rhythms. two questions
related sleep. One is, things may may not relate temperature,
think useful getting better sleep, don't hear much
about, people might want consider try? Realizing lot reasons
people don't sleep great, things don't hear much
days wish people knew? - Well, sleep medicine community now
puts lot emphasis cognitive behavioral therapy pharmacology.
cognitive behavioral therapy essentially increases sleep hygiene.
certain just general rules. regular bedtime regular arousal
time. Don't skipping back forth time. - Arousal, mean wake-up time? -
Wake-up time, yeah. - Spoken like true physiologist. - Right. [laughs] Yeah, another
thing don't use screens within couple hours bedtime, screens
predominantly rich blue light. does, mentioned, circadian
system, affects circadian system. pushes off circadian stimulus
sleep, okay? Another thing course relax. mean, don't work right time
going bed. Take time something relaxing. temperature,
mentioned that. many people, warm bath really conducive good
sleep. people now swearing cooler environment sleep. makes
sense terms circadian effect body temperature. circadian clock
effecting thermostat. time go bed, thermostat way
lower set point, okay? happens? go bed feeling little bit
cool. pile lots blankets. happens wake little bit
later hot, throw off. thermostat set
downward. Now better cooler environment? better cooler
environment, easier thermoregulate. can go Europe
summertime hotel rooms still big comforters, comforters.
deal that? stick hands legs, okay? -
always slept with, one leg just kind hangs the, yeah. -
heat loss surfaces, right? cool environment, can take
advantage that. can take advantage passively regulating body
temperature. don't get wake say, oh God, got
change covers blankets, you. warm environment,


can do? - need sleep one hand CoolMitt. - Right. - Right?
right now not available yet. - Right. not available. - never heard
way. always heard want sleep cool room keep room cold. - Yeah. -
never realized useful, is, saying, can move
glabrous surfaces out. even also wake blanket
completely. - face. Yeah, yeah. - Very, interesting. finally rational
science grounded explanation need sleep cool room. 'Cause always
thought, well, temperature going anyway, sleep
cool room? wearing socks sleep? big years ago
said, put socks on. Now think probably wrong
advice. probably just- - Well, don't know wrong advice. old, old
study supported by, think, Eddie Bauer, sleeping bag company.
study showed, study asking temperature-sensitive
spots body? feel cold? showed toes. -
makes sense. sample water toe, always see that. [Craig
laughs] - socks essentially promoting thermal comfort insulating area
quite sensitive.

01:48:44 Synthesis

Now course, warm, not going put socks on. - Right, well, Craig,
thank much. gave much information actionable interesting.
know lot people going really interested palmar cooling technology
CoolMitt. will sure provide resources website people can
register interest. encourage people play around with, speak, palmar
cooling technology have, glabrous surfaces. also just
