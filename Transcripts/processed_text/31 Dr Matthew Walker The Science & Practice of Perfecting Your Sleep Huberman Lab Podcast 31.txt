now discussion Dr. Matt Walker. Great finally meet person. - Wonderful
connect. mean, long, suspect shorter time
met lest pandemic, thank coming up. - No, thank you, yeah,
delighted finally sitting face face. tracking work
internet sphere, read book loved it. also perspective
science, actually came Stanford couple years ago gave lecture
BrainMind. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - there, course, talked sleep
utility challenges conquer it, speak. start off
basic, sleep? - Sleep probably single effective thing can
reset brain body health. functional answer terms of, know,
sleep terms benefits. Sleep process though, incredibly
complex physiological ballet. recognize see happens
brain body night, sleep, blown away. paradox


us, think too, know, wasn't sleep scientist, go
bed, lose consciousness seven nine hours, sort wake
morning, generally feel better. ways denies
physiological biological beauty sleep. upstairs brain, going
different stages sleep, changes brainwave activity far
dramatic see awake. can speak deep
sleep happens there, REM sleep fascinating time, another stage
sleep, often called dream sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, stage
sleep parts brain 30%, active awake.
again, kind violating idea mind dormant. body just simply
quiescent resting. happy just sort double click either one
those, also changes body well. intense evolutionary
adaptive benefit system. said, though, almost push back
evolved system think question sleep sleep is.
assumption always evolved sleep. actually questioned
no way get time capsule go back prove this,
started off sleeping, sleep, wakefulness emerged?
assume way around? think probably really good
evidence sleep may proto state, basic fundamental
living state. became awake, were, always return sleep.
know, ways, point, sleep price paid wakefulness.
another way describing sleep is. again, think sort denies
active state sleep, not passive state sleep either. finally, can
say sleep across different species? us human beings,
mammalian species avian species well, sleep broadly separated two
main types. got non rapid eye movement sleep one hand,
got rapid eye movement sleep other. can speak
unfold across night architecture not just intellectually interesting
perspective sleep is, also practically impactful daily lives.
love sort go route too.

00:10:20 REM (Rapid Eye Movement) aka 'Paradoxical Sleep'

navigate, tell can. - No, no, definitely go route.


mentioned active brain is, certain phases sleep. coming
science, REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep referred paradoxical
sleep, still good way think it? Paradoxical brain
active, yet essentially paralyzed, correct? - Yeah, really paradox.
came simply brainwave recordings, measuring
you, brainwave activity, difficult sitting outside sleep
laboratory room figure out, awake, REM sleep?
two patterns brain activity close one another, can't discriminate
them. Yet, paradox awake, go sort sitting
up, clearly conscious awake. yet, go REM sleep,
completely paralyzed. one think part paradox.
paradox really just comes two dramatically different conscious states. Yet, brain
activity dramatically similar different. way can figure
two measuring two signals, activity eyes
activity muscles. awake, will occasionally blinks,
sort seek heads. REM sleep, really bizarre,
horizontal shuttling eye movements occur. name comes
rapid eye movements. - always horizontal? - Mostly, horizontal. -
interesting. - one ways can differentiate
waking eye movement activity, 'cause not always like can sometimes horizontal,
can also diagonal also vertical plane. muscle activity
real dead giveaway, just enter REM sleep, brainstem,
dynamics non REM REM essentially played
expressed upstairs cortex downstairs body, go REM
sleep, just seconds happens, brainstem sends signal
way spinal cord. communicates called alpha motor
neurons spinal cord control voluntary skeletal muscles. signal
paralysis. go dream sleep, locked physical
incarceration body. - Amazing. - know, Mother Nature
thing? ways simple. brain paralyzes body
mind can dream safely. think quickly
popped gene pool. know, think I'm, know, one best
skydivers can just simply fly, times dreams, too, know,
get apartment window, leap out. - done. - done,


know. one sort part paradox REM sleep, brain
activity similarity, despite behavioral state different bizarre
lockdown sort brain body itself. Now, course, involuntary muscles
thankfully aren't paralyzed. keep breathing, heart keeps beating. -
men erections REM sleep, women vaginal lubrication
sleep? - one reasons part reason though
autonomic activity. nervous, part nervous system called
autonomic nervous system, controls many automatic behaviors.
aspects reproductive facilities. REM sleep, later
discovered go bizarre call autonomic storms,
sounds dramatic, actually measure them. go
periods heart rate, decelerates drops blood pressure goes
utterly randomly, heart rate accelerates dramatically,
call fight flight branch autonomic nervous system sympathetic
nervous system, badly named 'cause anything sympathetic, aggravating,
sudden fires shuts again. not regular way.
get autonomic storms, get activated physiologic
perspective can erections vaginal discharge et cetera.
- totally paralyzed? - still paralyzed. two voluntary
muscle groups speared paralysis, bizarre. One, extra ocular
muscles, paralyzed, wouldn't able rapid eye
movements. later discovered inner ear muscle.
got no good understanding two muscles groups speared
paralysis. may something cranial nerve don't think that, think
perhaps something sensory related. people argued reason
eyeballs speared paralysis eyeballs left long
periods time, inactive, may get things oxygen sort issues
aqueous vitreous humor. eyeballs keep draining. - drainage
systems anterior eye made require movement. - Exactly. - People
glaucoma deficits drainage

00:16:15 Slow Wave Sleep aka 'Deep Sleep'

anterior chamber, speculating. also speculating, ask


this, imagine states waking also resemble slow wave sleep,
rather states slow wave sleep also resembles waking states.
beautifully illustrated REM sleep can mimic active brain
states achieve waking. sort waking state might
experienced experience daily basis might look similar slow wave sleep, non
REM sleep, any? - genius way thinking turns tables love it.
almost never see anything like true ultra slow waves deep non REM sleep.
spoke two stages non REM REM. Non REM subdivided
four separate stages, stages, one four, increasing depth sleep.
stages three four typically call deep non REM sleep. Stages one
two light non REM. - maybe take arc night just that. put
head down, well, you, time normally go sleep? - usually
sort around 10:30pm guy. usually naturally wake sort little bit
7:00, sometimes 6:45 7:00, alarm set 7:04am. - heard
here, folks Matt Walker use alarm clock. - rarely, rarely usually sort of. -
doesn't recommend it, use it. - Yeah, usually. - human all. -
Oh, human. sleep issues love speak too.
just, know, event that, know, 'cause like keep regularity
too. got keep two things balance. 7:04 just because, know,
not idiosyncratic. don't know always set things hot numbers.
yep you. - go sleep around 10:30, using example,
imagine number people go sleep different times. 10:30
go sleep, 11 me. go sleep 10:30, first, say
three hours sleep, architecture sleep look like compared
last three hours sleep morning? - Yeah, note sort
of, know, 10:30 7:00 just based chronotype preferential
different different people. not suggesting perfect sweet spot
humanity's sleep. just natural sweet spot. - imagine people probably
go sleep somewhere 10pm midnight. - somewhere 9
midnight. - probably wake 5am 7am 5:30 7:30. - Yeah,
yeah least look sort first world nations, typical sleep profile.
first fall asleep, go light stages non REM sleep stages one two
non REM. start descend deeper stages non REM
sleep. maybe 20 minutes, starting head stage three non


REM stage four non REM sleep. starting fall asleep,
cast off usually me, murky waters wakefulness, shallows
sleep stages one two, heart rate starts drop little bit.
brainwave pattern activity starts slow down. Normally awake, going
down, maybe 20, 30, 40, 50 times second. going light, non REM sleep,
will slow maybe 15, 20 really starts slow sort
10 eight cycles per second, eight cycle waves per second. starting
move stages three four, non REM sleep, several remarkable things happen.
sudden, heart rate really start drop. Oh, come back
temperature, going write temperature 'cause always forget things.
Now solidly foothills middle age. starting go deeper
stages non REM sleep, sudden, hundreds thousands cells cortex
decide fire together go silent together. remarkable
physiological coordination likes just don't see brain
state. - really interesting, recordings brains animals
little bit humans, don't think ever seen entire cortex even entire regions
cortex light like that. - Yeah, stunning. almost like beautiful sort
mantra chant, sort of, know, slow inhale meditative exhale,
inhale, exhale. waves just enormous size. - body
capable movement time, no paralysis. - no paralysis,
part, muscle tone also dropped significantly. - Interesting. - point.
will, will stay another 20 30 minutes. now
maybe 60, 70 minutes first sleep cycle. start rise back up, back
stage two non REM sleep. 80 minutes, pop up,
short REM sleep period, back down, go again, non REM,
REM. reliably, repeatedly, will that,
every 90 minutes. least average adults, different different
species. changes question ratio non REM REM within 90
minute cycle move across night. mean is, first half
night, majority 90 minute cycles comprised lot deep non REM
sleep, get stage three four deep non REM sleep. push
second half night, now seesaw balance changes. instead,
majority 90 minute cycles comprised either lighter form non
REM sleep, stage two non REM sleep, much increasingly rapid eye


movement sleep. implication sort speaking pragmatically is,
say to, usually never early morning flights red eyes, just
mess happens, not suggesting people shouldn't. -
suggesting people not not that. Every time taken red eye done two
three days later, get sort general feeling malaise, brain doesn't work
well, think red eyes abolished. pilots mean, the. -
can speak those, data. - emergency room, mean, long
shifts shown lead to, know, physician induced errors lead lot
fatalities. mean, lot reasons staying long,
wrong times, not adapted just terrible. - data
cases, know, particularly physicians recent data looking
suicidality. rates suicide training physicians are, know, far, far
norm. don't suspect that, know, schedules helping suspect
sleep missing part explanatory equation, but. - teach medical students
phenomenal, yeah, extremely challenged conditions. -
shouldn't put conditions. - [Andrew] No, not optimizing
performance, one. - sorry, sorry.

00:24:00 Compensating Lost Sleep

- No, no, important. important digression. one question,
saying across night, greater percentage 90 minute cycles
going occupied REM sleep progress night. aware
that, based work done public education efforts others
called circadian forces, forces driving
sleep want sleep, etcetera. Without going details those,
simple question, experiment following. say, God forbid,
prevented going sleep normal time stay four hours
five hours normally predominantly slow wave sleep. - say
finally get lie 3am time normally sleep occupied mostly
rapid eye movement sleep, will experience greater percentage rapid eye
movement sleep called circadian forces, meaning
appropriate time? will system need start beginning race
were, referring it, calling sleep? not clear


anybody, basically, asking is, forced skip slow wave sleep part
night, will system leap rapid eye movement sleep?
start beginning get slow wave sleep first? words, one sleep
state drive entry next sleep state? - Great question, degree
reciprocity sleep states note drive one up,
often not always see change other. pharmacologies
shown independence that. also played around things like
temperature, sometimes can, know, nudge one not seem upset
perturb other. your, think, lovely point, answer is, mix, mostly
latter. Meaning will mostly go REM sleep phases, significantly
deficient deep sleep. just start sleep cycle 3am, rather
10:30pm, doesn't mean brain just says, well, got program, just
going run program, way program runs always start
first couple hours deep sleep. just going begin act number one, scene
one, doesn't that. Now, will get deep sleep begin part
just sleep works. Based long awake, longer
awake, significantly greater pressure deep sleep. actually use
exactly just described experimental technique selectively deprive
people one stages sleep other. will first half night
deprivation, let sleep second half. means will
mostly deep sleep deprived, will still get mostly REM sleep.
switch it, get first four hours, means will mostly get deep
non REM sleep, will get almost no REM sleep. groups,
four hours sleep. difference terms
experimental outcome not sleep time slept
amount. contribution different stages. Now, actually
elegant methods sort selectively going scooping different stages
sleep. way used old school just using timing difference.
- suffers more? lack early phase, lack
later phase night sleep? words, sleep four hours
whatever reason, better off getting early part night's sleep second
half night sleep? - Depends outcome measure is. - gets right
differences slow wave sleep REM. - Right. - probably
misinformed. understanding crude understanding say before. -


much doubt contrary someone like you. - nice you.
first part night slow wave sleep restorative musculature motor
learning, dream content tends less emotional. second half
night, emotional dreams sort unpairing emotional load
previous day experiences. words, deprive myself,
excuse REM, hyper emotional, not maybe not settled kind
experiences life. Whereas deprive slow wave sleep, feel
physical malaise. correct? far simple? simple,
please tell wrong? - No, think much correct. sort
plus. example, deep non REM sleep, get this. almost
form natural blood pressure medication. take away you,
next day, usually going see autonomic dysfunction, usually going see
abnormalities heart rate blood pressure. also know deep non REM
sleep, certain control specific hormones. example, know
insulin regulation sort metabolism, meaning will look regulated
blood sugar perspective versus dysregulated, pre diabetic look profile.
deep sleep seems matter selectively deprive can see. - Growth
hormone. - Growth hormone different actually. beautiful demonstration
growth hormone seems REM sleep dependent. can
come effects alcohol really impressive frightening data
alcohol disruption sleep. also know testosterone, peak levels
testosterone happen REM sleep. - second half night, essentially. -
second half night. really just means the, profile
mental physical dysfunction will different conditions.
one prefer? prefer neither them. really depends
trying optimize for. just complicated, sleep just pluripotent,
know, physiologically systemic, almost impossible not undergo one
two things, just deep sleep deprivation, just REM sleep deprivation, not
show profile really prefer avoid. reason
evolutionary standpoint, preserved stages sleep. mean, sleep just
idiotic, know, evolutionary perspective. - maybe waking idiotic. -
waking is, know, well, yeah. - Based previous idea. - Who've
talking to? think comment specific me. Yeah, normally always
idiot working. think idea sleep, know, profoundly


detrimental us, take face value, know, not finding
mate, not reproducing, not foraging food, not caring
young worst all, vulnerable predation, one grounds
sleep probably selected against. wasn't sleep fought way
heroically every step along evolutionary path. therefore, every sleep
stage also survived best can tell. means non
negotiable. mother nature found way even just sort of, know, thin slice
sleep us, vast, sure evolutionary benefits,
looks though hasn't.

00:32:20 Waking Middle Night

usually favor wisdom 3.6 million years, so. - Yeah, incredible.
want introduce another Gedankenexperiment, thought experiment.
arc night, slow wave sleep predominates early night, REM sleep.
scenario many people including experience regular basis.
go sleep, sleeping just fine, three, four hours it, wake up.
wake up, whatever reason, maybe noise, maybe temperature isn't
right, will certainly talk sleep hygiene, etcetera. get up, go
restroom, might flip lights, might not, get back bed hopefully
not picking phone starting browse wake brain
various mechanisms light cognitive stimulation, etcetera. go back sleep,
say 10, 15 minutes, able fall back asleep. sleep till
typical wake time. detrimental wake episode event terms
longevity, learning, et cetera? love sleep entire night every
night, nights don't. yet, feel pretty good throughout day, days
better others. kind evaluate waking episode, compare
sleeping whole night through, thoughts that? - think
waking sort frequently, describing, probably get
estate order guess within next year, going going
done for, no kidding you. Absolutely kidding you. perfectly natural
normal, particularly progress age, know, children tend typically
continuous sleep. Now not aren't waking brief periods time
fact, do. come end sleep cycle


end REM sleep period 90 minute cycle, almost everybody wakes
make postural movement, turn paralyzed long
body will also like shift weight position. - ever look around? Ever open
eyes look around? - You, sometimes people will open eyes, usually
brief period time usually never commit awakenings
memory. situation situation well, usually now stage life,
don't sleep night. usually bathroom break come back.
perfectly normal. tend forget sleep science, think sleep
efficiency total amount time bed, much percent time
spent asleep? usually look numbers 85%,
healthy sleep efficiency. think going bed spend,
know, say, eight quarter, eight half hours time bed, normal,
healthy sleep efficiency, still may sleeping total seven half hours,
seven three quarter hours. Meaning going awake total, not one
long about, going awake upwards 30 minutes, net time.
Sometimes can 10 minute, know, dalliance gone
bathroom, just gradually drifting back off again. times, will just
couple minutes. don't commit. think need stop,
don't need get worried about, know, periods time awake, just
not sleeping throughout night. love that, too. remember
used happen, still happens occasionally. - Every while,
feels great happen. - lovely thing. - surprise right? Like oh
goodness slept whole night. - now surprise, yeah surprise.
part, think can relaxed
bit attentive, though, spending long periods time, not able get
back sleep. usually define saying, 20, 25 minutes, normally,
time really say okay, explore this, going on?
see happening. thing happening frequently, even
you're, know, not awake 25 minutes stretches, finding waking
consciously aware woken maybe six, seven eight
times throughout night sleep call fragmented great
science sleep past five 10 years yes, quantity important,
quality just important. can't one without terms good
beneficial next day outcome. can't just get four hours sleep, brilliant quality


sleep unimpaired. can get eight hours sleep, poor
quality sleep unimpaired next day. just sort want
asterisk, idea not get worried waking time
awake, perfectly normal natural. happening frequently
throughout night, periods time, long stretches time, upwards 25
minutes, look it. - Well, can assure just helped lot people feel
better waking episode many people experience. - hope
'cause think really important we, know, think desperately guilty
perhaps, know, early puritanical about, know, sleep
retrospected, tried explore case, know, almost
sleep else, dot, dot, dot. time starting write book,
back 2016, know, sleep still neglected stepsister health
conversation today. see the, - certainly changed. -
changing, know, not efforts,
colleagues. - say, well, great give attribution people
involved. course, big field. think done great service cueing
people importance state, not just avoiding troublesome outcomes,
also optimizing waking state. really, know, view sleep period
feels good, not aware feels necessarily.
tremendous benefits well, speak, tremendous
deficits not. think important thing cue people
issue. say mission accomplished, people aware need
sleep. think knowing waking middle night normal,
provided not frequent great will also help people

00:39:48 Uberman (Not Huberman!) Sleep Schedule

may overly concerned that. want use opportunity
raise something called Uberman schedule not confused
Huberman schedule. Fortunately, no one confused yet. years ago,
discussion called Uberman schedule, meaning Superman
schedule. Huberman without H, nothing with. read
Nietzsche will subtext. regardless, Uberman schedule,
understand one person elects sleep 90 minute, bouts spread


throughout day night, attempt get productivity reduce
overall sleep need. paper published recently explored whether not
good bad us. Maybe just give us take home message that. - Yes,
Uberman like schedules lots different forms that, tried
essentially pie chart 24 hour period, short bouts sleep shorter
no, well, slightly longer periods wakefulness, short bouts sleep
wakefulness. know, you're, sort made it, think quip, almost like
sleeping like baby, know, 'cause way babies will sleep. - 90
minute naps. - will have, know, brief naps, awake,
asleep awake. chagrin parents across night,
basically same, awake, asleep, awake, asleep.
schedule types protocols suggested.
really great comprehensive review found not weren't necessarily
helpful, actually really quite detrimental. almost every performance
metric, whether task performance, whether physiological outcome measures,
whether even quality sleep having, trying
get it, downward direction. not surprising look
way physiology programmed, look way circadian
rhythm programmed, none screams us sleeping
way. - Well, chuckling always hear sleep like baby. babies
sleep. say don't sleep like baby, sleep like adult adult, get
solid eight hours. - Billy Crystal's line, was, know, long standing suffering
insomniac, says sleep like baby, awake every 20 minutes. know,
think another one demonstrations fight biology,
normally lose. way know lost disease, sickness impairment.
think sleep, accordance natural biological edict
given, life tends higher quality longer duration.

00:42:48 Viewing Morning SUNLight

- Yeah, agree. Along lines, vision scientists, excited
work non image forming cells eye, called melanopsin cells
inform brain circadian time day. big proponent people getting
sunlight, ideally sunlight, forms bright light eyes early


day want awake. Essentially, phase 24 hour
circadian cycle temperature rising, starting get less light eyes
temperature going terms later day evening.
adjustments general theme like add? way? -
No, think exactly recommend right now. try get least 30
40 minutes exposure kind natural daylight. Now, may parts
world where, know, it's. - rather cloudy part world. -
Liverpool, England, Northwest England not known beach
resorts fine weather. remember sort of, went back home trip first
California, thought, sky low? Just know, constantly
joke UK, usually nine months bad weather three
months Winter. entire year terms climate. come
point, exactly right, try get daylight. Now can know, working
next window getting natural sunlight. natural sunlight even
cloudy day England usually far potent anything get
indoor lighting, despite thinking sort perception wise, maybe much
closer think. - Yeah, sorry interrupt. big
proponent app called Light Meter, will free app, nothing
will allow get pretty decent measurement amount light
energy coming toward you. hold cloudy morning, don't
think bright kind dismal day, notice there'll 1,000, 2,000,
even know, 5,000 Lux, Lux just measure brightness, course.
can point light meter toward indoor light seems bright
intense it'll say 500 Lux realize intensity gauge it,
perceptually not really system receiving. outdoor light key.
get natural stimulation? just say light stimulation early day,
typical, Matt Walker get light stimulation? - no
poster child, usually will, working usually work days.
shopped around found gym huge amounts window exposure facing
East. going sound ridiculous know, Matt Walker chooses gym
basis. - love - solar impact cannot know correct circadian. -
lot criteria selecting gyms, one actually grounded physiology,
biology so. - selfishness sleep. - No great. get
exercise light stimulation simultaneously? - right, yep, yeah. -


stacking cues wakefulness early day. - Exactly, exercise
daylight wonderful cues circadian rhythm alignment, also circadian rhythm
reset day. will use exercise, mean, neither strong morning
type strong evening type. preference exercise probably sometime
middle day, probably somewhere around 1pm sorry, not 1am. usually
working probably around sort seven, sort 45 8am time, usually
start workout. will start cardio spin bike facing window.
luckily, part California, usually sunlight coming through.
doesn't matter just said, even cloudy day Lux
coming light, intensity splendid. prefer favor exercise
just efficiency too, want get also working day, try match
exercise circadian light exposure probably going
really want crush workout, want just, know, make sure good
workout? prefer work out, know, different time. like
daylight. can speak exercise timing point,
lot discussion around that, right time exercise sleep.
can sort bust myths too. think spot suggestion, get
morning daylight, try get exposure, usually least 30 40 minutes,
great work recently coming occupational health domain,
moved workers offices just facing walls know, didn't
exposure natural daylight. time period study
actually front window working. measured sleep
sleep time sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically. forgetting
numbers now think increase total sleep time well 30 minutes.
improvement sleep efficiency five 10%. know, batting
80%, know, sleep efficiency average, bit concerned that. add 10%
now know, great echelon healthy sleepers.
just spend time working front windows. - great probably folks
might want consider spending little less time sunglasses provided can
safely, know, driving, etcetera. not alone exercise behavior
facing East. one Tim Ferriss told recently morning routine
nowadays consists jumping rope facing East get sunlight stimulation
eyes. Matt know, eyes, right? portals
way



00:49:20 Caffeine

convey rest brain body time day wakefulness. Along
lines wakefulness, number questions caffeine. dreaded
beloved caffeine, love caffeine, like relatively restricted periods time.
big fan waking even though wake groggy, allowing natural
wakefulness signals take hold, meaning wake slowly, don't drink
caffeine right away. sort delay caffeine little while, usually 90 minutes two
hours. idea came basis understanding caffeine
adenosine receptor interact. feeling going pronounce adenosine
differently do. - No, no, will that, will go adenosine. - tried go
skeletal instead skeletal synapse synapse. - Schedule schedule. -
go. make really simple folks, caffeine work make us
feel alert? timing ingest caffeine play important role
whether not works us us? maybe just start
caffeine work? drink mate coffee, preferred
sources caffeine, feel mental physical lift? - Yeah going suggest
counter people think, drink coffee. - mate, mate okay also? -
[Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form enjoy. - come sort
suggest comes coffee, say dose timing makes
poison. start caffeine works. Caffeine class drugs call
psychoactive stimulants. works variety mechanisms, one
dopamine mechanism dopamine often think reward chemical or,
dopamine also much alerting neurochemical, well. caffeine
role seems play increasing dopamine. principal mode action, believe
terms making alert keeping awake throughout day
effects adenosine. explain adenosine moment
woke morning, chemical adenosine building brain.
longer awake, adenosine accumulates, - mask, may
ask, accumulating neurons glia, blood vessels? also
accumulating body? adenosine coming from?
accumulating? - Yeah, adenosine talking creating
sleep pressure central brain phenomenon. comes neurons


combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get

much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep

naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.

reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want

profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal

engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.

us, think too, know, wasn't sleep scientist, go
bed, lose consciousness seven nine hours, sort wake
morning, generally feel better. ways denies
physiological biological beauty sleep. upstairs brain, going
different stages sleep, changes brainwave activity far
dramatic see awake. can speak deep
sleep happens there, REM sleep fascinating time, another stage
sleep, often called dream sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, stage
sleep parts brain 30%, active awake.
again, kind violating idea mind dormant. body just simply
quiescent resting. happy just sort double click either one
those, also changes body well. intense evolutionary
adaptive benefit system. said, though, almost push back
evolved system think question sleep sleep is.
assumption always evolved sleep. actually questioned
no way get time capsule go back prove this,
started off sleeping, sleep, wakefulness emerged?
assume way around? think probably really good
evidence sleep may proto state, basic fundamental
living state. became awake, were, always return sleep.
know, ways, point, sleep price paid wakefulness.
another way describing sleep is. again, think sort denies
active state sleep, not passive state sleep either. finally, can
say sleep across different species? us human beings,
mammalian species avian species well, sleep broadly separated two
main types. got non rapid eye movement sleep one hand,
got rapid eye movement sleep other. can speak
unfold across night architecture not just intellectually interesting
perspective sleep is, also practically impactful daily lives.
love sort go route too.

00:10:20 REM (Rapid Eye Movement) aka 'Paradoxical Sleep'

navigate, tell can. - No, no, definitely go route.


mentioned active brain is, certain phases sleep. coming
science, REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep referred paradoxical
sleep, still good way think it? Paradoxical brain
active, yet essentially paralyzed, correct? - Yeah, really paradox.
came simply brainwave recordings, measuring
you, brainwave activity, difficult sitting outside sleep
laboratory room figure out, awake, REM sleep?
two patterns brain activity close one another, can't discriminate
them. Yet, paradox awake, go sort sitting
up, clearly conscious awake. yet, go REM sleep,
completely paralyzed. one think part paradox.
paradox really just comes two dramatically different conscious states. Yet, brain
activity dramatically similar different. way can figure
two measuring two signals, activity eyes
activity muscles. awake, will occasionally blinks,
sort seek heads. REM sleep, really bizarre,
horizontal shuttling eye movements occur. name comes
rapid eye movements. - always horizontal? - Mostly, horizontal. -
interesting. - one ways can differentiate
waking eye movement activity, 'cause not always like can sometimes horizontal,
can also diagonal also vertical plane. muscle activity
real dead giveaway, just enter REM sleep, brainstem,
dynamics non REM REM essentially played
expressed upstairs cortex downstairs body, go REM
sleep, just seconds happens, brainstem sends signal
way spinal cord. communicates called alpha motor
neurons spinal cord control voluntary skeletal muscles. signal
paralysis. go dream sleep, locked physical
incarceration body. - Amazing. - know, Mother Nature
thing? ways simple. brain paralyzes body
mind can dream safely. think quickly
popped gene pool. know, think I'm, know, one best
skydivers can just simply fly, times dreams, too, know,
get apartment window, leap out. - done. - done,


know. one sort part paradox REM sleep, brain
activity similarity, despite behavioral state different bizarre
lockdown sort brain body itself. Now, course, involuntary muscles
thankfully aren't paralyzed. keep breathing, heart keeps beating. -
men erections REM sleep, women vaginal lubrication
sleep? - one reasons part reason though
autonomic activity. nervous, part nervous system called
autonomic nervous system, controls many automatic behaviors.
aspects reproductive facilities. REM sleep, later
discovered go bizarre call autonomic storms,
sounds dramatic, actually measure them. go
periods heart rate, decelerates drops blood pressure goes
utterly randomly, heart rate accelerates dramatically,
call fight flight branch autonomic nervous system sympathetic
nervous system, badly named 'cause anything sympathetic, aggravating,
sudden fires shuts again. not regular way.
get autonomic storms, get activated physiologic
perspective can erections vaginal discharge et cetera.
- totally paralyzed? - still paralyzed. two voluntary
muscle groups speared paralysis, bizarre. One, extra ocular
muscles, paralyzed, wouldn't able rapid eye
movements. later discovered inner ear muscle.
got no good understanding two muscles groups speared
paralysis. may something cranial nerve don't think that, think
perhaps something sensory related. people argued reason
eyeballs speared paralysis eyeballs left long
periods time, inactive, may get things oxygen sort issues
aqueous vitreous humor. eyeballs keep draining. - drainage
systems anterior eye made require movement. - Exactly. - People
glaucoma deficits drainage

00:16:15 Slow Wave Sleep aka 'Deep Sleep'

anterior chamber, speculating. also speculating, ask


this, imagine states waking also resemble slow wave sleep,
rather states slow wave sleep also resembles waking states.
beautifully illustrated REM sleep can mimic active brain
states achieve waking. sort waking state might
experienced experience daily basis might look similar slow wave sleep, non
REM sleep, any? - genius way thinking turns tables love it.
almost never see anything like true ultra slow waves deep non REM sleep.
spoke two stages non REM REM. Non REM subdivided
four separate stages, stages, one four, increasing depth sleep.
stages three four typically call deep non REM sleep. Stages one
two light non REM. - maybe take arc night just that. put
head down, well, you, time normally go sleep? - usually
sort around 10:30pm guy. usually naturally wake sort little bit
7:00, sometimes 6:45 7:00, alarm set 7:04am. - heard
here, folks Matt Walker use alarm clock. - rarely, rarely usually sort of. -
doesn't recommend it, use it. - Yeah, usually. - human all. -
Oh, human. sleep issues love speak too.
just, know, event that, know, 'cause like keep regularity
too. got keep two things balance. 7:04 just because, know,
not idiosyncratic. don't know always set things hot numbers.
yep you. - go sleep around 10:30, using example,
imagine number people go sleep different times. 10:30
go sleep, 11 me. go sleep 10:30, first, say
three hours sleep, architecture sleep look like compared
last three hours sleep morning? - Yeah, note sort
of, know, 10:30 7:00 just based chronotype preferential
different different people. not suggesting perfect sweet spot
humanity's sleep. just natural sweet spot. - imagine people probably
go sleep somewhere 10pm midnight. - somewhere 9
midnight. - probably wake 5am 7am 5:30 7:30. - Yeah,
yeah least look sort first world nations, typical sleep profile.
first fall asleep, go light stages non REM sleep stages one two
non REM. start descend deeper stages non REM
sleep. maybe 20 minutes, starting head stage three non


REM stage four non REM sleep. starting fall asleep,
cast off usually me, murky waters wakefulness, shallows
sleep stages one two, heart rate starts drop little bit.
brainwave pattern activity starts slow down. Normally awake, going
down, maybe 20, 30, 40, 50 times second. going light, non REM sleep,
will slow maybe 15, 20 really starts slow sort
10 eight cycles per second, eight cycle waves per second. starting
move stages three four, non REM sleep, several remarkable things happen.
sudden, heart rate really start drop. Oh, come back
temperature, going write temperature 'cause always forget things.
Now solidly foothills middle age. starting go deeper
stages non REM sleep, sudden, hundreds thousands cells cortex
decide fire together go silent together. remarkable
physiological coordination likes just don't see brain
state. - really interesting, recordings brains animals
little bit humans, don't think ever seen entire cortex even entire regions
cortex light like that. - Yeah, stunning. almost like beautiful sort
mantra chant, sort of, know, slow inhale meditative exhale,
inhale, exhale. waves just enormous size. - body
capable movement time, no paralysis. - no paralysis,
part, muscle tone also dropped significantly. - Interesting. - point.
will, will stay another 20 30 minutes. now
maybe 60, 70 minutes first sleep cycle. start rise back up, back
stage two non REM sleep. 80 minutes, pop up,
short REM sleep period, back down, go again, non REM,
REM. reliably, repeatedly, will that,
every 90 minutes. least average adults, different different
species. changes question ratio non REM REM within 90
minute cycle move across night. mean is, first half
night, majority 90 minute cycles comprised lot deep non REM
sleep, get stage three four deep non REM sleep. push
second half night, now seesaw balance changes. instead,
majority 90 minute cycles comprised either lighter form non
REM sleep, stage two non REM sleep, much increasingly rapid eye


movement sleep. implication sort speaking pragmatically is,
say to, usually never early morning flights red eyes, just
mess happens, not suggesting people shouldn't. -
suggesting people not not that. Every time taken red eye done two
three days later, get sort general feeling malaise, brain doesn't work
well, think red eyes abolished. pilots mean, the. -
can speak those, data. - emergency room, mean, long
shifts shown lead to, know, physician induced errors lead lot
fatalities. mean, lot reasons staying long,
wrong times, not adapted just terrible. - data
cases, know, particularly physicians recent data looking
suicidality. rates suicide training physicians are, know, far, far
norm. don't suspect that, know, schedules helping suspect
sleep missing part explanatory equation, but. - teach medical students
phenomenal, yeah, extremely challenged conditions. -
shouldn't put conditions. - [Andrew] No, not optimizing
performance, one. - sorry, sorry.

00:24:00 Compensating Lost Sleep

- No, no, important. important digression. one question,
saying across night, greater percentage 90 minute cycles
going occupied REM sleep progress night. aware
that, based work done public education efforts others
called circadian forces, forces driving
sleep want sleep, etcetera. Without going details those,
simple question, experiment following. say, God forbid,
prevented going sleep normal time stay four hours
five hours normally predominantly slow wave sleep. - say
finally get lie 3am time normally sleep occupied mostly
rapid eye movement sleep, will experience greater percentage rapid eye
movement sleep called circadian forces, meaning
appropriate time? will system need start beginning race
were, referring it, calling sleep? not clear


anybody, basically, asking is, forced skip slow wave sleep part
night, will system leap rapid eye movement sleep?
start beginning get slow wave sleep first? words, one sleep
state drive entry next sleep state? - Great question, degree
reciprocity sleep states note drive one up,
often not always see change other. pharmacologies
shown independence that. also played around things like
temperature, sometimes can, know, nudge one not seem upset
perturb other. your, think, lovely point, answer is, mix, mostly
latter. Meaning will mostly go REM sleep phases, significantly
deficient deep sleep. just start sleep cycle 3am, rather
10:30pm, doesn't mean brain just says, well, got program, just
going run program, way program runs always start
first couple hours deep sleep. just going begin act number one, scene
one, doesn't that. Now, will get deep sleep begin part
just sleep works. Based long awake, longer
awake, significantly greater pressure deep sleep. actually use
exactly just described experimental technique selectively deprive
people one stages sleep other. will first half night
deprivation, let sleep second half. means will
mostly deep sleep deprived, will still get mostly REM sleep.
switch it, get first four hours, means will mostly get deep
non REM sleep, will get almost no REM sleep. groups,
four hours sleep. difference terms
experimental outcome not sleep time slept
amount. contribution different stages. Now, actually
elegant methods sort selectively going scooping different stages
sleep. way used old school just using timing difference.
- suffers more? lack early phase, lack
later phase night sleep? words, sleep four hours
whatever reason, better off getting early part night's sleep second
half night sleep? - Depends outcome measure is. - gets right
differences slow wave sleep REM. - Right. - probably
misinformed. understanding crude understanding say before. -


much doubt contrary someone like you. - nice you.
first part night slow wave sleep restorative musculature motor
learning, dream content tends less emotional. second half
night, emotional dreams sort unpairing emotional load
previous day experiences. words, deprive myself,
excuse REM, hyper emotional, not maybe not settled kind
experiences life. Whereas deprive slow wave sleep, feel
physical malaise. correct? far simple? simple,
please tell wrong? - No, think much correct. sort
plus. example, deep non REM sleep, get this. almost
form natural blood pressure medication. take away you,
next day, usually going see autonomic dysfunction, usually going see
abnormalities heart rate blood pressure. also know deep non REM
sleep, certain control specific hormones. example, know
insulin regulation sort metabolism, meaning will look regulated
blood sugar perspective versus dysregulated, pre diabetic look profile.
deep sleep seems matter selectively deprive can see. - Growth
hormone. - Growth hormone different actually. beautiful demonstration
growth hormone seems REM sleep dependent. can
come effects alcohol really impressive frightening data
alcohol disruption sleep. also know testosterone, peak levels
testosterone happen REM sleep. - second half night, essentially. -
second half night. really just means the, profile
mental physical dysfunction will different conditions.
one prefer? prefer neither them. really depends
trying optimize for. just complicated, sleep just pluripotent,
know, physiologically systemic, almost impossible not undergo one
two things, just deep sleep deprivation, just REM sleep deprivation, not
show profile really prefer avoid. reason
evolutionary standpoint, preserved stages sleep. mean, sleep just
idiotic, know, evolutionary perspective. - maybe waking idiotic. -
waking is, know, well, yeah. - Based previous idea. - Who've
talking to? think comment specific me. Yeah, normally always
idiot working. think idea sleep, know, profoundly


detrimental us, take face value, know, not finding
mate, not reproducing, not foraging food, not caring
young worst all, vulnerable predation, one grounds
sleep probably selected against. wasn't sleep fought way
heroically every step along evolutionary path. therefore, every sleep
stage also survived best can tell. means non
negotiable. mother nature found way even just sort of, know, thin slice
sleep us, vast, sure evolutionary benefits,
looks though hasn't.

00:32:20 Waking Middle Night

usually favor wisdom 3.6 million years, so. - Yeah, incredible.
want introduce another Gedankenexperiment, thought experiment.
arc night, slow wave sleep predominates early night, REM sleep.
scenario many people including experience regular basis.
go sleep, sleeping just fine, three, four hours it, wake up.
wake up, whatever reason, maybe noise, maybe temperature isn't
right, will certainly talk sleep hygiene, etcetera. get up, go
restroom, might flip lights, might not, get back bed hopefully
not picking phone starting browse wake brain
various mechanisms light cognitive stimulation, etcetera. go back sleep,
say 10, 15 minutes, able fall back asleep. sleep till
typical wake time. detrimental wake episode event terms
longevity, learning, et cetera? love sleep entire night every
night, nights don't. yet, feel pretty good throughout day, days
better others. kind evaluate waking episode, compare
sleeping whole night through, thoughts that? - think
waking sort frequently, describing, probably get
estate order guess within next year, going going
done for, no kidding you. Absolutely kidding you. perfectly natural
normal, particularly progress age, know, children tend typically
continuous sleep. Now not aren't waking brief periods time
fact, do. come end sleep cycle


end REM sleep period 90 minute cycle, almost everybody wakes
make postural movement, turn paralyzed long
body will also like shift weight position. - ever look around? Ever open
eyes look around? - You, sometimes people will open eyes, usually
brief period time usually never commit awakenings
memory. situation situation well, usually now stage life,
don't sleep night. usually bathroom break come back.
perfectly normal. tend forget sleep science, think sleep
efficiency total amount time bed, much percent time
spent asleep? usually look numbers 85%,
healthy sleep efficiency. think going bed spend,
know, say, eight quarter, eight half hours time bed, normal,
healthy sleep efficiency, still may sleeping total seven half hours,
seven three quarter hours. Meaning going awake total, not one
long about, going awake upwards 30 minutes, net time.
Sometimes can 10 minute, know, dalliance gone
bathroom, just gradually drifting back off again. times, will just
couple minutes. don't commit. think need stop,
don't need get worried about, know, periods time awake, just
not sleeping throughout night. love that, too. remember
used happen, still happens occasionally. - Every while,
feels great happen. - lovely thing. - surprise right? Like oh
goodness slept whole night. - now surprise, yeah surprise.
part, think can relaxed
bit attentive, though, spending long periods time, not able get
back sleep. usually define saying, 20, 25 minutes, normally,
time really say okay, explore this, going on?
see happening. thing happening frequently, even
you're, know, not awake 25 minutes stretches, finding waking
consciously aware woken maybe six, seven eight
times throughout night sleep call fragmented great
science sleep past five 10 years yes, quantity important,
quality just important. can't one without terms good
beneficial next day outcome. can't just get four hours sleep, brilliant quality


sleep unimpaired. can get eight hours sleep, poor
quality sleep unimpaired next day. just sort want
asterisk, idea not get worried waking time
awake, perfectly normal natural. happening frequently
throughout night, periods time, long stretches time, upwards 25
minutes, look it. - Well, can assure just helped lot people feel
better waking episode many people experience. - hope
'cause think really important we, know, think desperately guilty
perhaps, know, early puritanical about, know, sleep
retrospected, tried explore case, know, almost
sleep else, dot, dot, dot. time starting write book,
back 2016, know, sleep still neglected stepsister health
conversation today. see the, - certainly changed. -
changing, know, not efforts,
colleagues. - say, well, great give attribution people
involved. course, big field. think done great service cueing
people importance state, not just avoiding troublesome outcomes,
also optimizing waking state. really, know, view sleep period
feels good, not aware feels necessarily.
tremendous benefits well, speak, tremendous
deficits not. think important thing cue people
issue. say mission accomplished, people aware need
sleep. think knowing waking middle night normal,
provided not frequent great will also help people

00:39:48 Uberman (Not Huberman!) Sleep Schedule

may overly concerned that. want use opportunity
raise something called Uberman schedule not confused
Huberman schedule. Fortunately, no one confused yet. years ago,
discussion called Uberman schedule, meaning Superman
schedule. Huberman without H, nothing with. read
Nietzsche will subtext. regardless, Uberman schedule,
understand one person elects sleep 90 minute, bouts spread


throughout day night, attempt get productivity reduce
overall sleep need. paper published recently explored whether not
good bad us. Maybe just give us take home message that. - Yes,
Uberman like schedules lots different forms that, tried
essentially pie chart 24 hour period, short bouts sleep shorter
no, well, slightly longer periods wakefulness, short bouts sleep
wakefulness. know, you're, sort made it, think quip, almost like
sleeping like baby, know, 'cause way babies will sleep. - 90
minute naps. - will have, know, brief naps, awake,
asleep awake. chagrin parents across night,
basically same, awake, asleep, awake, asleep.
schedule types protocols suggested.
really great comprehensive review found not weren't necessarily
helpful, actually really quite detrimental. almost every performance
metric, whether task performance, whether physiological outcome measures,
whether even quality sleep having, trying
get it, downward direction. not surprising look
way physiology programmed, look way circadian
rhythm programmed, none screams us sleeping
way. - Well, chuckling always hear sleep like baby. babies
sleep. say don't sleep like baby, sleep like adult adult, get
solid eight hours. - Billy Crystal's line, was, know, long standing suffering
insomniac, says sleep like baby, awake every 20 minutes. know,
think another one demonstrations fight biology,
normally lose. way know lost disease, sickness impairment.
think sleep, accordance natural biological edict
given, life tends higher quality longer duration.

00:42:48 Viewing Morning SUNLight

- Yeah, agree. Along lines, vision scientists, excited
work non image forming cells eye, called melanopsin cells
inform brain circadian time day. big proponent people getting
sunlight, ideally sunlight, forms bright light eyes early


day want awake. Essentially, phase 24 hour
circadian cycle temperature rising, starting get less light eyes
temperature going terms later day evening.
adjustments general theme like add? way? -
No, think exactly recommend right now. try get least 30
40 minutes exposure kind natural daylight. Now, may parts
world where, know, it's. - rather cloudy part world. -
Liverpool, England, Northwest England not known beach
resorts fine weather. remember sort of, went back home trip first
California, thought, sky low? Just know, constantly
joke UK, usually nine months bad weather three
months Winter. entire year terms climate. come
point, exactly right, try get daylight. Now can know, working
next window getting natural sunlight. natural sunlight even
cloudy day England usually far potent anything get
indoor lighting, despite thinking sort perception wise, maybe much
closer think. - Yeah, sorry interrupt. big
proponent app called Light Meter, will free app, nothing
will allow get pretty decent measurement amount light
energy coming toward you. hold cloudy morning, don't
think bright kind dismal day, notice there'll 1,000, 2,000,
even know, 5,000 Lux, Lux just measure brightness, course.
can point light meter toward indoor light seems bright
intense it'll say 500 Lux realize intensity gauge it,
perceptually not really system receiving. outdoor light key.
get natural stimulation? just say light stimulation early day,
typical, Matt Walker get light stimulation? - no
poster child, usually will, working usually work days.
shopped around found gym huge amounts window exposure facing
East. going sound ridiculous know, Matt Walker chooses gym
basis. - love - solar impact cannot know correct circadian. -
lot criteria selecting gyms, one actually grounded physiology,
biology so. - selfishness sleep. - No great. get
exercise light stimulation simultaneously? - right, yep, yeah. -


stacking cues wakefulness early day. - Exactly, exercise
daylight wonderful cues circadian rhythm alignment, also circadian rhythm
reset day. will use exercise, mean, neither strong morning
type strong evening type. preference exercise probably sometime
middle day, probably somewhere around 1pm sorry, not 1am. usually
working probably around sort seven, sort 45 8am time, usually
start workout. will start cardio spin bike facing window.
luckily, part California, usually sunlight coming through.
doesn't matter just said, even cloudy day Lux
coming light, intensity splendid. prefer favor exercise
just efficiency too, want get also working day, try match
exercise circadian light exposure probably going
really want crush workout, want just, know, make sure good
workout? prefer work out, know, different time. like
daylight. can speak exercise timing point,
lot discussion around that, right time exercise sleep.
can sort bust myths too. think spot suggestion, get
morning daylight, try get exposure, usually least 30 40 minutes,
great work recently coming occupational health domain,
moved workers offices just facing walls know, didn't
exposure natural daylight. time period study
actually front window working. measured sleep
sleep time sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically. forgetting
numbers now think increase total sleep time well 30 minutes.
improvement sleep efficiency five 10%. know, batting
80%, know, sleep efficiency average, bit concerned that. add 10%
now know, great echelon healthy sleepers.
just spend time working front windows. - great probably folks

00:49:20 Caffeine

convey rest brain body time day wakefulness. Along
lines wakefulness, number questions caffeine. dreaded
beloved caffeine, love caffeine, like relatively restricted periods time.
big fan waking even though wake groggy, allowing natural
wakefulness signals take hold, meaning wake slowly, don't drink
caffeine right away. sort delay caffeine little while, usually 90 minutes two
hours. idea came basis understanding caffeine
adenosine receptor interact. feeling going pronounce adenosine
differently do. - No, no, will that, will go adenosine. - tried go
skeletal instead skeletal synapse synapse. - Schedule schedule. -
go. make really simple folks, caffeine work make us
feel alert? timing ingest caffeine play important role
whether not works us us? maybe just start
caffeine work? drink mate coffee, preferred
sources caffeine, feel mental physical lift? - Yeah going suggest
counter people think, drink coffee. - mate, mate okay also? -
[Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form enjoy. - come sort
suggest comes coffee, say dose timing makes
poison. start caffeine works. Caffeine class drugs call
psychoactive stimulants. works variety mechanisms, one
dopamine mechanism dopamine often think reward chemical or,
dopamine also much alerting neurochemical, well. caffeine
role seems play increasing dopamine. principal mode action, believe
terms making alert keeping awake throughout day
effects adenosine. explain adenosine moment
woke morning, chemical adenosine building brain.
longer awake, adenosine accumulates, - mask, may
ask, accumulating neurons glia, blood vessels? also
accumulating body? adenosine coming from?
accumulating? - Yeah, adenosine talking creating
sleep pressure central brain phenomenon. comes neurons


combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

02:59:10 Connecting & Learning Dr. Walker

several which, not going incorporate. Matt,
amazing, deep dive sleep positive negative regulators. - hope hasn't
long. - No great. - Please cut down, shorten to, know,
five minutes meaningful stuff offered. - Absolutely not, chock block full
valuable takeaways. tremendously fun dissect incredible
aspect lives call sleep fellow scientist fellow public educator.
want say several things. First all, say people can find
although shouldn't difficult days. present internet. -
[Matthew] Unfortunately. - better worse. think wonderful
there. Look, public health service doing. No one requires
scientist get share information. sense knowing bit,
following work closely scientific work detail
public facing educational work much want best people.
interesting thing scientist clinician, know certain answers exist,
don't answers, better path, better ways
people can benefit myriad ways. So, that, know
genuine you, want best people offering tremendous advice
considerations people can take leave way view it. also want
thank taking time day sit

mentioned active brain is, certain phases sleep. coming
science, REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep referred paradoxical
sleep, still good way think it? Paradoxical brain
active, yet essentially paralyzed, correct? - Yeah, really paradox.
came simply brainwave recordings, measuring
you, brainwave activity, difficult sitting outside sleep
laboratory room figure out, awake, REM sleep?
two patterns brain activity close one another, can't discriminate
them. Yet, paradox awake, go sort sitting
up, clearly conscious awake. yet, go REM sleep,
completely paralyzed. one think part paradox.
paradox really just comes two dramatically different conscious states. Yet, brain
activity dramatically similar different. way can figure
two measuring two signals, activity eyes
activity muscles. awake, will occasionally blinks,
sort seek heads. REM sleep, really bizarre,
horizontal shuttling eye movements occur. name comes
rapid eye movements. - always horizontal? - Mostly, horizontal. -
interesting. - one ways can differentiate
waking eye movement activity, 'cause not always like can sometimes horizontal,
can also diagonal also vertical plane. muscle activity
real dead giveaway, just enter REM sleep, brainstem,
dynamics non REM REM essentially played
expressed upstairs cortex downstairs body, go REM

mind can dream safely. think quickly
popped gene pool. know, think I'm, know, one best
skydivers can just simply fly, times dreams, too, know,
get apartment window, leap out. - done. - done,


know. one sort part paradox REM sleep, brain
activity similarity, despite behavioral state different bizarre
lockdown sort brain body itself. Now, course, involuntary muscles
thankfully aren't paralyzed. keep breathing, heart keeps beating. -
men erections REM sleep, women vaginal lubrication
sleep? - one reasons part reason though
autonomic activity. nervous, part nervous system called
autonomic nervous system, controls many automatic behaviors.
aspects reproductive facilities. REM sleep, later
discovered go bizarre call autonomic storms,
sounds dramatic, actually measure them. go
periods heart rate, decelerates drops blood pressure goes
utterly randomly, heart rate accelerates dramatically,
call fight flight branch autonomic nervous system sympathetic
nervous system, badly named 'cause anything sympathetic, aggravating,
sudden fires shuts again. not regular way.
get autonomic storms, get activated physiologic
perspective can erections vaginal discharge et cetera.
- totally paralyzed? - still paralyzed. two voluntary
muscle groups speared paralysis, bizarre. One, extra ocular
muscles, paralyzed, wouldn't able rapid eye
movements. later discovered inner ear muscle.
got no good understanding two muscles groups speared
paralysis. may something cranial nerve don't think that, think
perhaps something sensory related. people argued reason
eyeballs speared paralysis eyeballs left long
periods time, inactive, may get things oxygen sort issues
aqueous vitreous humor. eyeballs keep draining. - drainage
systems anterior eye made require movement. - Exactly. - People
glaucoma deficits drainage

00:16:15 Slow Wave Sleep aka 'Deep Sleep'

anterior chamber, speculating. also speculating, ask


this, imagine states waking also resemble slow wave sleep,
rather states slow wave sleep also resembles waking states.
beautifully illustrated REM sleep can mimic active brain
states achieve waking. sort waking state might
experienced experience daily basis might look similar slow wave sleep, non
REM sleep, any? - genius way thinking turns tables love it.
almost never see anything like true ultra slow waves deep non REM sleep.
spoke two stages non REM REM. Non REM subdivided
four separate stages, stages, one four, increasing depth sleep.
stages three four typically call deep non REM sleep. Stages one
two light non REM. - maybe take arc night just that. put
head down, well, you, time normally go sleep? - usually
sort around 10:30pm guy. usually naturally wake sort little bit
7:00, sometimes 6:45 7:00, alarm set 7:04am. - heard
here, folks Matt Walker use alarm clock. - rarely, rarely usually sort of. -
doesn't recommend it, use it. - Yeah, usually. - human all. -
Oh, human. sleep issues love speak too.
just, know, event that, know, 'cause like keep regularity
too. got keep two things balance. 7:04 just because, know,
not idiosyncratic. don't know always set things hot numbers.
yep you. - go sleep around 10:30, using example,
imagine number people go sleep different times. 10:30
go sleep, 11 me. go sleep 10:30, first, say
three hours sleep, architecture sleep look like compared
last three hours sleep morning? - Yeah, note sort
of, know, 10:30 7:00 just based chronotype preferential
different different people. not suggesting perfect sweet spot
humanity's sleep. just natural sweet spot. - imagine people probably
go sleep somewhere 10pm midnight. - somewhere 9
midnight. - probably wake 5am 7am 5:30 7:30. - Yeah,
yeah least look sort first world nations, typical sleep profile.
first fall asleep, go light stages non REM sleep stages one two
non REM. start descend deeper stages non REM
sleep. maybe 20 minutes, starting head stage three non


REM stage four non REM sleep. starting fall asleep,
cast off usually me, murky waters wakefulness, shallows
sleep stages one two, heart rate starts drop little bit.
brainwave pattern activity starts slow down. Normally awake, going
down, maybe 20, 30, 40, 50 times second. going light, non REM sleep,
will slow maybe 15, 20 really starts slow sort
10 eight cycles per second, eight cycle waves per second. starting
move stages three four, non REM sleep, several remarkable things happen.
sudden, heart rate really start drop. Oh, come back
temperature, going write temperature 'cause always forget things.
Now solidly foothills middle age. starting go deeper
stages non REM sleep, sudden, hundreds thousands cells cortex
decide fire together go silent together. remarkable
physiological coordination likes just don't see brain
state. - really interesting, recordings brains animals
little bit humans, don't think ever seen entire cortex even entire regions
cortex light like that. - Yeah, stunning. almost like beautiful sort
mantra chant, sort of, know, slow inhale meditative exhale,
inhale, exhale. waves just enormous size. - body
capable movement time, no paralysis. - no paralysis,
part, muscle tone also dropped significantly. - Interesting. - point.
will, will stay another 20 30 minutes. now
maybe 60, 70 minutes first sleep cycle. start rise back up, back
stage two non REM sleep. 80 minutes, pop up,
short REM sleep period, back down, go again, non REM,
REM. reliably, repeatedly, will that,
every 90 minutes. least average adults, different different
species. changes question ratio non REM REM within 90
minute cycle move across night. mean is, first half
night, majority 90 minute cycles comprised lot deep non REM
sleep, get stage three four deep non REM sleep. push
second half night, now seesaw balance changes. instead,
majority 90 minute cycles comprised either lighter form non
REM sleep, stage two non REM sleep, much increasingly rapid eye


movement sleep. implication sort speaking pragmatically is,
say to, usually never early morning flights red eyes, just
mess happens, not suggesting people shouldn't. -
suggesting people not not that. Every time taken red eye done two
three days later, get sort general feeling malaise, brain doesn't work
well, think red eyes abolished. pilots mean, the. -
can speak those, data. - emergency room, mean, long
shifts shown lead to, know, physician induced errors lead lot
fatalities. mean, lot reasons staying long,
wrong times, not adapted just terrible. - data
cases, know, particularly physicians recent data looking
suicidality. rates suicide training physicians are, know, far, far
norm. don't suspect that, know, schedules helping suspect
sleep missing part explanatory equation, but. - teach medical students
phenomenal, yeah, extremely challenged conditions. -
shouldn't put conditions. - [Andrew] No, not optimizing
performance, one. - sorry, sorry.

00:24:00 Compensating Lost Sleep

- No, no, important. important digression. one question,
saying across night, greater percentage 90 minute cycles
going occupied REM sleep progress night. aware
that, based work done public education efforts others
called circadian forces, forces driving
sleep want sleep, etcetera. Without going details those,
simple question, experiment following. say, God forbid,
prevented going sleep normal time stay four hours
five hours normally predominantly slow wave sleep. - say
finally get lie 3am time normally sleep occupied mostly
rapid eye movement sleep, will experience greater percentage rapid eye
movement sleep called circadian forces, meaning
appropriate time? will system need start beginning race
were, referring it, calling sleep? not clear


anybody, basically, asking is, forced skip slow wave sleep part
night, will system leap rapid eye movement sleep?
start beginning get slow wave sleep first? words, one sleep
state drive entry next sleep state? - Great question, degree
reciprocity sleep states note drive one up,
often not always see change other. pharmacologies
shown independence that. also played around things like
temperature, sometimes can, know, nudge one not seem upset
perturb other. your, think, lovely point, answer is, mix, mostly
latter. Meaning will mostly go REM sleep phases, significantly
deficient deep sleep. just start sleep cycle 3am, rather
10:30pm, doesn't mean brain just says, well, got program, just
going run program, way program runs always start
first couple hours deep sleep. just going begin act number one, scene
one, doesn't that. Now, will get deep sleep begin part
just sleep works. Based long awake, longer
awake, significantly greater pressure deep sleep. actually use
exactly just described experimental technique selectively deprive
people one stages sleep other. will first half night
deprivation, let sleep second half. means will
mostly deep sleep deprived, will still get mostly REM sleep.
switch it, get first four hours, means will mostly get deep
non REM sleep, will get almost no REM sleep. groups,
four hours sleep. difference terms
experimental outcome not sleep time slept
amount. contribution different stages. Now, actually
elegant methods sort selectively going scooping different stages
sleep. way used old school just using timing difference.
- suffers more? lack early phase, lack
later phase night sleep? words, sleep four hours
whatever reason, better off getting early part night's sleep second
half night sleep? - Depends outcome measure is. - gets right
differences slow wave sleep REM. - Right. - probably
misinformed. understanding crude understanding say before. -


much doubt contrary someone like you. - nice you.
first part night slow wave sleep restorative musculature motor
learning, dream content tends less emotional. second half
night, emotional dreams sort unpairing emotional load
previous day experiences. words, deprive myself,
excuse REM, hyper emotional, not maybe not settled kind
experiences life. Whereas deprive slow wave sleep, feel
physical malaise. correct? far simple? simple,
please tell wrong? - No, think much correct. sort
plus. example, deep non REM sleep, get this. almost
form natural blood pressure medication. take away you,
next day, usually going see autonomic dysfunction, usually going see
abnormalities heart rate blood pressure. also know deep non REM
sleep, certain control specific hormones. example, know
insulin regulation sort metabolism, meaning will look regulated
blood sugar perspective versus dysregulated, pre diabetic look profile.
deep sleep seems matter selectively deprive can see. - Growth
hormone. - Growth hormone different actually. beautiful demonstration
growth hormone seems REM sleep dependent. can
come effects alcohol really impressive frightening data
alcohol disruption sleep. also know testosterone, peak levels
testosterone happen REM sleep. - second half night, essentially. -
second half night. really just means the, profile
mental physical dysfunction will different conditions.
one prefer? prefer neither them. really depends
trying optimize for. just complicated, sleep just pluripotent,
know, physiologically systemic, almost impossible not undergo one
two things, just deep sleep deprivation, just REM sleep deprivation, not
show profile really prefer avoid. reason
evolutionary standpoint, preserved stages sleep. mean, sleep just
idiotic, know, evolutionary perspective. - maybe waking idiotic. -
waking is, know, well, yeah. - Based previous idea. - Who've
talking to? think comment specific me. Yeah, normally always
idiot working. think idea sleep, know, profoundly


detrimental us, take face value, know, not finding
mate, not reproducing, not foraging food, not caring
young worst all, vulnerable predation, one grounds
sleep probably selected against. wasn't sleep fought way
heroically every step along evolutionary path. therefore, every sleep
stage also survived best can tell. means non
negotiable. mother nature found way even just sort of, know, thin slice
sleep us, vast, sure evolutionary benefits,
looks though hasn't.

00:32:20 Waking Middle Night

usually favor wisdom 3.6 million years, so. - Yeah, incredible.
want introduce another Gedankenexperiment, thought experiment.
arc night, slow wave sleep predominates early night, REM sleep.
scenario many people including experience regular basis.
go sleep, sleeping just fine, three, four hours it, wake up.
wake up, whatever reason, maybe noise, maybe temperature isn't
right, will certainly talk sleep hygiene, etcetera. get up, go
restroom, might flip lights, might not, get back bed hopefully
not picking phone starting browse wake brain
various mechanisms light cognitive stimulation, etcetera. go back sleep,
say 10, 15 minutes, able fall back asleep. sleep till
typical wake time. detrimental wake episode event terms
longevity, learning, et cetera? love sleep entire night every
night, nights don't. yet, feel pretty good throughout day, days
better others. kind evaluate waking episode, compare
sleeping whole night through, thoughts that? - think
waking sort frequently, describing, probably get
estate order guess within next year, going going
done for, no kidding you. Absolutely kidding you. perfectly natural
normal, particularly progress age, know, children tend typically
continuous sleep. Now not aren't waking brief periods time
fact, do. come end sleep cycle


end REM sleep period 90 minute cycle, almost everybody wakes
make postural movement, turn paralyzed long
body will also like shift weight position. - ever look around? Ever open
eyes look around? - You, sometimes people will open eyes, usually
brief period time usually never commit awakenings
memory. situation situation well, usually now stage life,
don't sleep night. usually bathroom break come back.
perfectly normal. tend forget sleep science, think sleep
efficiency total amount time bed, much percent time
spent asleep? usually look numbers 85%,
healthy sleep efficiency. think going bed spend,
know, say, eight quarter, eight half hours time bed, normal,
healthy sleep efficiency, still may sleeping total seven half hours,
seven three quarter hours. Meaning going awake total, not one
long about, going awake upwards 30 minutes, net time.
Sometimes can 10 minute, know, dalliance gone
bathroom, just gradually drifting back off again. times, will just
couple minutes. don't commit. think need stop,
don't need get worried about, know, periods time awake, just
not sleeping throughout night. love that, too. remember
used happen, still happens occasionally. - Every while,
feels great happen. - lovely thing. - surprise right? Like oh
goodness slept whole night. - now surprise, yeah surprise.
part, think can relaxed
bit attentive, though, spending long periods time, not able get
back sleep. usually define saying, 20, 25 minutes, normally,
time really say okay, explore this, going on?
see happening. thing happening frequently, even
you're, know, not awake 25 minutes stretches, finding waking
consciously aware woken maybe six, seven eight
times throughout night sleep call fragmented great
science sleep past five 10 years yes, quantity important,
quality just important. can't one without terms good
beneficial next day outcome. can't just get four hours sleep, brilliant quality


sleep unimpaired. can get eight hours sleep, poor
quality sleep unimpaired next day. just sort want
asterisk, idea not get worried waking time
awake, perfectly normal natural. happening frequently
throughout night, periods time, long stretches time, upwards 25
minutes, look it. - Well, can assure just helped lot people feel
better waking episode many people experience. - hope
'cause think really important we, know, think desperately guilty
perhaps, know, early puritanical about, know, sleep
retrospected, tried explore case, know, almost
sleep else, dot, dot, dot. time starting write book,
back 2016, know, sleep still neglected stepsister health
conversation today. see the, - certainly changed. -
changing, know, not efforts,
colleagues. - say, well, great give attribution people
involved. course, big field. think done great service cueing
people importance state, not just avoiding troublesome outcomes,
also optimizing waking state. really, know, view sleep period
feels good, not aware feels necessarily.
tremendous benefits well, speak, tremendous
deficits not. think important thing cue people
issue. say mission accomplished, people aware need
sleep. think knowing waking middle night normal,
provided not frequent great will also help people

00:39:48 Uberman (Not Huberman!) Sleep Schedule

good bad us. Maybe just give us take home message that. - Yes,
Uberman like schedules lots different forms that, tried
essentially pie chart 24 hour period, short bouts sleep shorter
no, well, slightly longer periods wakefulness, short bouts sleep
wakefulness. know, you're, sort made it, think quip, almost like
sleeping like baby, know, 'cause way babies will sleep. - 90
minute naps. - will have, know, brief naps, awake,
asleep awake. chagrin parents across night,
basically same, awake, asleep, awake, asleep.
schedule types protocols suggested.
really great comprehensive review found not weren't necessarily
helpful, actually really quite detrimental. almost every performance
metric, whether task performance, whether physiological outcome measures,
whether even quality sleep having, trying
get it, downward direction. not surprising look
way physiology programmed, look way circadian
rhythm programmed, none screams us sleeping
way. - Well, chuckling always hear sleep like baby. babies
sleep. say don't sleep like baby, sleep like adult adult, get
solid eight hours. - Billy Crystal's line, was, know, long standing suffering
insomniac, says sleep like baby, awake every 20 minutes. know,
think another one demonstrations fight biology,
normally lose. way know lost disease, sickness impairment.
think sleep, accordance natural biological edict
given, life tends higher quality longer duration.

00:42:48 Viewing Morning SUNLight

- Yeah, agree. Along lines, vision scientists, excited
work non image forming cells eye, called melanopsin cells
inform brain circadian time day. big proponent people getting
sunlight, ideally sunlight, forms bright light eyes early


day want awake. Essentially, phase 24 hour
circadian cycle temperature rising, starting get less light eyes
temperature going terms later day evening.
adjustments general theme like add? way? -
No, think exactly recommend right now. try get least 30
40 minutes exposure kind natural daylight. Now, may parts
world where, know, it's. - rather cloudy part world. -
Liverpool, England, Northwest England not known beach
resorts fine weather. remember sort of, went back home trip first
California, thought, sky low? Just know, constantly
joke UK, usually nine months bad weather three
months Winter. entire year terms climate. come
point, exactly right, try get daylight. Now can know, working
next window getting natural sunlight. natural sunlight even
cloudy day England usually far potent anything get
indoor lighting, despite thinking sort perception wise, maybe much
closer think. - Yeah, sorry interrupt. big
proponent app called Light Meter, will free app, nothing
will allow get pretty decent measurement amount light
energy coming toward you. hold cloudy morning, don't
think bright kind dismal day, notice there'll 1,000, 2,000,
even know, 5,000 Lux, Lux just measure brightness, course.
can point light meter toward indoor light seems bright
intense it'll say 500 Lux realize intensity gauge it,
perceptually not really system receiving. outdoor light key.
get natural stimulation? just say light stimulation early day,
typical, Matt Walker get light stimulation? - no
poster child, usually will, working usually work days.
shopped around found gym huge amounts window exposure facing
East. going sound ridiculous know, Matt Walker chooses gym
basis. - love - solar impact cannot know correct circadian. -
lot criteria selecting gyms, one actually grounded physiology,
biology so. - selfishness sleep. - No great. get
exercise light stimulation simultaneously? - right, yep, yeah. -


stacking cues wakefulness early day. - Exactly, exercise
daylight wonderful cues circadian rhythm alignment, also circadian rhythm
reset day. will use exercise, mean, neither strong morning
type strong evening type. preference exercise probably sometime
middle day, probably somewhere around 1pm sorry, not 1am. usually
working probably around sort seven, sort 45 8am time, usually
start workout. will start cardio spin bike facing window.
luckily, part California, usually sunlight coming through.
doesn't matter just said, even cloudy day Lux
coming light, intensity splendid. prefer favor exercise
just efficiency too, want get also working day, try match
exercise circadian light exposure probably going
really want crush workout, want just, know, make sure good
workout? prefer work out, know, different time. like
daylight. can speak exercise timing point,
lot discussion around that, right time exercise sleep.
can sort bust myths too. think spot suggestion, get
morning daylight, try get exposure, usually least 30 40 minutes,
great work recently coming occupational health domain,
moved workers offices just facing walls know, didn't
exposure natural daylight. time period study
actually front window working. measured sleep
sleep time sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically. forgetting
numbers now think increase total sleep time well 30 minutes.
improvement sleep efficiency five 10%. know, batting
80%, know, sleep efficiency average, bit concerned that. add 10%
now know, great echelon healthy sleepers.
just spend time working front windows. - great probably folks
might want consider spending little less time sunglasses provided can
safely, know, driving, etcetera. not alone exercise behavior
facing East. one Tim Ferriss told recently morning routine
nowadays consists jumping rope facing East get sunlight stimulation
eyes. Matt know, eyes, right? portals
way



00:49:20 Caffeine

convey rest brain body time day wakefulness. Along
lines wakefulness, number questions caffeine. dreaded
beloved caffeine, love caffeine, like relatively restricted periods time.
big fan waking even though wake groggy, allowing natural
wakefulness signals take hold, meaning wake slowly, don't drink
caffeine right away. sort delay caffeine little while, usually 90 minutes two
hours. idea came basis understanding caffeine
adenosine receptor interact. feeling going pronounce adenosine
differently do. - No, no, will that, will go adenosine. - tried go
skeletal instead skeletal synapse synapse. - Schedule schedule. -
go. make really simple folks, caffeine work make us
feel alert? timing ingest caffeine play important role
whether not works us us? maybe just start
caffeine work? drink mate coffee, preferred
sources caffeine, feel mental physical lift? - Yeah going suggest
counter people think, drink coffee. - mate, mate okay also? -
[Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form enjoy. - come sort
suggest comes coffee, say dose timing makes
poison. start caffeine works. Caffeine class drugs call
psychoactive stimulants. works variety mechanisms, one
dopamine mechanism dopamine often think reward chemical or,
dopamine also much alerting neurochemical, well. caffeine
role seems play increasing dopamine. principal mode action, believe
terms making alert keeping awake throughout day
effects adenosine. explain adenosine moment
woke morning, chemical adenosine building brain.
longer awake, adenosine accumulates, - mask, may
ask, accumulating neurons glia, blood vessels? also
accumulating body? adenosine coming from?
accumulating? - Yeah, adenosine talking creating
sleep pressure central brain phenomenon. comes neurons


combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

02:59:10 Connecting & Learning Dr. Walker

00:16:15 Slow Wave Sleep aka 'Deep Sleep'

anterior chamber, speculating. also speculating, ask


this, imagine states waking also resemble slow wave sleep,
rather states slow wave sleep also resembles waking states.
beautifully illustrated REM sleep can mimic active brain
states achieve waking. sort waking state might
experienced experience daily basis might look similar slow wave sleep, non
REM sleep, any? - genius way thinking turns tables love it.
almost never see anything like true ultra slow waves deep non REM sleep.
spoke two stages non REM REM. Non REM subdivided
four separate stages, stages, one four, increasing depth sleep.
stages three four typically call deep non REM sleep. Stages one
two light non REM. - maybe take arc night just that. put
head down, well, you, time normally go sleep? - usually
sort around 10:30pm guy. usually naturally wake sort little bit
7:00, sometimes 6:45 7:00, alarm set 7:04am. - heard
here, folks Matt Walker use alarm clock. - rarely, rarely usually sort of. -
doesn't recommend it, use it. - Yeah, usually. - human all. -
Oh, human. sleep issues love speak too.
just, know, event that, know, 'cause like keep regularity
too. got keep two things balance. 7:04 just because, know,
not idiosyncratic. don't know always set things hot numbers.
yep you. - go sleep around 10:30, using example,
imagine number people go sleep different times. 10:30
go sleep, 11 me. go sleep 10:30, first, say
three hours sleep, architecture sleep look like compared
last three hours sleep morning? - Yeah, note sort
of, know, 10:30 7:00 just based chronotype preferential
different different people. not suggesting perfect sweet spot
humanity's sleep. just natural sweet spot. - imagine people probably
go sleep somewhere 10pm midnight. - somewhere 9
midnight. - probably wake 5am 7am 5:30 7:30. - Yeah,
yeah least look sort first world nations, typical sleep profile.
first fall asleep, go light stages non REM sleep stages one two
non REM. start descend deeper stages non REM
sleep. maybe 20 minutes, starting head stage three non


REM stage four non REM sleep. starting fall asleep,
cast off usually me, murky waters wakefulness, shallows
sleep stages one two, heart rate starts drop little bit.
brainwave pattern activity starts slow down. Normally awake, going
down, maybe 20, 30, 40, 50 times second. going light, non REM sleep,
will slow maybe 15, 20 really starts slow sort
10 eight cycles per second, eight cycle waves per second. starting
move stages three four, non REM sleep, several remarkable things happen.
sudden, heart rate really start drop. Oh, come back
temperature, going write temperature 'cause always forget things.
Now solidly foothills middle age. starting go deeper

movement sleep. implication sort speaking pragmatically is,
say to, usually never early morning flights red eyes, just
mess happens, not suggesting people shouldn't. -
suggesting people not not that. Every time taken red eye done two
three days later, get sort general feeling malaise, brain doesn't work
well, think red eyes abolished. pilots mean, the. -
can speak those, data. - emergency room, mean, long
shifts shown lead to, know, physician induced errors lead lot
fatalities. mean, lot reasons staying long,
wrong times, not adapted just terrible. - data
cases, know, particularly physicians recent data looking
suicidality. rates suicide training physicians are, know, far, far
norm. don't suspect that, know, schedules helping suspect
sleep missing part explanatory equation, but. - teach medical students
phenomenal, yeah, extremely challenged conditions. -
shouldn't put conditions. - [Andrew] No, not optimizing
performance, one. - sorry, sorry.

00:24:00 Compensating Lost Sleep

- No, no, important. important digression. one question,
saying across night, greater percentage 90 minute cycles
going occupied REM sleep progress night. aware
that, based work done public education efforts others
called circadian forces, forces driving
sleep want sleep, etcetera. Without going details those,
simple question, experiment following. say, God forbid,
prevented going sleep normal time stay four hours
five hours normally predominantly slow wave sleep. - say
finally get lie 3am time normally sleep occupied mostly
rapid eye movement sleep, will experience greater percentage rapid eye
movement sleep called circadian forces, meaning
appropriate time? will system need start beginning race
were, referring it, calling sleep? not clear


anybody, basically, asking is, forced skip slow wave sleep part
night, will system leap rapid eye movement sleep?
start beginning get slow wave sleep first? words, one sleep
state drive entry next sleep state? - Great question, degree
reciprocity sleep states note drive one up,
often not always see change other. pharmacologies
shown independence that. also played around things like
temperature, sometimes can, know, nudge one not seem upset
perturb other. your, think, lovely point, answer is, mix, mostly
latter. Meaning will mostly go REM sleep phases, significantly
deficient deep sleep. just start sleep cycle 3am, rather
10:30pm, doesn't mean brain just says, well, got program, just
going run program, way program runs always start
first couple hours deep sleep. just going begin act number one, scene
one, doesn't that. Now, will get deep sleep begin part
just sleep works. Based long awake, longer
awake, significantly greater pressure deep sleep. actually use
exactly just described experimental technique selectively deprive
people one stages sleep other. will first half night
deprivation, let sleep second half. means will
mostly deep sleep deprived, will still get mostly REM sleep.
switch it, get first four hours, means will mostly get deep
non REM sleep, will get almost no REM sleep. groups,
four hours sleep. difference terms
experimental outcome not sleep time slept
amount. contribution different stages. Now, actually
elegant methods sort selectively going scooping different stages
sleep. way used old school just using timing difference.
- suffers more? lack early phase, lack
later phase night sleep? words, sleep four hours
whatever reason, better off getting early part night's sleep second
half night sleep? - Depends outcome measure is. - gets right
differences slow wave sleep REM. - Right. - probably
misinformed. understanding crude understanding say before. -


much doubt contrary someone like you. - nice you.
first part night slow wave sleep restorative musculature motor
learning, dream content tends less emotional. second half
night, emotional dreams sort unpairing emotional load
previous day experiences. words, deprive myself,
excuse REM, hyper emotional, not maybe not settled kind
experiences life. Whereas deprive slow wave sleep, feel
physical malaise. correct? far simple? simple,
please tell wrong? - No, think much correct. sort
plus. example, deep non REM sleep, get this. almost
form natural blood pressure medication. take away you,
next day, usually going see autonomic dysfunction, usually going see
abnormalities heart rate blood pressure. also know deep non REM
sleep, certain control specific hormones. example, know
insulin regulation sort metabolism, meaning will look regulated
blood sugar perspective versus dysregulated, pre diabetic look profile.
deep sleep seems matter selectively deprive can see. - Growth
hormone. - Growth hormone different actually. beautiful demonstration
growth hormone seems REM sleep dependent. can
come effects alcohol really impressive frightening data
alcohol disruption sleep. also know testosterone, peak levels
testosterone happen REM sleep. - second half night, essentially. -
second half night. really just means the, profile
mental physical dysfunction will different conditions.
one prefer? prefer neither them. really depends
trying optimize for. just complicated, sleep just pluripotent,
know, physiologically systemic, almost impossible not undergo one
two things, just deep sleep deprivation, just REM sleep deprivation, not
show profile really prefer avoid. reason
evolutionary standpoint, preserved stages sleep. mean, sleep just
idiotic, know, evolutionary perspective. - maybe waking idiotic. -
waking is, know, well, yeah. - Based previous idea. - Who've
talking to? think comment specific me. Yeah, normally always
idiot working. think idea sleep, know, profoundly


detrimental us, take face value, know, not finding
mate, not reproducing, not foraging food, not caring
young worst all, vulnerable predation, one grounds
sleep probably selected against. wasn't sleep fought way
heroically every step along evolutionary path. therefore, every sleep
stage also survived best can tell. means non
negotiable. mother nature found way even just sort of, know, thin slice
sleep us, vast, sure evolutionary benefits,
looks though hasn't.

00:32:20 Waking Middle Night

usually favor wisdom 3.6 million years, so. - Yeah, incredible.
want introduce another Gedankenexperiment, thought experiment.
arc night, slow wave sleep predominates early night, REM sleep.
scenario many people including experience regular basis.
go sleep, sleeping just fine, three, four hours it, wake up.
wake up, whatever reason, maybe noise, maybe temperature isn't
right, will certainly talk sleep hygiene, etcetera. get up, go
restroom, might flip lights, might not, get back bed hopefully
not picking phone starting browse wake brain
various mechanisms light cognitive stimulation, etcetera. go back sleep,
say 10, 15 minutes, able fall back asleep. sleep till
typical wake time. detrimental wake episode event terms
longevity, learning, et cetera? love sleep entire night every
night, nights don't. yet, feel pretty good throughout day, days
better others. kind evaluate waking episode, compare
sleeping whole night through, thoughts that? - think
waking sort frequently, describing, probably get
estate order guess within next year, going going
done for, no kidding you. Absolutely kidding you. perfectly natural
normal, particularly progress age, know, children tend typically
continuous sleep. Now not aren't waking brief periods time
fact, do. come end sleep cycle


end REM sleep period 90 minute cycle, almost everybody wakes
make postural movement, turn paralyzed long
body will also like shift weight position. - ever look around? Ever open
eyes look around? - You, sometimes people will open eyes, usually
brief period time usually never commit awakenings
memory. situation situation well, usually now stage life,
don't sleep night. usually bathroom break come back.
perfectly normal. tend forget sleep science, think sleep
efficiency total amount time bed, much percent time
spent asleep? usually look numbers 85%,
healthy sleep efficiency. think going bed spend,
know, say, eight quarter, eight half hours time bed, normal,
healthy sleep efficiency, still may sleeping total seven half hours,
seven three quarter hours. Meaning going awake total, not one
long about, going awake upwards 30 minutes, net time.
Sometimes can 10 minute, know, dalliance gone
bathroom, just gradually drifting back off again. times, will just
couple minutes. don't commit. think need stop,
don't need get worried about, know, periods time awake, just
not sleeping throughout night. love that, too. remember
used happen, still happens occasionally. - Every while,
feels great happen. - lovely thing. - surprise right? Like oh
goodness slept whole night. - now surprise, yeah surprise.
part, think can relaxed
bit attentive, though, spending long periods time, not able get
back sleep. usually define saying, 20, 25 minutes, normally,
time really say okay, explore this, going on?
see happening. thing happening frequently, even
you're, know, not awake 25 minutes stretches, finding waking
consciously aware woken maybe six, seven eight
times throughout night sleep call fragmented great
science sleep past five 10 years yes, quantity important,
quality just important. can't one without terms good
beneficial next day outcome. can't just get four hours sleep, brilliant quality


sleep unimpaired. can get eight hours sleep, poor
quality sleep unimpaired next day. just sort want
asterisk, idea not get worried waking time
awake, perfectly normal natural. happening frequently
throughout night, periods time, long stretches time, upwards 25
minutes, look it. - Well, can assure just helped lot people feel
better waking episode many people experience. - hope
'cause think really important we, know, think desperately guilty
perhaps, know, early puritanical about, know, sleep
retrospected, tried explore case, know, almost
sleep else, dot, dot, dot. time starting write book,
back 2016, know, sleep still neglected stepsister health
conversation today. see the, - certainly changed. -
changing, know, not efforts,
colleagues. - say, well, great give attribution people
involved. course, big field. think done great service cueing
people importance state, not just avoiding troublesome outcomes,
also optimizing waking state. really, know, view sleep period
feels good, not aware feels necessarily.
tremendous benefits well, speak, tremendous
deficits not. think important thing cue people
issue. say mission accomplished, people aware need
sleep. think knowing waking middle night normal,
provided not frequent great will also help people

00:39:48 Uberman (Not Huberman!) Sleep Schedule

may overly concerned that. want use opportunity
raise something called Uberman schedule not confused
Huberman schedule. Fortunately, no one confused yet. years ago,
discussion called Uberman schedule, meaning Superman
schedule. Huberman without H, nothing with. read
Nietzsche will subtext. regardless, Uberman schedule,
understand one person elects sleep 90 minute, bouts spread


throughout day night, attempt get productivity reduce
overall sleep need. paper published recently explored whether not
good bad us. Maybe just give us take home message that. - Yes,
Uberman like schedules lots different forms that, tried
essentially pie chart 24 hour period, short bouts sleep shorter
no, well, slightly longer periods wakefulness, short bouts sleep
wakefulness. know, you're, sort made it, think quip, almost like
sleeping like baby, know, 'cause way babies will sleep. - 90
minute naps. - will have, know, brief naps, awake,
asleep awake. chagrin parents across night,
basically same, awake, asleep, awake, asleep.
schedule types protocols suggested.
really great comprehensive review found not weren't necessarily
helpful, actually really quite detrimental. almost every performance
metric, whether task performance, whether physiological outcome measures,
whether even quality sleep having, trying
get it, downward direction. not surprising look
way physiology programmed, look way circadian
rhythm programmed, none screams us sleeping
way. - Well, chuckling always hear sleep like baby. babies
sleep. say don't sleep like baby, sleep like adult adult, get
solid eight hours. - Billy Crystal's line, was, know, long standing suffering
insomniac, says sleep like baby, awake every 20 minutes. know,
think another one demonstrations fight biology,
normally lose. way know lost disease, sickness impairment.
think sleep, accordance natural biological edict
given, life tends higher quality longer duration.

00:42:48 Viewing Morning SUNLight

- Yeah, agree. Along lines, vision scientists, excited
work non image forming cells eye, called melanopsin cells
inform brain circadian time day. big proponent people getting
sunlight, ideally sunlight, forms bright light eyes early


day want awake. Essentially, phase 24 hour
circadian cycle temperature rising, starting get less light eyes
temperature going terms later day evening.
adjustments general theme like add? way? -
No, think exactly recommend right now. try get least 30
40 minutes exposure kind natural daylight. Now, may parts
world where, know, it's. - rather cloudy part world. -
Liverpool, England, Northwest England not known beach
resorts fine weather. remember sort of, went back home trip first
California, thought, sky low? Just know, constantly
joke UK, usually nine months bad weather three
months Winter. entire year terms climate. come
point, exactly right, try get daylight. Now can know, working
next window getting natural sunlight. natural sunlight even
cloudy day England usually far potent anything get
indoor lighting, despite thinking sort perception wise, maybe much
closer think. - Yeah, sorry interrupt. big
proponent app called Light Meter, will free app, nothing
will allow get pretty decent measurement amount light
energy coming toward you. hold cloudy morning, don't
think bright kind dismal day, notice there'll 1,000, 2,000,
even know, 5,000 Lux, Lux just measure brightness, course.
can point light meter toward indoor light seems bright
intense it'll say 500 Lux realize intensity gauge it,
perceptually not really system receiving. outdoor light key.
get natural stimulation? just say light stimulation early day,
typical, Matt Walker get light stimulation? - no
poster child, usually will, working usually work days.
shopped around found gym huge amounts window exposure facing
East. going sound ridiculous know, Matt Walker chooses gym
basis. - love - solar impact cannot know correct circadian. -
lot criteria selecting gyms, one actually grounded physiology,
biology so. - selfishness sleep. - No great. get
exercise light stimulation simultaneously? - right, yep, yeah. -


stacking cues wakefulness early day. - Exactly, exercise
daylight wonderful cues circadian rhythm alignment, also circadian rhythm
reset day. will use exercise, mean, neither strong morning
type strong evening type. preference exercise probably sometime
middle day, probably somewhere around 1pm sorry, not 1am. usually
working probably around sort seven, sort 45 8am time, usually
start workout. will start cardio spin bike facing window.
luckily, part California, usually sunlight coming through.
doesn't matter just said, even cloudy day Lux
coming light, intensity splendid. prefer favor exercise
just efficiency too, want get also working day, try match
exercise circadian light exposure probably going
really want crush workout, want just, know, make sure good
workout? prefer work out, know, different time. like
daylight. can speak exercise timing point,
lot discussion around that, right time exercise sleep.
can sort bust myths too. think spot suggestion, get
morning daylight, try get exposure, usually least 30 40 minutes,
great work recently coming occupational health domain,
moved workers offices just facing walls know, didn't
exposure natural daylight. time period study
actually front window working. measured sleep
sleep time sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically. forgetting
numbers now think increase total sleep time well 30 minutes.
improvement sleep efficiency five 10%. know, batting
80%, know, sleep efficiency average, bit concerned that. add 10%
now know, great echelon healthy sleepers.
just spend time working front windows. - great probably folks
might want consider spending little less time sunglasses provided can
safely, know, driving, etcetera. not alone exercise behavior
facing East. one Tim Ferriss told recently morning routine
nowadays consists jumping rope facing East get sunlight stimulation
eyes. Matt know, eyes, right? portals
way



00:49:20 Caffeine

convey rest brain body time day wakefulness. Along
lines wakefulness, number questions caffeine. dreaded
beloved caffeine, love caffeine, like relatively restricted periods time.
big fan waking even though wake groggy, allowing natural
wakefulness signals take hold, meaning wake slowly, don't drink
caffeine right away. sort delay caffeine little while, usually 90 minutes two
hours. idea came basis understanding caffeine
adenosine receptor interact. feeling going pronounce adenosine
differently do. - No, no, will that, will go adenosine. - tried go
skeletal instead skeletal synapse synapse. - Schedule schedule. -
go. make really simple folks, caffeine work make us
feel alert? timing ingest caffeine play important role
whether not works us us? maybe just start
caffeine work? drink mate coffee, preferred
sources caffeine, feel mental physical lift? - Yeah going suggest
counter people think, drink coffee. - mate, mate okay also? -
[Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form enjoy. - come sort
suggest comes coffee, say dose timing makes
poison. start caffeine works. Caffeine class drugs call
psychoactive stimulants. works variety mechanisms, one
dopamine mechanism dopamine often think reward chemical or,
dopamine also much alerting neurochemical, well. caffeine
role seems play increasing dopamine. principal mode action, believe
terms making alert keeping awake throughout day
effects adenosine. explain adenosine moment
woke morning, chemical adenosine building brain.
longer awake, adenosine accumulates, - mask, may
ask, accumulating neurons glia, blood vessels? also
accumulating body? adenosine coming from?
accumulating? - Yeah, adenosine talking creating
sleep pressure central brain phenomenon. comes neurons


combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

rather states slow wave sleep also resembles waking states.
beautifully illustrated REM sleep can mimic active brain
states achieve waking. sort waking state might
experienced experience daily basis might look similar slow wave sleep, non
REM sleep, any? - genius way thinking turns tables love it.
almost never see anything like true ultra slow waves deep non REM sleep.
spoke two stages non REM REM. Non REM subdivided
four separate stages, stages, one four, increasing depth sleep.
stages three four typically call deep non REM sleep. Stages one
two light non REM. - maybe take arc night just that. put
head down, well, you, time normally go sleep? - usually
sort around 10:30pm guy. usually naturally wake sort little bit
7:00, sometimes 6:45 7:00, alarm set 7:04am. - heard
here, folks Matt Walker use alarm clock. - rarely, rarely usually sort of. -
doesn't recommend it, use it. - Yeah, usually. - human all. -
Oh, human. sleep issues love speak too.
just, know, event that, know, 'cause like keep regularity
too. got keep two things balance. 7:04 just because, know,
not idiosyncratic. don't know always set things hot numbers.
yep you. - go sleep around 10:30, using example,
imagine number people go sleep different times. 10:30
go sleep, 11 me. go sleep 10:30, first, say
three hours sleep, architecture sleep look like compared
last three hours sleep morning? - Yeah, note sort
of, know, 10:30 7:00 just based chronotype preferential
different different people. not suggesting perfect sweet spot
humanity's sleep. just natural sweet spot. - imagine people probably
go sleep somewhere 10pm midnight. - somewhere 9
midnight. - probably wake 5am 7am 5:30 7:30. - Yeah,
yeah least look sort first world nations, typical sleep profile.
first fall asleep, go light stages non REM sleep stages one two

brainwave pattern activity starts slow down. Normally awake, going

00:24:00 Compensating Lost Sleep

- No, no, important. important digression. one question,
saying across night, greater percentage 90 minute cycles
going occupied REM sleep progress night. aware
that, based work done public education efforts others
called circadian forces, forces driving
sleep want sleep, etcetera. Without going details those,
simple question, experiment following. say, God forbid,
prevented going sleep normal time stay four hours
five hours normally predominantly slow wave sleep. - say
finally get lie 3am time normally sleep occupied mostly
rapid eye movement sleep, will experience greater percentage rapid eye
movement sleep called circadian forces, meaning
appropriate time? will system need start beginning race
were, referring it, calling sleep? not clear


anybody, basically, asking is, forced skip slow wave sleep part
night, will system leap rapid eye movement sleep?
start beginning get slow wave sleep first? words, one sleep
state drive entry next sleep state? - Great question, degree
reciprocity sleep states note drive one up,
often not always see change other. pharmacologies
shown independence that. also played around things like
temperature, sometimes can, know, nudge one not seem upset
perturb other. your, think, lovely point, answer is, mix, mostly
latter. Meaning will mostly go REM sleep phases, significantly
deficient deep sleep. just start sleep cycle 3am, rather
10:30pm, doesn't mean brain just says, well, got program, just
going run program, way program runs always start
first couple hours deep sleep. just going begin act number one, scene
one, doesn't that. Now, will get deep sleep begin part
just sleep works. Based long awake, longer
awake, significantly greater pressure deep sleep. actually use
exactly just described experimental technique selectively deprive
people one stages sleep other. will first half night
deprivation, let sleep second half. means will
mostly deep sleep deprived, will still get mostly REM sleep.
switch it, get first four hours, means will mostly get deep
non REM sleep, will get almost no REM sleep. groups,
four hours sleep. difference terms
experimental outcome not sleep time slept
amount. contribution different stages. Now, actually
elegant methods sort selectively going scooping different stages
sleep. way used old school just using timing difference.
- suffers more? lack early phase, lack
later phase night sleep? words, sleep four hours
whatever reason, better off getting early part night's sleep second
half night sleep? - Depends outcome measure is. - gets right
differences slow wave sleep REM. - Right. - probably
misinformed. understanding crude understanding say before. -


much doubt contrary someone like you. - nice you.
first part night slow wave sleep restorative musculature motor
learning, dream content tends less emotional. second half
night, emotional dreams sort unpairing emotional load
previous day experiences. words, deprive myself,
excuse REM, hyper emotional, not maybe not settled kind
experiences life. Whereas deprive slow wave sleep, feel
physical malaise. correct? far simple? simple,
please tell wrong? - No, think much correct. sort
plus. example, deep non REM sleep, get this. almost
form natural blood pressure medication. take away you,
next day, usually going see autonomic dysfunction, usually going see
abnormalities heart rate blood pressure. also know deep non REM
sleep, certain control specific hormones. example, know
insulin regulation sort metabolism, meaning will look regulated
blood sugar perspective versus dysregulated, pre diabetic look profile.
deep sleep seems matter selectively deprive can see. - Growth
hormone. - Growth hormone different actually. beautiful demonstration
growth hormone seems REM sleep dependent. can
come effects alcohol really impressive frightening data
alcohol disruption sleep. also know testosterone, peak levels
testosterone happen REM sleep. - second half night, essentially. -
second half night. really just means the, profile
mental physical dysfunction will different conditions.
one prefer? prefer neither them. really depends
trying optimize for. just complicated, sleep just pluripotent,
know, physiologically systemic, almost impossible not undergo one
two things, just deep sleep deprivation, just REM sleep deprivation, not
show profile really prefer avoid. reason
evolutionary standpoint, preserved stages sleep. mean, sleep just
idiotic, know, evolutionary perspective. - maybe waking idiotic. -
waking is, know, well, yeah. - Based previous idea. - Who've
talking to? think comment specific me. Yeah, normally always
idiot working. think idea sleep, know, profoundly


detrimental us, take face value, know, not finding
mate, not reproducing, not foraging food, not caring
young worst all, vulnerable predation, one grounds
sleep probably selected against. wasn't sleep fought way
heroically every step along evolutionary path. therefore, every sleep
stage also survived best can tell. means non
negotiable. mother nature found way even just sort of, know, thin slice
sleep us, vast, sure evolutionary benefits,
looks though hasn't.

00:32:20 Waking Middle Night

usually favor wisdom 3.6 million years, so. - Yeah, incredible.
want introduce another Gedankenexperiment, thought experiment.
arc night, slow wave sleep predominates early night, REM sleep.
scenario many people including experience regular basis.
go sleep, sleeping just fine, three, four hours it, wake up.
wake up, whatever reason, maybe noise, maybe temperature isn't
right, will certainly talk sleep hygiene, etcetera. get up, go
restroom, might flip lights, might not, get back bed hopefully
not picking phone starting browse wake brain
various mechanisms light cognitive stimulation, etcetera. go back sleep,
say 10, 15 minutes, able fall back asleep. sleep till
typical wake time. detrimental wake episode event terms
longevity, learning, et cetera? love sleep entire night every
night, nights don't. yet, feel pretty good throughout day, days
better others. kind evaluate waking episode, compare
sleeping whole night through, thoughts that? - think
waking sort frequently, describing, probably get
estate order guess within next year, going going
done for, no kidding you. Absolutely kidding you. perfectly natural
normal, particularly progress age, know, children tend typically
continuous sleep. Now not aren't waking brief periods time
fact, do. come end sleep cycle


end REM sleep period 90 minute cycle, almost everybody wakes
make postural movement, turn paralyzed long
body will also like shift weight position. - ever look around? Ever open
eyes look around? - You, sometimes people will open eyes, usually
brief period time usually never commit awakenings
memory. situation situation well, usually now stage life,
don't sleep night. usually bathroom break come back.
perfectly normal. tend forget sleep science, think sleep
efficiency total amount time bed, much percent time
spent asleep? usually look numbers 85%,
healthy sleep efficiency. think going bed spend,
know, say, eight quarter, eight half hours time bed, normal,
healthy sleep efficiency, still may sleeping total seven half hours,
seven three quarter hours. Meaning going awake total, not one
long about, going awake upwards 30 minutes, net time.
Sometimes can 10 minute, know, dalliance gone
bathroom, just gradually drifting back off again. times, will just
couple minutes. don't commit. think need stop,
don't need get worried about, know, periods time awake, just
not sleeping throughout night. love that, too. remember
used happen, still happens occasionally. - Every while,
feels great happen. - lovely thing. - surprise right? Like oh
goodness slept whole night. - now surprise, yeah surprise.
part, think can relaxed
bit attentive, though, spending long periods time, not able get
back sleep. usually define saying, 20, 25 minutes, normally,
time really say okay, explore this, going on?
see happening. thing happening frequently, even
you're, know, not awake 25 minutes stretches, finding waking
consciously aware woken maybe six, seven eight
times throughout night sleep call fragmented great
science sleep past five 10 years yes, quantity important,
quality just important. can't one without terms good
beneficial next day outcome. can't just get four hours sleep, brilliant quality


sleep unimpaired. can get eight hours sleep, poor
quality sleep unimpaired next day. just sort want
asterisk, idea not get worried waking time
awake, perfectly normal natural. happening frequently
throughout night, periods time, long stretches time, upwards 25
minutes, look it. - Well, can assure just helped lot people feel
better waking episode many people experience. - hope
'cause think really important we, know, think desperately guilty
perhaps, know, early puritanical about, know, sleep
retrospected, tried explore case, know, almost
sleep else, dot, dot, dot. time starting write book,
back 2016, know, sleep still neglected stepsister health
conversation today. see the, - certainly changed. -
changing, know, not efforts,
colleagues. - say, well, great give attribution people
involved. course, big field. think done great service cueing
people importance state, not just avoiding troublesome outcomes,
also optimizing waking state. really, know, view sleep period
feels good, not aware feels necessarily.
tremendous benefits well, speak, tremendous
deficits not. think important thing cue people
issue. say mission accomplished, people aware need
sleep. think knowing waking middle night normal,
provided not frequent great will also help people

00:39:48 Uberman (Not Huberman!) Sleep Schedule

may overly concerned that. want use opportunity
raise something called Uberman schedule not confused
Huberman schedule. Fortunately, no one confused yet. years ago,
discussion called Uberman schedule, meaning Superman
schedule. Huberman without H, nothing with. read
Nietzsche will subtext. regardless, Uberman schedule,
understand one person elects sleep 90 minute, bouts spread


throughout day night, attempt get productivity reduce
overall sleep need. paper published recently explored whether not
good bad us. Maybe just give us take home message that. - Yes,
Uberman like schedules lots different forms that, tried
essentially pie chart 24 hour period, short bouts sleep shorter
no, well, slightly longer periods wakefulness, short bouts sleep
wakefulness. know, you're, sort made it, think quip, almost like
sleeping like baby, know, 'cause way babies will sleep. - 90
minute naps. - will have, know, brief naps, awake,
asleep awake. chagrin parents across night,
basically same, awake, asleep, awake, asleep.
schedule types protocols suggested.
really great comprehensive review found not weren't necessarily
helpful, actually really quite detrimental. almost every performance
metric, whether task performance, whether physiological outcome measures,
whether even quality sleep having, trying
get it, downward direction. not surprising look
way physiology programmed, look way circadian
rhythm programmed, none screams us sleeping
way. - Well, chuckling always hear sleep like baby. babies
sleep. say don't sleep like baby, sleep like adult adult, get
solid eight hours. - Billy Crystal's line, was, know, long standing suffering
insomniac, says sleep like baby, awake every 20 minutes. know,
think another one demonstrations fight biology,
normally lose. way know lost disease, sickness impairment.
think sleep, accordance natural biological edict
given, life tends higher quality longer duration.

00:42:48 Viewing Morning SUNLight

- Yeah, agree. Along lines, vision scientists, excited
work non image forming cells eye, called melanopsin cells
inform brain circadian time day. big proponent people getting
sunlight, ideally sunlight, forms bright light eyes early


day want awake. Essentially, phase 24 hour
circadian cycle temperature rising, starting get less light eyes
temperature going terms later day evening.
adjustments general theme like add? way? -
No, think exactly recommend right now. try get least 30
40 minutes exposure kind natural daylight. Now, may parts
world where, know, it's. - rather cloudy part world. -
Liverpool, England, Northwest England not known beach
resorts fine weather. remember sort of, went back home trip first
California, thought, sky low? Just know, constantly
joke UK, usually nine months bad weather three
months Winter. entire year terms climate. come
point, exactly right, try get daylight. Now can know, working
next window getting natural sunlight. natural sunlight even
cloudy day England usually far potent anything get
indoor lighting, despite thinking sort perception wise, maybe much
closer think. - Yeah, sorry interrupt. big
proponent app called Light Meter, will free app, nothing
will allow get pretty decent measurement amount light
energy coming toward you. hold cloudy morning, don't
think bright kind dismal day, notice there'll 1,000, 2,000,
even know, 5,000 Lux, Lux just measure brightness, course.
can point light meter toward indoor light seems bright
intense it'll say 500 Lux realize intensity gauge it,
perceptually not really system receiving. outdoor light key.
get natural stimulation? just say light stimulation early day,
typical, Matt Walker get light stimulation? - no
poster child, usually will, working usually work days.
shopped around found gym huge amounts window exposure facing
East. going sound ridiculous know, Matt Walker chooses gym
basis. - love - solar impact cannot know correct circadian. -
lot criteria selecting gyms, one actually grounded physiology,
biology so. - selfishness sleep. - No great. get
exercise light stimulation simultaneously? - right, yep, yeah. -


stacking cues wakefulness early day. - Exactly, exercise
daylight wonderful cues circadian rhythm alignment, also circadian rhythm
reset day. will use exercise, mean, neither strong morning
type strong evening type. preference exercise probably sometime
middle day, probably somewhere around 1pm sorry, not 1am. usually
working probably around sort seven, sort 45 8am time, usually
start workout. will start cardio spin bike facing window.
luckily, part California, usually sunlight coming through.
doesn't matter just said, even cloudy day Lux
coming light, intensity splendid. prefer favor exercise
just efficiency too, want get also working day, try match
exercise circadian light exposure probably going
really want crush workout, want just, know, make sure good
workout? prefer work out, know, different time. like
daylight. can speak exercise timing point,
lot discussion around that, right time exercise sleep.
can sort bust myths too. think spot suggestion, get
morning daylight, try get exposure, usually least 30 40 minutes,
great work recently coming occupational health domain,
moved workers offices just facing walls know, didn't
exposure natural daylight. time period study
actually front window working. measured sleep
sleep time sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically. forgetting
numbers now think increase total sleep time well 30 minutes.
improvement sleep efficiency five 10%. know, batting
80%, know, sleep efficiency average, bit concerned that. add 10%
now know, great echelon healthy sleepers.
just spend time working front windows. - great probably folks
might want consider spending little less time sunglasses provided can
safely, know, driving, etcetera. not alone exercise behavior
facing East. one Tim Ferriss told recently morning routine
nowadays consists jumping rope facing East get sunlight stimulation
eyes. Matt know, eyes, right? portals
way



00:49:20 Caffeine

convey rest brain body time day wakefulness. Along
lines wakefulness, number questions caffeine. dreaded
beloved caffeine, love caffeine, like relatively restricted periods time.
big fan waking even though wake groggy, allowing natural
wakefulness signals take hold, meaning wake slowly, don't drink
caffeine right away. sort delay caffeine little while, usually 90 minutes two
hours. idea came basis understanding caffeine
adenosine receptor interact. feeling going pronounce adenosine
differently do. - No, no, will that, will go adenosine. - tried go
skeletal instead skeletal synapse synapse. - Schedule schedule. -
go. make really simple folks, caffeine work make us
feel alert? timing ingest caffeine play important role
whether not works us us? maybe just start
caffeine work? drink mate coffee, preferred
sources caffeine, feel mental physical lift? - Yeah going suggest
counter people think, drink coffee. - mate, mate okay also? -
[Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form enjoy. - come sort
suggest comes coffee, say dose timing makes
poison. start caffeine works. Caffeine class drugs call
psychoactive stimulants. works variety mechanisms, one
dopamine mechanism dopamine often think reward chemical or,
dopamine also much alerting neurochemical, well. caffeine
role seems play increasing dopamine. principal mode action, believe
terms making alert keeping awake throughout day
effects adenosine. explain adenosine moment
woke morning, chemical adenosine building brain.
longer awake, adenosine accumulates, - mask, may
ask, accumulating neurons glia, blood vessels? also
accumulating body? adenosine coming from?
accumulating? - Yeah, adenosine talking creating
sleep pressure central brain phenomenon. comes neurons


combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing

regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,

sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal

engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something

suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

suggesting people not not that. Every time taken red eye done two
three days later, get sort general feeling malaise, brain doesn't work
well, think red eyes abolished. pilots mean, the. -

00:24:00 Compensating Lost Sleep

- No, no, important. important digression. one question,
saying across night, greater percentage 90 minute cycles
going occupied REM sleep progress night. aware
that, based work done public education efforts others
called circadian forces, forces driving
sleep want sleep, etcetera. Without going details those,
simple question, experiment following. say, God forbid,
prevented going sleep normal time stay four hours
five hours normally predominantly slow wave sleep. - say
finally get lie 3am time normally sleep occupied mostly
rapid eye movement sleep, will experience greater percentage rapid eye
movement sleep called circadian forces, meaning
appropriate time? will system need start beginning race
were, referring it, calling sleep? not clear


anybody, basically, asking is, forced skip slow wave sleep part
night, will system leap rapid eye movement sleep?
start beginning get slow wave sleep first? words, one sleep
state drive entry next sleep state? - Great question, degree
reciprocity sleep states note drive one up,
often not always see change other. pharmacologies
shown independence that. also played around things like
temperature, sometimes can, know, nudge one not seem upset
perturb other. your, think, lovely point, answer is, mix, mostly
latter. Meaning will mostly go REM sleep phases, significantly
deficient deep sleep. just start sleep cycle 3am, rather
10:30pm, doesn't mean brain just says, well, got program, just
going run program, way program runs always start
first couple hours deep sleep. just going begin act number one, scene
one, doesn't that. Now, will get deep sleep begin part
just sleep works. Based long awake, longer
awake, significantly greater pressure deep sleep. actually use
exactly just described experimental technique selectively deprive
people one stages sleep other. will first half night
deprivation, let sleep second half. means will
mostly deep sleep deprived, will still get mostly REM sleep.
switch it, get first four hours, means will mostly get deep
non REM sleep, will get almost no REM sleep. groups,
four hours sleep. difference terms
experimental outcome not sleep time slept
amount. contribution different stages. Now, actually
elegant methods sort selectively going scooping different stages
sleep. way used old school just using timing difference.
- suffers more? lack early phase, lack
later phase night sleep? words, sleep four hours
whatever reason, better off getting early part night's sleep second
half night sleep? - Depends outcome measure is. - gets right
differences slow wave sleep REM. - Right. - probably
misinformed. understanding crude understanding say before. -


much doubt contrary someone like you. - nice you.
first part night slow wave sleep restorative musculature motor
learning, dream content tends less emotional. second half
night, emotional dreams sort unpairing emotional load
previous day experiences. words, deprive myself,
excuse REM, hyper emotional, not maybe not settled kind
experiences life. Whereas deprive slow wave sleep, feel
physical malaise. correct? far simple? simple,
please tell wrong? - No, think much correct. sort
plus. example, deep non REM sleep, get this. almost
form natural blood pressure medication. take away you,
next day, usually going see autonomic dysfunction, usually going see
abnormalities heart rate blood pressure. also know deep non REM
sleep, certain control specific hormones. example, know
insulin regulation sort metabolism, meaning will look regulated
blood sugar perspective versus dysregulated, pre diabetic look profile.
deep sleep seems matter selectively deprive can see. - Growth
hormone. - Growth hormone different actually. beautiful demonstration
growth hormone seems REM sleep dependent. can
come effects alcohol really impressive frightening data
alcohol disruption sleep. also know testosterone, peak levels
testosterone happen REM sleep. - second half night, essentially. -
second half night. really just means the, profile
mental physical dysfunction will different conditions.
one prefer? prefer neither them. really depends
trying optimize for. just complicated, sleep just pluripotent,
know, physiologically systemic, almost impossible not undergo one
two things, just deep sleep deprivation, just REM sleep deprivation, not
show profile really prefer avoid. reason
evolutionary standpoint, preserved stages sleep. mean, sleep just
idiotic, know, evolutionary perspective. - maybe waking idiotic. -
waking is, know, well, yeah. - Based previous idea. - Who've
talking to? think comment specific me. Yeah, normally always
idiot working. think idea sleep, know, profoundly


detrimental us, take face value, know, not finding
mate, not reproducing, not foraging food, not caring
young worst all, vulnerable predation, one grounds
sleep probably selected against. wasn't sleep fought way
heroically every step along evolutionary path. therefore, every sleep
stage also survived best can tell. means non
negotiable. mother nature found way even just sort of, know, thin slice
sleep us, vast, sure evolutionary benefits,
looks though hasn't.

usually favor wisdom 3.6 million years, so. - Yeah, incredible.
want introduce another Gedankenexperiment, thought experiment.
arc night, slow wave sleep predominates early night, REM sleep.
scenario many people including experience regular basis.
go sleep, sleeping just fine, three, four hours it, wake up.
wake up, whatever reason, maybe noise, maybe temperature isn't
right, will certainly talk sleep hygiene, etcetera. get up, go
restroom, might flip lights, might not, get back bed hopefully
not picking phone starting browse wake brain
various mechanisms light cognitive stimulation, etcetera. go back sleep,
say 10, 15 minutes, able fall back asleep. sleep till
typical wake time. detrimental wake episode event terms
longevity, learning, et cetera? love sleep entire night every
night, nights don't. yet, feel pretty good throughout day, days
better others. kind evaluate waking episode, compare
sleeping whole night through, thoughts that? - think
waking sort frequently, describing, probably get
estate order guess within next year, going going
done for, no kidding you. Absolutely kidding you. perfectly natural
normal, particularly progress age, know, children tend typically
continuous sleep. Now not aren't waking brief periods time
fact, do. come end sleep cycle


end REM sleep period 90 minute cycle, almost everybody wakes
make postural movement, turn paralyzed long
body will also like shift weight position. - ever look around? Ever open
eyes look around? - You, sometimes people will open eyes, usually
brief period time usually never commit awakenings
memory. situation situation well, usually now stage life,
don't sleep night. usually bathroom break come back.
perfectly normal. tend forget sleep science, think sleep
efficiency total amount time bed, much percent time
spent asleep? usually look numbers 85%,
healthy sleep efficiency. think going bed spend,
know, say, eight quarter, eight half hours time bed, normal,
healthy sleep efficiency, still may sleeping total seven half hours,
seven three quarter hours. Meaning going awake total, not one
long about, going awake upwards 30 minutes, net time.
Sometimes can 10 minute, know, dalliance gone
bathroom, just gradually drifting back off again. times, will just
couple minutes. don't commit. think need stop,
don't need get worried about, know, periods time awake, just
not sleeping throughout night. love that, too. remember
used happen, still happens occasionally. - Every while,
feels great happen. - lovely thing. - surprise right? Like oh
goodness slept whole night. - now surprise, yeah surprise.
part, think can relaxed
bit attentive, though, spending long periods time, not able get
back sleep. usually define saying, 20, 25 minutes, normally,
time really say okay, explore this, going on?
see happening. thing happening frequently, even
you're, know, not awake 25 minutes stretches, finding waking
consciously aware woken maybe six, seven eight
times throughout night sleep call fragmented great
science sleep past five 10 years yes, quantity important,
quality just important. can't one without terms good
beneficial next day outcome. can't just get four hours sleep, brilliant quality


sleep unimpaired. can get eight hours sleep, poor
quality sleep unimpaired next day. just sort want
asterisk, idea not get worried waking time
awake, perfectly normal natural. happening frequently
throughout night, periods time, long stretches time, upwards 25
minutes, look it. - Well, can assure just helped lot people feel
better waking episode many people experience. - hope
'cause think really important we, know, think desperately guilty
perhaps, know, early puritanical about, know, sleep
retrospected, tried explore case, know, almost
sleep else, dot, dot, dot. time starting write book,
back 2016, know, sleep still neglected stepsister health
conversation today. see the, - certainly changed. -
changing, know, not efforts,
colleagues. - say, well, great give attribution people
involved. course, big field. think done great service cueing
people importance state, not just avoiding troublesome outcomes,
also optimizing waking state. really, know, view sleep period
feels good, not aware feels necessarily.
tremendous benefits well, speak, tremendous
deficits not. think important thing cue people
issue. say mission accomplished, people aware need
sleep. think knowing waking middle night normal,
provided not frequent great will also help people

00:39:48 Uberman (Not Huberman!) Sleep Schedule

may overly concerned that. want use opportunity
raise something called Uberman schedule not confused
Huberman schedule. Fortunately, no one confused yet. years ago,
discussion called Uberman schedule, meaning Superman
schedule. Huberman without H, nothing with. read
Nietzsche will subtext. regardless, Uberman schedule,
understand one person elects sleep 90 minute, bouts spread


throughout day night, attempt get productivity reduce
overall sleep need. paper published recently explored whether not
good bad us. Maybe just give us take home message that. - Yes,
Uberman like schedules lots different forms that, tried
essentially pie chart 24 hour period, short bouts sleep shorter
no, well, slightly longer periods wakefulness, short bouts sleep
wakefulness. know, you're, sort made it, think quip, almost like
sleeping like baby, know, 'cause way babies will sleep. - 90
minute naps. - will have, know, brief naps, awake,
asleep awake. chagrin parents across night,
basically same, awake, asleep, awake, asleep.
schedule types protocols suggested.
really great comprehensive review found not weren't necessarily
helpful, actually really quite detrimental. almost every performance
metric, whether task performance, whether physiological outcome measures,
whether even quality sleep having, trying
get it, downward direction. not surprising look
way physiology programmed, look way circadian
rhythm programmed, none screams us sleeping
way. - Well, chuckling always hear sleep like baby. babies
sleep. say don't sleep like baby, sleep like adult adult, get
solid eight hours. - Billy Crystal's line, was, know, long standing suffering
insomniac, says sleep like baby, awake every 20 minutes. know,
think another one demonstrations fight biology,
normally lose. way know lost disease, sickness impairment.
think sleep, accordance natural biological edict
given, life tends higher quality longer duration.

00:42:48 Viewing Morning SUNLight

- Yeah, agree. Along lines, vision scientists, excited
work non image forming cells eye, called melanopsin cells
inform brain circadian time day. big proponent people getting
sunlight, ideally sunlight, forms bright light eyes early


day want awake. Essentially, phase 24 hour
circadian cycle temperature rising, starting get less light eyes
temperature going terms later day evening.
adjustments general theme like add? way? -
No, think exactly recommend right now. try get least 30
40 minutes exposure kind natural daylight. Now, may parts
world where, know, it's. - rather cloudy part world. -
Liverpool, England, Northwest England not known beach
resorts fine weather. remember sort of, went back home trip first
California, thought, sky low? Just know, constantly
joke UK, usually nine months bad weather three
months Winter. entire year terms climate. come
point, exactly right, try get daylight. Now can know, working
next window getting natural sunlight. natural sunlight even
cloudy day England usually far potent anything get
indoor lighting, despite thinking sort perception wise, maybe much
closer think. - Yeah, sorry interrupt. big
proponent app called Light Meter, will free app, nothing
will allow get pretty decent measurement amount light
energy coming toward you. hold cloudy morning, don't
think bright kind dismal day, notice there'll 1,000, 2,000,
even know, 5,000 Lux, Lux just measure brightness, course.
can point light meter toward indoor light seems bright
intense it'll say 500 Lux realize intensity gauge it,
perceptually not really system receiving. outdoor light key.
get natural stimulation? just say light stimulation early day,
typical, Matt Walker get light stimulation? - no
poster child, usually will, working usually work days.
shopped around found gym huge amounts window exposure facing
East. going sound ridiculous know, Matt Walker chooses gym
basis. - love - solar impact cannot know correct circadian. -
lot criteria selecting gyms, one actually grounded physiology,
biology so. - selfishness sleep. - No great. get
exercise light stimulation simultaneously? - right, yep, yeah. -


stacking cues wakefulness early day. - Exactly, exercise
daylight wonderful cues circadian rhythm alignment, also circadian rhythm
reset day. will use exercise, mean, neither strong morning
type strong evening type. preference exercise probably sometime
middle day, probably somewhere around 1pm sorry, not 1am. usually
working probably around sort seven, sort 45 8am time, usually
start workout. will start cardio spin bike facing window.
luckily, part California, usually sunlight coming through.
doesn't matter just said, even cloudy day Lux
coming light, intensity splendid. prefer favor exercise
just efficiency too, want get also working day, try match
exercise circadian light exposure probably going
really want crush workout, want just, know, make sure good
workout? prefer work out, know, different time. like
daylight. can speak exercise timing point,
lot discussion around that, right time exercise sleep.
can sort bust myths too. think spot suggestion, get
morning daylight, try get exposure, usually least 30 40 minutes,
great work recently coming occupational health domain,
moved workers offices just facing walls know, didn't
exposure natural daylight. time period study
actually front window working. measured sleep
sleep time sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically. forgetting
numbers now think increase total sleep time well 30 minutes.
improvement sleep efficiency five 10%. know, batting
80%, know, sleep efficiency average, bit concerned that. add 10%
now know, great echelon healthy sleepers.
just spend time working front windows. - great probably folks
might want consider spending little less time sunglasses provided can
safely, know, driving, etcetera. not alone exercise behavior
facing East. one Tim Ferriss told recently morning routine
nowadays consists jumping rope facing East get sunlight stimulation
eyes. Matt know, eyes, right? portals
way



00:49:20 Caffeine

convey rest brain body time day wakefulness. Along
lines wakefulness, number questions caffeine. dreaded
beloved caffeine, love caffeine, like relatively restricted periods time.
big fan waking even though wake groggy, allowing natural
wakefulness signals take hold, meaning wake slowly, don't drink
caffeine right away. sort delay caffeine little while, usually 90 minutes two
hours. idea came basis understanding caffeine
adenosine receptor interact. feeling going pronounce adenosine
differently do. - No, no, will that, will go adenosine. - tried go
skeletal instead skeletal synapse synapse. - Schedule schedule. -
go. make really simple folks, caffeine work make us
feel alert? timing ingest caffeine play important role
whether not works us us? maybe just start
caffeine work? drink mate coffee, preferred
sources caffeine, feel mental physical lift? - Yeah going suggest
counter people think, drink coffee. - mate, mate okay also? -
[Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form enjoy. - come sort
suggest comes coffee, say dose timing makes
poison. start caffeine works. Caffeine class drugs call
psychoactive stimulants. works variety mechanisms, one
dopamine mechanism dopamine often think reward chemical or,
dopamine also much alerting neurochemical, well. caffeine
role seems play increasing dopamine. principal mode action, believe
terms making alert keeping awake throughout day
effects adenosine. explain adenosine moment
woke morning, chemical adenosine building brain.
longer awake, adenosine accumulates, - mask, may
ask, accumulating neurons glia, blood vessels? also
accumulating body? adenosine coming from?
accumulating? - Yeah, adenosine talking creating
sleep pressure central brain phenomenon. comes neurons


combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA

however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water

booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,

least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.

just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

00:24:00 Compensating Lost Sleep

- No, no, important. important digression. one question,
saying across night, greater percentage 90 minute cycles
going occupied REM sleep progress night. aware
that, based work done public education efforts others
called circadian forces, forces driving
sleep want sleep, etcetera. Without going details those,
simple question, experiment following. say, God forbid,
prevented going sleep normal time stay four hours
five hours normally predominantly slow wave sleep. - say
finally get lie 3am time normally sleep occupied mostly
rapid eye movement sleep, will experience greater percentage rapid eye
movement sleep called circadian forces, meaning
appropriate time? will system need start beginning race
were, referring it, calling sleep? not clear


anybody, basically, asking is, forced skip slow wave sleep part
night, will system leap rapid eye movement sleep?
start beginning get slow wave sleep first? words, one sleep
state drive entry next sleep state? - Great question, degree
reciprocity sleep states note drive one up,
often not always see change other. pharmacologies
shown independence that. also played around things like
temperature, sometimes can, know, nudge one not seem upset
perturb other. your, think, lovely point, answer is, mix, mostly
latter. Meaning will mostly go REM sleep phases, significantly
deficient deep sleep. just start sleep cycle 3am, rather
10:30pm, doesn't mean brain just says, well, got program, just
going run program, way program runs always start
first couple hours deep sleep. just going begin act number one, scene
one, doesn't that. Now, will get deep sleep begin part
just sleep works. Based long awake, longer
awake, significantly greater pressure deep sleep. actually use
exactly just described experimental technique selectively deprive
people one stages sleep other. will first half night
deprivation, let sleep second half. means will
mostly deep sleep deprived, will still get mostly REM sleep.
switch it, get first four hours, means will mostly get deep
non REM sleep, will get almost no REM sleep. groups,
four hours sleep. difference terms
experimental outcome not sleep time slept
amount. contribution different stages. Now, actually
elegant methods sort selectively going scooping different stages
sleep. way used old school just using timing difference.
- suffers more? lack early phase, lack
later phase night sleep? words, sleep four hours
whatever reason, better off getting early part night's sleep second
half night sleep? - Depends outcome measure is. - gets right
differences slow wave sleep REM. - Right. - probably
misinformed. understanding crude understanding say before. -


much doubt contrary someone like you. - nice you.
first part night slow wave sleep restorative musculature motor
learning, dream content tends less emotional. second half
night, emotional dreams sort unpairing emotional load
previous day experiences. words, deprive myself,
excuse REM, hyper emotional, not maybe not settled kind
experiences life. Whereas deprive slow wave sleep, feel
physical malaise. correct? far simple? simple,
please tell wrong? - No, think much correct. sort
plus. example, deep non REM sleep, get this. almost
form natural blood pressure medication. take away you,
next day, usually going see autonomic dysfunction, usually going see
abnormalities heart rate blood pressure. also know deep non REM
sleep, certain control specific hormones. example, know
insulin regulation sort metabolism, meaning will look regulated
blood sugar perspective versus dysregulated, pre diabetic look profile.
deep sleep seems matter selectively deprive can see. - Growth
hormone. - Growth hormone different actually. beautiful demonstration
growth hormone seems REM sleep dependent. can
come effects alcohol really impressive frightening data
alcohol disruption sleep. also know testosterone, peak levels
testosterone happen REM sleep. - second half night, essentially. -
second half night. really just means the, profile
mental physical dysfunction will different conditions.
one prefer? prefer neither them. really depends
trying optimize for. just complicated, sleep just pluripotent,
know, physiologically systemic, almost impossible not undergo one
two things, just deep sleep deprivation, just REM sleep deprivation, not
show profile really prefer avoid. reason
evolutionary standpoint, preserved stages sleep. mean, sleep just
idiotic, know, evolutionary perspective. - maybe waking idiotic. -
waking is, know, well, yeah. - Based previous idea. - Who've
talking to? think comment specific me. Yeah, normally always
idiot working. think idea sleep, know, profoundly


detrimental us, take face value, know, not finding
mate, not reproducing, not foraging food, not caring
young worst all, vulnerable predation, one grounds
sleep probably selected against. wasn't sleep fought way
heroically every step along evolutionary path. therefore, every sleep
stage also survived best can tell. means non
negotiable. mother nature found way even just sort of, know, thin slice
sleep us, vast, sure evolutionary benefits,
looks though hasn't.

00:32:20 Waking Middle Night

usually favor wisdom 3.6 million years, so. - Yeah, incredible.
want introduce another Gedankenexperiment, thought experiment.
arc night, slow wave sleep predominates early night, REM sleep.
scenario many people including experience regular basis.
go sleep, sleeping just fine, three, four hours it, wake up.
wake up, whatever reason, maybe noise, maybe temperature isn't
right, will certainly talk sleep hygiene, etcetera. get up, go
restroom, might flip lights, might not, get back bed hopefully
not picking phone starting browse wake brain
various mechanisms light cognitive stimulation, etcetera. go back sleep,
say 10, 15 minutes, able fall back asleep. sleep till
typical wake time. detrimental wake episode event terms
longevity, learning, et cetera? love sleep entire night every
night, nights don't. yet, feel pretty good throughout day, days
better others. kind evaluate waking episode, compare
sleeping whole night through, thoughts that? - think
waking sort frequently, describing, probably get
estate order guess within next year, going going
done for, no kidding you. Absolutely kidding you. perfectly natural
normal, particularly progress age, know, children tend typically
continuous sleep. Now not aren't waking brief periods time
fact, do. come end sleep cycle


end REM sleep period 90 minute cycle, almost everybody wakes
make postural movement, turn paralyzed long
body will also like shift weight position. - ever look around? Ever open
eyes look around? - You, sometimes people will open eyes, usually
brief period time usually never commit awakenings
memory. situation situation well, usually now stage life,
don't sleep night. usually bathroom break come back.
perfectly normal. tend forget sleep science, think sleep
efficiency total amount time bed, much percent time
spent asleep? usually look numbers 85%,
healthy sleep efficiency. think going bed spend,
know, say, eight quarter, eight half hours time bed, normal,
healthy sleep efficiency, still may sleeping total seven half hours,
seven three quarter hours. Meaning going awake total, not one
long about, going awake upwards 30 minutes, net time.
Sometimes can 10 minute, know, dalliance gone
bathroom, just gradually drifting back off again. times, will just
couple minutes. don't commit. think need stop,
don't need get worried about, know, periods time awake, just
not sleeping throughout night. love that, too. remember
used happen, still happens occasionally. - Every while,
feels great happen. - lovely thing. - surprise right? Like oh
goodness slept whole night. - now surprise, yeah surprise.
part, think can relaxed
bit attentive, though, spending long periods time, not able get
back sleep. usually define saying, 20, 25 minutes, normally,
time really say okay, explore this, going on?
see happening. thing happening frequently, even
you're, know, not awake 25 minutes stretches, finding waking
consciously aware woken maybe six, seven eight
times throughout night sleep call fragmented great
science sleep past five 10 years yes, quantity important,
quality just important. can't one without terms good
beneficial next day outcome. can't just get four hours sleep, brilliant quality


sleep unimpaired. can get eight hours sleep, poor
quality sleep unimpaired next day. just sort want
asterisk, idea not get worried waking time
awake, perfectly normal natural. happening frequently
throughout night, periods time, long stretches time, upwards 25
minutes, look it. - Well, can assure just helped lot people feel
better waking episode many people experience. - hope
'cause think really important we, know, think desperately guilty
perhaps, know, early puritanical about, know, sleep
retrospected, tried explore case, know, almost
sleep else, dot, dot, dot. time starting write book,
back 2016, know, sleep still neglected stepsister health
conversation today. see the, - certainly changed. -
changing, know, not efforts,
colleagues. - say, well, great give attribution people
involved. course, big field. think done great service cueing
people importance state, not just avoiding troublesome outcomes,
also optimizing waking state. really, know, view sleep period
feels good, not aware feels necessarily.
tremendous benefits well, speak, tremendous
deficits not. think important thing cue people
issue. say mission accomplished, people aware need
sleep. think knowing waking middle night normal,
provided not frequent great will also help people

00:39:48 Uberman (Not Huberman!) Sleep Schedule

may overly concerned that. want use opportunity
raise something called Uberman schedule not confused
Huberman schedule. Fortunately, no one confused yet. years ago,
discussion called Uberman schedule, meaning Superman
schedule. Huberman without H, nothing with. read
Nietzsche will subtext. regardless, Uberman schedule,
understand one person elects sleep 90 minute, bouts spread


throughout day night, attempt get productivity reduce
overall sleep need. paper published recently explored whether not
good bad us. Maybe just give us take home message that. - Yes,
Uberman like schedules lots different forms that, tried
essentially pie chart 24 hour period, short bouts sleep shorter
no, well, slightly longer periods wakefulness, short bouts sleep
wakefulness. know, you're, sort made it, think quip, almost like
sleeping like baby, know, 'cause way babies will sleep. - 90
minute naps. - will have, know, brief naps, awake,
asleep awake. chagrin parents across night,
basically same, awake, asleep, awake, asleep.
schedule types protocols suggested.
really great comprehensive review found not weren't necessarily
helpful, actually really quite detrimental. almost every performance
metric, whether task performance, whether physiological outcome measures,
whether even quality sleep having, trying
get it, downward direction. not surprising look
way physiology programmed, look way circadian
rhythm programmed, none screams us sleeping
way. - Well, chuckling always hear sleep like baby. babies
sleep. say don't sleep like baby, sleep like adult adult, get
solid eight hours. - Billy Crystal's line, was, know, long standing suffering
insomniac, says sleep like baby, awake every 20 minutes. know,
think another one demonstrations fight biology,
normally lose. way know lost disease, sickness impairment.
think sleep, accordance natural biological edict
given, life tends higher quality longer duration.

00:42:48 Viewing Morning SUNLight

- Yeah, agree. Along lines, vision scientists, excited
work non image forming cells eye, called melanopsin cells
inform brain circadian time day. big proponent people getting
sunlight, ideally sunlight, forms bright light eyes early


day want awake. Essentially, phase 24 hour
circadian cycle temperature rising, starting get less light eyes
temperature going terms later day evening.
adjustments general theme like add? way? -
No, think exactly recommend right now. try get least 30
40 minutes exposure kind natural daylight. Now, may parts
world where, know, it's. - rather cloudy part world. -
Liverpool, England, Northwest England not known beach
resorts fine weather. remember sort of, went back home trip first
California, thought, sky low? Just know, constantly
joke UK, usually nine months bad weather three
months Winter. entire year terms climate. come
point, exactly right, try get daylight. Now can know, working
next window getting natural sunlight. natural sunlight even
cloudy day England usually far potent anything get
indoor lighting, despite thinking sort perception wise, maybe much
closer think. - Yeah, sorry interrupt. big
proponent app called Light Meter, will free app, nothing
will allow get pretty decent measurement amount light
energy coming toward you. hold cloudy morning, don't
think bright kind dismal day, notice there'll 1,000, 2,000,
even know, 5,000 Lux, Lux just measure brightness, course.
can point light meter toward indoor light seems bright
intense it'll say 500 Lux realize intensity gauge it,
perceptually not really system receiving. outdoor light key.
get natural stimulation? just say light stimulation early day,
typical, Matt Walker get light stimulation? - no
poster child, usually will, working usually work days.
shopped around found gym huge amounts window exposure facing
East. going sound ridiculous know, Matt Walker chooses gym
basis. - love - solar impact cannot know correct circadian. -
lot criteria selecting gyms, one actually grounded physiology,
biology so. - selfishness sleep. - No great. get
exercise light stimulation simultaneously? - right, yep, yeah. -


stacking cues wakefulness early day. - Exactly, exercise
daylight wonderful cues circadian rhythm alignment, also circadian rhythm
reset day. will use exercise, mean, neither strong morning
type strong evening type. preference exercise probably sometime
middle day, probably somewhere around 1pm sorry, not 1am. usually
working probably around sort seven, sort 45 8am time, usually
start workout. will start cardio spin bike facing window.
luckily, part California, usually sunlight coming through.
doesn't matter just said, even cloudy day Lux
coming light, intensity splendid. prefer favor exercise
just efficiency too, want get also working day, try match
exercise circadian light exposure probably going
really want crush workout, want just, know, make sure good
workout? prefer work out, know, different time. like
daylight. can speak exercise timing point,
lot discussion around that, right time exercise sleep.
can sort bust myths too. think spot suggestion, get
morning daylight, try get exposure, usually least 30 40 minutes,
great work recently coming occupational health domain,
moved workers offices just facing walls know, didn't
exposure natural daylight. time period study
actually front window working. measured sleep
sleep time sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically. forgetting
numbers now think increase total sleep time well 30 minutes.
improvement sleep efficiency five 10%. know, batting
80%, know, sleep efficiency average, bit concerned that. add 10%
now know, great echelon healthy sleepers.
just spend time working front windows. - great probably folks
might want consider spending little less time sunglasses provided can
safely, know, driving, etcetera. not alone exercise behavior
facing East. one Tim Ferriss told recently morning routine
nowadays consists jumping rope facing East get sunlight stimulation
eyes. Matt know, eyes, right? portals
way



00:49:20 Caffeine

convey rest brain body time day wakefulness. Along
lines wakefulness, number questions caffeine. dreaded
beloved caffeine, love caffeine, like relatively restricted periods time.
big fan waking even though wake groggy, allowing natural
wakefulness signals take hold, meaning wake slowly, don't drink
caffeine right away. sort delay caffeine little while, usually 90 minutes two
hours. idea came basis understanding caffeine
adenosine receptor interact. feeling going pronounce adenosine
differently do. - No, no, will that, will go adenosine. - tried go
skeletal instead skeletal synapse synapse. - Schedule schedule. -
go. make really simple folks, caffeine work make us
feel alert? timing ingest caffeine play important role
whether not works us us? maybe just start
caffeine work? drink mate coffee, preferred
sources caffeine, feel mental physical lift? - Yeah going suggest
counter people think, drink coffee. - mate, mate okay also? -
[Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form enjoy. - come sort
suggest comes coffee, say dose timing makes
poison. start caffeine works. Caffeine class drugs call
psychoactive stimulants. works variety mechanisms, one
dopamine mechanism dopamine often think reward chemical or,
dopamine also much alerting neurochemical, well. caffeine
role seems play increasing dopamine. principal mode action, believe
terms making alert keeping awake throughout day
effects adenosine. explain adenosine moment
woke morning, chemical adenosine building brain.
longer awake, adenosine accumulates, - mask, may
ask, accumulating neurons glia, blood vessels? also
accumulating body? adenosine coming from?
accumulating? - Yeah, adenosine talking creating
sleep pressure central brain phenomenon. comes neurons


combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

anybody, basically, asking is, forced skip slow wave sleep part
night, will system leap rapid eye movement sleep?
start beginning get slow wave sleep first? words, one sleep
state drive entry next sleep state? - Great question, degree
reciprocity sleep states note drive one up,
often not always see change other. pharmacologies
shown independence that. also played around things like
temperature, sometimes can, know, nudge one not seem upset
perturb other. your, think, lovely point, answer is, mix, mostly
latter. Meaning will mostly go REM sleep phases, significantly
deficient deep sleep. just start sleep cycle 3am, rather
10:30pm, doesn't mean brain just says, well, got program, just
going run program, way program runs always start
first couple hours deep sleep. just going begin act number one, scene
one, doesn't that. Now, will get deep sleep begin part
just sleep works. Based long awake, longer
awake, significantly greater pressure deep sleep. actually use
exactly just described experimental technique selectively deprive
people one stages sleep other. will first half night
deprivation, let sleep second half. means will
mostly deep sleep deprived, will still get mostly REM sleep.
switch it, get first four hours, means will mostly get deep
non REM sleep, will get almost no REM sleep. groups,
four hours sleep. difference terms
experimental outcome not sleep time slept
amount. contribution different stages. Now, actually
elegant methods sort selectively going scooping different stages
sleep. way used old school just using timing difference.
- suffers more? lack early phase, lack
later phase night sleep? words, sleep four hours
whatever reason, better off getting early part night's sleep second
half night sleep? - Depends outcome measure is. - gets right
differences slow wave sleep REM. - Right. - probably
misinformed. understanding crude understanding say before. -


much doubt contrary someone like you. - nice you.
first part night slow wave sleep restorative musculature motor
learning, dream content tends less emotional. second half
night, emotional dreams sort unpairing emotional load
previous day experiences. words, deprive myself,
excuse REM, hyper emotional, not maybe not settled kind
experiences life. Whereas deprive slow wave sleep, feel
physical malaise. correct? far simple? simple,
please tell wrong? - No, think much correct. sort
plus. example, deep non REM sleep, get this. almost
form natural blood pressure medication. take away you,
next day, usually going see autonomic dysfunction, usually going see
abnormalities heart rate blood pressure. also know deep non REM
sleep, certain control specific hormones. example, know
insulin regulation sort metabolism, meaning will look regulated
blood sugar perspective versus dysregulated, pre diabetic look profile.
deep sleep seems matter selectively deprive can see. - Growth
hormone. - Growth hormone different actually. beautiful demonstration
growth hormone seems REM sleep dependent. can
come effects alcohol really impressive frightening data
alcohol disruption sleep. also know testosterone, peak levels
testosterone happen REM sleep. - second half night, essentially. -
second half night. really just means the, profile
mental physical dysfunction will different conditions.
one prefer? prefer neither them. really depends
trying optimize for. just complicated, sleep just pluripotent,
know, physiologically systemic, almost impossible not undergo one
two things, just deep sleep deprivation, just REM sleep deprivation, not
show profile really prefer avoid. reason
evolutionary standpoint, preserved stages sleep. mean, sleep just
idiotic, know, evolutionary perspective. - maybe waking idiotic. -
waking is, know, well, yeah. - Based previous idea. - Who've
talking to? think comment specific me. Yeah, normally always
idiot working. think idea sleep, know, profoundly


detrimental us, take face value, know, not finding
mate, not reproducing, not foraging food, not caring
young worst all, vulnerable predation, one grounds
sleep probably selected against. wasn't sleep fought way
heroically every step along evolutionary path. therefore, every sleep
stage also survived best can tell. means non
negotiable. mother nature found way even just sort of, know, thin slice
sleep us, vast, sure evolutionary benefits,
looks though hasn't.

00:32:20 Waking Middle Night

usually favor wisdom 3.6 million years, so. - Yeah, incredible.
want introduce another Gedankenexperiment, thought experiment.
arc night, slow wave sleep predominates early night, REM sleep.
scenario many people including experience regular basis.
go sleep, sleeping just fine, three, four hours it, wake up.
wake up, whatever reason, maybe noise, maybe temperature isn't
right, will certainly talk sleep hygiene, etcetera. get up, go
restroom, might flip lights, might not, get back bed hopefully
not picking phone starting browse wake brain
various mechanisms light cognitive stimulation, etcetera. go back sleep,
say 10, 15 minutes, able fall back asleep. sleep till
typical wake time. detrimental wake episode event terms
longevity, learning, et cetera? love sleep entire night every
night, nights don't. yet, feel pretty good throughout day, days
better others. kind evaluate waking episode, compare
sleeping whole night through, thoughts that? - think
waking sort frequently, describing, probably get
estate order guess within next year, going going
done for, no kidding you. Absolutely kidding you. perfectly natural
normal, particularly progress age, know, children tend typically
continuous sleep. Now not aren't waking brief periods time
fact, do. come end sleep cycle


end REM sleep period 90 minute cycle, almost everybody wakes
make postural movement, turn paralyzed long
body will also like shift weight position. - ever look around? Ever open
eyes look around? - You, sometimes people will open eyes, usually
brief period time usually never commit awakenings
memory. situation situation well, usually now stage life,
don't sleep night. usually bathroom break come back.
perfectly normal. tend forget sleep science, think sleep
efficiency total amount time bed, much percent time
spent asleep? usually look numbers 85%,
healthy sleep efficiency. think going bed spend,
know, say, eight quarter, eight half hours time bed, normal,
healthy sleep efficiency, still may sleeping total seven half hours,
seven three quarter hours. Meaning going awake total, not one
long about, going awake upwards 30 minutes, net time.
Sometimes can 10 minute, know, dalliance gone
bathroom, just gradually drifting back off again. times, will just
couple minutes. don't commit. think need stop,
don't need get worried about, know, periods time awake, just
not sleeping throughout night. love that, too. remember
used happen, still happens occasionally. - Every while,
feels great happen. - lovely thing. - surprise right? Like oh
goodness slept whole night. - now surprise, yeah surprise.
part, think can relaxed
bit attentive, though, spending long periods time, not able get
back sleep. usually define saying, 20, 25 minutes, normally,
time really say okay, explore this, going on?
see happening. thing happening frequently, even
you're, know, not awake 25 minutes stretches, finding waking
consciously aware woken maybe six, seven eight
times throughout night sleep call fragmented great
science sleep past five 10 years yes, quantity important,
quality just important. can't one without terms good
beneficial next day outcome. can't just get four hours sleep, brilliant quality


sleep unimpaired. can get eight hours sleep, poor
quality sleep unimpaired next day. just sort want
asterisk, idea not get worried waking time
awake, perfectly normal natural. happening frequently
throughout night, periods time, long stretches time, upwards 25
minutes, look it. - Well, can assure just helped lot people feel
better waking episode many people experience. - hope
'cause think really important we, know, think desperately guilty
perhaps, know, early puritanical about, know, sleep
retrospected, tried explore case, know, almost
sleep else, dot, dot, dot. time starting write book,
back 2016, know, sleep still neglected stepsister health
conversation today. see the, - certainly changed. -
changing, know, not efforts,
colleagues. - say, well, great give attribution people
involved. course, big field. think done great service cueing
people importance state, not just avoiding troublesome outcomes,
also optimizing waking state. really, know, view sleep period
feels good, not aware feels necessarily.
tremendous benefits well, speak, tremendous
deficits not. think important thing cue people
issue. say mission accomplished, people aware need
sleep. think knowing waking middle night normal,
provided not frequent great will also help people

00:39:48 Uberman (Not Huberman!) Sleep Schedule

may overly concerned that. want use opportunity
raise something called Uberman schedule not confused
Huberman schedule. Fortunately, no one confused yet. years ago,
discussion called Uberman schedule, meaning Superman
schedule. Huberman without H, nothing with. read
Nietzsche will subtext. regardless, Uberman schedule,
understand one person elects sleep 90 minute, bouts spread


throughout day night, attempt get productivity reduce
overall sleep need. paper published recently explored whether not
good bad us. Maybe just give us take home message that. - Yes,
Uberman like schedules lots different forms that, tried
essentially pie chart 24 hour period, short bouts sleep shorter
no, well, slightly longer periods wakefulness, short bouts sleep
wakefulness. know, you're, sort made it, think quip, almost like
sleeping like baby, know, 'cause way babies will sleep. - 90
minute naps. - will have, know, brief naps, awake,
asleep awake. chagrin parents across night,
basically same, awake, asleep, awake, asleep.
schedule types protocols suggested.
really great comprehensive review found not weren't necessarily
helpful, actually really quite detrimental. almost every performance
metric, whether task performance, whether physiological outcome measures,
whether even quality sleep having, trying
get it, downward direction. not surprising look
way physiology programmed, look way circadian
rhythm programmed, none screams us sleeping
way. - Well, chuckling always hear sleep like baby. babies
sleep. say don't sleep like baby, sleep like adult adult, get
solid eight hours. - Billy Crystal's line, was, know, long standing suffering
insomniac, says sleep like baby, awake every 20 minutes. know,
think another one demonstrations fight biology,
normally lose. way know lost disease, sickness impairment.
think sleep, accordance natural biological edict
given, life tends higher quality longer duration.

00:42:48 Viewing Morning SUNLight

- Yeah, agree. Along lines, vision scientists, excited
work non image forming cells eye, called melanopsin cells
inform brain circadian time day. big proponent people getting
sunlight, ideally sunlight, forms bright light eyes early


day want awake. Essentially, phase 24 hour
circadian cycle temperature rising, starting get less light eyes
temperature going terms later day evening.
adjustments general theme like add? way? -
No, think exactly recommend right now. try get least 30
40 minutes exposure kind natural daylight. Now, may parts
world where, know, it's. - rather cloudy part world. -
Liverpool, England, Northwest England not known beach
resorts fine weather. remember sort of, went back home trip first
California, thought, sky low? Just know, constantly
joke UK, usually nine months bad weather three
months Winter. entire year terms climate. come
point, exactly right, try get daylight. Now can know, working
next window getting natural sunlight. natural sunlight even
cloudy day England usually far potent anything get
indoor lighting, despite thinking sort perception wise, maybe much
closer think. - Yeah, sorry interrupt. big
proponent app called Light Meter, will free app, nothing
will allow get pretty decent measurement amount light
energy coming toward you. hold cloudy morning, don't
think bright kind dismal day, notice there'll 1,000, 2,000,
even know, 5,000 Lux, Lux just measure brightness, course.
can point light meter toward indoor light seems bright
intense it'll say 500 Lux realize intensity gauge it,
perceptually not really system receiving. outdoor light key.
get natural stimulation? just say light stimulation early day,
typical, Matt Walker get light stimulation? - no
poster child, usually will, working usually work days.
shopped around found gym huge amounts window exposure facing
East. going sound ridiculous know, Matt Walker chooses gym
basis. - love - solar impact cannot know correct circadian. -
lot criteria selecting gyms, one actually grounded physiology,
biology so. - selfishness sleep. - No great. get
exercise light stimulation simultaneously? - right, yep, yeah. -


stacking cues wakefulness early day. - Exactly, exercise
daylight wonderful cues circadian rhythm alignment, also circadian rhythm
reset day. will use exercise, mean, neither strong morning
type strong evening type. preference exercise probably sometime
middle day, probably somewhere around 1pm sorry, not 1am. usually
working probably around sort seven, sort 45 8am time, usually
start workout. will start cardio spin bike facing window.
luckily, part California, usually sunlight coming through.
doesn't matter just said, even cloudy day Lux
coming light, intensity splendid. prefer favor exercise
just efficiency too, want get also working day, try match
exercise circadian light exposure probably going
really want crush workout, want just, know, make sure good
workout? prefer work out, know, different time. like
daylight. can speak exercise timing point,
lot discussion around that, right time exercise sleep.
can sort bust myths too. think spot suggestion, get
morning daylight, try get exposure, usually least 30 40 minutes,
great work recently coming occupational health domain,
moved workers offices just facing walls know, didn't
exposure natural daylight. time period study
actually front window working. measured sleep
sleep time sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically. forgetting
numbers now think increase total sleep time well 30 minutes.
improvement sleep efficiency five 10%. know, batting
80%, know, sleep efficiency average, bit concerned that. add 10%
now know, great echelon healthy sleepers.
just spend time working front windows. - great probably folks
might want consider spending little less time sunglasses provided can

00:49:20 Caffeine

convey rest brain body time day wakefulness. Along
lines wakefulness, number questions caffeine. dreaded
beloved caffeine, love caffeine, like relatively restricted periods time.
big fan waking even though wake groggy, allowing natural
wakefulness signals take hold, meaning wake slowly, don't drink
caffeine right away. sort delay caffeine little while, usually 90 minutes two
hours. idea came basis understanding caffeine
adenosine receptor interact. feeling going pronounce adenosine
differently do. - No, no, will that, will go adenosine. - tried go
skeletal instead skeletal synapse synapse. - Schedule schedule. -
go. make really simple folks, caffeine work make us
feel alert? timing ingest caffeine play important role
whether not works us us? maybe just start
caffeine work? drink mate coffee, preferred
sources caffeine, feel mental physical lift? - Yeah going suggest
counter people think, drink coffee. - mate, mate okay also? -
[Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form enjoy. - come sort
suggest comes coffee, say dose timing makes
poison. start caffeine works. Caffeine class drugs call
psychoactive stimulants. works variety mechanisms, one
dopamine mechanism dopamine often think reward chemical or,
dopamine also much alerting neurochemical, well. caffeine
role seems play increasing dopamine. principal mode action, believe
terms making alert keeping awake throughout day
effects adenosine. explain adenosine moment
woke morning, chemical adenosine building brain.
longer awake, adenosine accumulates, - mask, may
ask, accumulating neurons glia, blood vessels? also
accumulating body? adenosine coming from?
accumulating? - Yeah, adenosine talking creating
sleep pressure central brain phenomenon. comes neurons


combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

much doubt contrary someone like you. - nice you.
first part night slow wave sleep restorative musculature motor
learning, dream content tends less emotional. second half
night, emotional dreams sort unpairing emotional load
previous day experiences. words, deprive myself,
excuse REM, hyper emotional, not maybe not settled kind
experiences life. Whereas deprive slow wave sleep, feel
physical malaise. correct? far simple? simple,
please tell wrong? - No, think much correct. sort
plus. example, deep non REM sleep, get this. almost
form natural blood pressure medication. take away you,
next day, usually going see autonomic dysfunction, usually going see
abnormalities heart rate blood pressure. also know deep non REM
sleep, certain control specific hormones. example, know
insulin regulation sort metabolism, meaning will look regulated
blood sugar perspective versus dysregulated, pre diabetic look profile.
deep sleep seems matter selectively deprive can see. - Growth
hormone. - Growth hormone different actually. beautiful demonstration
growth hormone seems REM sleep dependent. can
come effects alcohol really impressive frightening data
alcohol disruption sleep. also know testosterone, peak levels
testosterone happen REM sleep. - second half night, essentially. -
second half night. really just means the, profile
mental physical dysfunction will different conditions.
one prefer? prefer neither them. really depends
trying optimize for. just complicated, sleep just pluripotent,
know, physiologically systemic, almost impossible not undergo one
two things, just deep sleep deprivation, just REM sleep deprivation, not
show profile really prefer avoid. reason
evolutionary standpoint, preserved stages sleep. mean, sleep just
idiotic, know, evolutionary perspective. - maybe waking idiotic. -
waking is, know, well, yeah. - Based previous idea. - Who've
talking to? think comment specific me. Yeah, normally always
idiot working. think idea sleep, know, profoundly


detrimental us, take face value, know, not finding
mate, not reproducing, not foraging food, not caring
young worst all, vulnerable predation, one grounds
sleep probably selected against. wasn't sleep fought way
heroically every step along evolutionary path. therefore, every sleep
stage also survived best can tell. means non
negotiable. mother nature found way even just sort of, know, thin slice
sleep us, vast, sure evolutionary benefits,
looks though hasn't.

00:32:20 Waking Middle Night

usually favor wisdom 3.6 million years, so. - Yeah, incredible.
want introduce another Gedankenexperiment, thought experiment.
arc night, slow wave sleep predominates early night, REM sleep.
scenario many people including experience regular basis.
go sleep, sleeping just fine, three, four hours it, wake up.
wake up, whatever reason, maybe noise, maybe temperature isn't
right, will certainly talk sleep hygiene, etcetera. get up, go
restroom, might flip lights, might not, get back bed hopefully
not picking phone starting browse wake brain
various mechanisms light cognitive stimulation, etcetera. go back sleep,
say 10, 15 minutes, able fall back asleep. sleep till
typical wake time. detrimental wake episode event terms
longevity, learning, et cetera? love sleep entire night every
night, nights don't. yet, feel pretty good throughout day, days
better others. kind evaluate waking episode, compare
sleeping whole night through, thoughts that? - think
waking sort frequently, describing, probably get
estate order guess within next year, going going
done for, no kidding you. Absolutely kidding you. perfectly natural
normal, particularly progress age, know, children tend typically
continuous sleep. Now not aren't waking brief periods time
fact, do. come end sleep cycle


end REM sleep period 90 minute cycle, almost everybody wakes
make postural movement, turn paralyzed long
body will also like shift weight position. - ever look around? Ever open
eyes look around? - You, sometimes people will open eyes, usually
brief period time usually never commit awakenings
memory. situation situation well, usually now stage life,
don't sleep night. usually bathroom break come back.
perfectly normal. tend forget sleep science, think sleep
efficiency total amount time bed, much percent time
spent asleep? usually look numbers 85%,
healthy sleep efficiency. think going bed spend,
know, say, eight quarter, eight half hours time bed, normal,
healthy sleep efficiency, still may sleeping total seven half hours,
seven three quarter hours. Meaning going awake total, not one
long about, going awake upwards 30 minutes, net time.
Sometimes can 10 minute, know, dalliance gone
bathroom, just gradually drifting back off again. times, will just
couple minutes. don't commit. think need stop,
don't need get worried about, know, periods time awake, just
not sleeping throughout night. love that, too. remember
used happen, still happens occasionally. - Every while,
feels great happen. - lovely thing. - surprise right? Like oh
goodness slept whole night. - now surprise, yeah surprise.
part, think can relaxed
bit attentive, though, spending long periods time, not able get
back sleep. usually define saying, 20, 25 minutes, normally,
time really say okay, explore this, going on?
see happening. thing happening frequently, even
you're, know, not awake 25 minutes stretches, finding waking
consciously aware woken maybe six, seven eight
times throughout night sleep call fragmented great
science sleep past five 10 years yes, quantity important,
quality just important. can't one without terms good
beneficial next day outcome. can't just get four hours sleep, brilliant quality


sleep unimpaired. can get eight hours sleep, poor
quality sleep unimpaired next day. just sort want
asterisk, idea not get worried waking time
awake, perfectly normal natural. happening frequently
throughout night, periods time, long stretches time, upwards 25
minutes, look it. - Well, can assure just helped lot people feel
better waking episode many people experience. - hope
'cause think really important we, know, think desperately guilty
perhaps, know, early puritanical about, know, sleep
retrospected, tried explore case, know, almost
sleep else, dot, dot, dot. time starting write book,
back 2016, know, sleep still neglected stepsister health
conversation today. see the, - certainly changed. -
changing, know, not efforts,
colleagues. - say, well, great give attribution people
involved. course, big field. think done great service cueing
people importance state, not just avoiding troublesome outcomes,
also optimizing waking state. really, know, view sleep period
feels good, not aware feels necessarily.
tremendous benefits well, speak, tremendous
deficits not. think important thing cue people
issue. say mission accomplished, people aware need
sleep. think knowing waking middle night normal,
provided not frequent great will also help people

00:39:48 Uberman (Not Huberman!) Sleep Schedule

may overly concerned that. want use opportunity
raise something called Uberman schedule not confused
Huberman schedule. Fortunately, no one confused yet. years ago,
discussion called Uberman schedule, meaning Superman
schedule. Huberman without H, nothing with. read
Nietzsche will subtext. regardless, Uberman schedule,
understand one person elects sleep 90 minute, bouts spread


throughout day night, attempt get productivity reduce
overall sleep need. paper published recently explored whether not
good bad us. Maybe just give us take home message that. - Yes,
Uberman like schedules lots different forms that, tried
essentially pie chart 24 hour period, short bouts sleep shorter
no, well, slightly longer periods wakefulness, short bouts sleep
wakefulness. know, you're, sort made it, think quip, almost like
sleeping like baby, know, 'cause way babies will sleep. - 90
minute naps. - will have, know, brief naps, awake,
asleep awake. chagrin parents across night,
basically same, awake, asleep, awake, asleep.
schedule types protocols suggested.
really great comprehensive review found not weren't necessarily
helpful, actually really quite detrimental. almost every performance
metric, whether task performance, whether physiological outcome measures,
whether even quality sleep having, trying
get it, downward direction. not surprising look
way physiology programmed, look way circadian
rhythm programmed, none screams us sleeping
way. - Well, chuckling always hear sleep like baby. babies
sleep. say don't sleep like baby, sleep like adult adult, get
solid eight hours. - Billy Crystal's line, was, know, long standing suffering
insomniac, says sleep like baby, awake every 20 minutes. know,
think another one demonstrations fight biology,
normally lose. way know lost disease, sickness impairment.
think sleep, accordance natural biological edict
given, life tends higher quality longer duration.

00:42:48 Viewing Morning SUNLight

- Yeah, agree. Along lines, vision scientists, excited
work non image forming cells eye, called melanopsin cells
inform brain circadian time day. big proponent people getting
sunlight, ideally sunlight, forms bright light eyes early


day want awake. Essentially, phase 24 hour
circadian cycle temperature rising, starting get less light eyes
temperature going terms later day evening.
adjustments general theme like add? way? -
No, think exactly recommend right now. try get least 30
40 minutes exposure kind natural daylight. Now, may parts
world where, know, it's. - rather cloudy part world. -
Liverpool, England, Northwest England not known beach
resorts fine weather. remember sort of, went back home trip first
California, thought, sky low? Just know, constantly
joke UK, usually nine months bad weather three
months Winter. entire year terms climate. come
point, exactly right, try get daylight. Now can know, working
next window getting natural sunlight. natural sunlight even
cloudy day England usually far potent anything get
indoor lighting, despite thinking sort perception wise, maybe much
closer think. - Yeah, sorry interrupt. big
proponent app called Light Meter, will free app, nothing
will allow get pretty decent measurement amount light
energy coming toward you. hold cloudy morning, don't
think bright kind dismal day, notice there'll 1,000, 2,000,
even know, 5,000 Lux, Lux just measure brightness, course.
can point light meter toward indoor light seems bright
intense it'll say 500 Lux realize intensity gauge it,
perceptually not really system receiving. outdoor light key.
get natural stimulation? just say light stimulation early day,
typical, Matt Walker get light stimulation? - no
poster child, usually will, working usually work days.
shopped around found gym huge amounts window exposure facing
East. going sound ridiculous know, Matt Walker chooses gym
basis. - love - solar impact cannot know correct circadian. -
lot criteria selecting gyms, one actually grounded physiology,
biology so. - selfishness sleep. - No great. get
exercise light stimulation simultaneously? - right, yep, yeah. -


stacking cues wakefulness early day. - Exactly, exercise
daylight wonderful cues circadian rhythm alignment, also circadian rhythm
reset day. will use exercise, mean, neither strong morning
type strong evening type. preference exercise probably sometime
middle day, probably somewhere around 1pm sorry, not 1am. usually
working probably around sort seven, sort 45 8am time, usually
start workout. will start cardio spin bike facing window.
luckily, part California, usually sunlight coming through.
doesn't matter just said, even cloudy day Lux
coming light, intensity splendid. prefer favor exercise
just efficiency too, want get also working day, try match
exercise circadian light exposure probably going
really want crush workout, want just, know, make sure good
workout? prefer work out, know, different time. like
daylight. can speak exercise timing point,
lot discussion around that, right time exercise sleep.
can sort bust myths too. think spot suggestion, get
morning daylight, try get exposure, usually least 30 40 minutes,
great work recently coming occupational health domain,
moved workers offices just facing walls know, didn't
exposure natural daylight. time period study
actually front window working. measured sleep
sleep time sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically. forgetting
numbers now think increase total sleep time well 30 minutes.
improvement sleep efficiency five 10%. know, batting
80%, know, sleep efficiency average, bit concerned that. add 10%
now know, great echelon healthy sleepers.
just spend time working front windows. - great probably folks
might want consider spending little less time sunglasses provided can
safely, know, driving, etcetera. not alone exercise behavior
facing East. one Tim Ferriss told recently morning routine
nowadays consists jumping rope facing East get sunlight stimulation
eyes. Matt know, eyes, right? portals
way



00:49:20 Caffeine

convey rest brain body time day wakefulness. Along
lines wakefulness, number questions caffeine. dreaded
beloved caffeine, love caffeine, like relatively restricted periods time.
big fan waking even though wake groggy, allowing natural
wakefulness signals take hold, meaning wake slowly, don't drink
caffeine right away. sort delay caffeine little while, usually 90 minutes two
hours. idea came basis understanding caffeine
adenosine receptor interact. feeling going pronounce adenosine
differently do. - No, no, will that, will go adenosine. - tried go
skeletal instead skeletal synapse synapse. - Schedule schedule. -
go. make really simple folks, caffeine work make us
feel alert? timing ingest caffeine play important role
whether not works us us? maybe just start
caffeine work? drink mate coffee, preferred
sources caffeine, feel mental physical lift? - Yeah going suggest
counter people think, drink coffee. - mate, mate okay also? -
[Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form enjoy. - come sort
suggest comes coffee, say dose timing makes
poison. start caffeine works. Caffeine class drugs call
psychoactive stimulants. works variety mechanisms, one
dopamine mechanism dopamine often think reward chemical or,
dopamine also much alerting neurochemical, well. caffeine
role seems play increasing dopamine. principal mode action, believe
terms making alert keeping awake throughout day
effects adenosine. explain adenosine moment
woke morning, chemical adenosine building brain.
longer awake, adenosine accumulates, - mask, may
ask, accumulating neurons glia, blood vessels? also
accumulating body? adenosine coming from?
accumulating? - Yeah, adenosine talking creating
sleep pressure central brain phenomenon. comes neurons


combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA

however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,

naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour

naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,

gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got

don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak

detrimental us, take face value, know, not finding
mate, not reproducing, not foraging food, not caring
young worst all, vulnerable predation, one grounds
sleep probably selected against. wasn't sleep fought way
heroically every step along evolutionary path. therefore, every sleep
stage also survived best can tell. means non

sleep us, vast, sure evolutionary benefits,
looks though hasn't.

00:32:20 Waking Middle Night

usually favor wisdom 3.6 million years, so. - Yeah, incredible.
want introduce another Gedankenexperiment, thought experiment.
arc night, slow wave sleep predominates early night, REM sleep.
scenario many people including experience regular basis.
go sleep, sleeping just fine, three, four hours it, wake up.
wake up, whatever reason, maybe noise, maybe temperature isn't
right, will certainly talk sleep hygiene, etcetera. get up, go
restroom, might flip lights, might not, get back bed hopefully
not picking phone starting browse wake brain
various mechanisms light cognitive stimulation, etcetera. go back sleep,
say 10, 15 minutes, able fall back asleep. sleep till
typical wake time. detrimental wake episode event terms
longevity, learning, et cetera? love sleep entire night every
night, nights don't. yet, feel pretty good throughout day, days
better others. kind evaluate waking episode, compare
sleeping whole night through, thoughts that? - think
waking sort frequently, describing, probably get
estate order guess within next year, going going
done for, no kidding you. Absolutely kidding you. perfectly natural
normal, particularly progress age, know, children tend typically
continuous sleep. Now not aren't waking brief periods time
fact, do. come end sleep cycle


end REM sleep period 90 minute cycle, almost everybody wakes
make postural movement, turn paralyzed long
body will also like shift weight position. - ever look around? Ever open
eyes look around? - You, sometimes people will open eyes, usually
brief period time usually never commit awakenings
memory. situation situation well, usually now stage life,
don't sleep night. usually bathroom break come back.
perfectly normal. tend forget sleep science, think sleep
efficiency total amount time bed, much percent time
spent asleep? usually look numbers 85%,
healthy sleep efficiency. think going bed spend,
know, say, eight quarter, eight half hours time bed, normal,
healthy sleep efficiency, still may sleeping total seven half hours,
seven three quarter hours. Meaning going awake total, not one
long about, going awake upwards 30 minutes, net time.
Sometimes can 10 minute, know, dalliance gone
bathroom, just gradually drifting back off again. times, will just
couple minutes. don't commit. think need stop,
don't need get worried about, know, periods time awake, just
not sleeping throughout night. love that, too. remember
used happen, still happens occasionally. - Every while,
feels great happen. - lovely thing. - surprise right? Like oh
goodness slept whole night. - now surprise, yeah surprise.
part, think can relaxed
bit attentive, though, spending long periods time, not able get
back sleep. usually define saying, 20, 25 minutes, normally,
time really say okay, explore this, going on?
see happening. thing happening frequently, even
you're, know, not awake 25 minutes stretches, finding waking
consciously aware woken maybe six, seven eight
times throughout night sleep call fragmented great
science sleep past five 10 years yes, quantity important,
quality just important. can't one without terms good
beneficial next day outcome. can't just get four hours sleep, brilliant quality


sleep unimpaired. can get eight hours sleep, poor
quality sleep unimpaired next day. just sort want
asterisk, idea not get worried waking time
awake, perfectly normal natural. happening frequently
throughout night, periods time, long stretches time, upwards 25
minutes, look it. - Well, can assure just helped lot people feel
better waking episode many people experience. - hope
'cause think really important we, know, think desperately guilty
perhaps, know, early puritanical about, know, sleep
retrospected, tried explore case, know, almost
sleep else, dot, dot, dot. time starting write book,
back 2016, know, sleep still neglected stepsister health
conversation today. see the, - certainly changed. -
changing, know, not efforts,
colleagues. - say, well, great give attribution people
involved. course, big field. think done great service cueing
people importance state, not just avoiding troublesome outcomes,
also optimizing waking state. really, know, view sleep period
feels good, not aware feels necessarily.
tremendous benefits well, speak, tremendous
deficits not. think important thing cue people
issue. say mission accomplished, people aware need
sleep. think knowing waking middle night normal,
provided not frequent great will also help people

00:39:48 Uberman (Not Huberman!) Sleep Schedule

may overly concerned that. want use opportunity
raise something called Uberman schedule not confused
Huberman schedule. Fortunately, no one confused yet. years ago,
discussion called Uberman schedule, meaning Superman
schedule. Huberman without H, nothing with. read
Nietzsche will subtext. regardless, Uberman schedule,
understand one person elects sleep 90 minute, bouts spread


throughout day night, attempt get productivity reduce
overall sleep need. paper published recently explored whether not
good bad us. Maybe just give us take home message that. - Yes,
Uberman like schedules lots different forms that, tried
essentially pie chart 24 hour period, short bouts sleep shorter
no, well, slightly longer periods wakefulness, short bouts sleep
wakefulness. know, you're, sort made it, think quip, almost like
sleeping like baby, know, 'cause way babies will sleep. - 90
minute naps. - will have, know, brief naps, awake,
asleep awake. chagrin parents across night,
basically same, awake, asleep, awake, asleep.
schedule types protocols suggested.
really great comprehensive review found not weren't necessarily
helpful, actually really quite detrimental. almost every performance
metric, whether task performance, whether physiological outcome measures,
whether even quality sleep having, trying
get it, downward direction. not surprising look
way physiology programmed, look way circadian
rhythm programmed, none screams us sleeping
way. - Well, chuckling always hear sleep like baby. babies
sleep. say don't sleep like baby, sleep like adult adult, get
solid eight hours. - Billy Crystal's line, was, know, long standing suffering
insomniac, says sleep like baby, awake every 20 minutes. know,
think another one demonstrations fight biology,
normally lose. way know lost disease, sickness impairment.
think sleep, accordance natural biological edict
given, life tends higher quality longer duration.

00:42:48 Viewing Morning SUNLight

- Yeah, agree. Along lines, vision scientists, excited
work non image forming cells eye, called melanopsin cells
inform brain circadian time day. big proponent people getting
sunlight, ideally sunlight, forms bright light eyes early


day want awake. Essentially, phase 24 hour
circadian cycle temperature rising, starting get less light eyes
temperature going terms later day evening.
adjustments general theme like add? way? -
No, think exactly recommend right now. try get least 30
40 minutes exposure kind natural daylight. Now, may parts
world where, know, it's. - rather cloudy part world. -
Liverpool, England, Northwest England not known beach
resorts fine weather. remember sort of, went back home trip first
California, thought, sky low? Just know, constantly
joke UK, usually nine months bad weather three
months Winter. entire year terms climate. come
point, exactly right, try get daylight. Now can know, working
next window getting natural sunlight. natural sunlight even
cloudy day England usually far potent anything get
indoor lighting, despite thinking sort perception wise, maybe much
closer think. - Yeah, sorry interrupt. big
proponent app called Light Meter, will free app, nothing
will allow get pretty decent measurement amount light
energy coming toward you. hold cloudy morning, don't
think bright kind dismal day, notice there'll 1,000, 2,000,
even know, 5,000 Lux, Lux just measure brightness, course.
can point light meter toward indoor light seems bright
intense it'll say 500 Lux realize intensity gauge it,
perceptually not really system receiving. outdoor light key.
get natural stimulation? just say light stimulation early day,
typical, Matt Walker get light stimulation? - no
poster child, usually will, working usually work days.
shopped around found gym huge amounts window exposure facing
East. going sound ridiculous know, Matt Walker chooses gym
basis. - love - solar impact cannot know correct circadian. -
lot criteria selecting gyms, one actually grounded physiology,
biology so. - selfishness sleep. - No great. get
exercise light stimulation simultaneously? - right, yep, yeah. -


stacking cues wakefulness early day. - Exactly, exercise
daylight wonderful cues circadian rhythm alignment, also circadian rhythm
reset day. will use exercise, mean, neither strong morning
type strong evening type. preference exercise probably sometime
middle day, probably somewhere around 1pm sorry, not 1am. usually
working probably around sort seven, sort 45 8am time, usually
start workout. will start cardio spin bike facing window.
luckily, part California, usually sunlight coming through.
doesn't matter just said, even cloudy day Lux
coming light, intensity splendid. prefer favor exercise
just efficiency too, want get also working day, try match
exercise circadian light exposure probably going
really want crush workout, want just, know, make sure good
workout? prefer work out, know, different time. like
daylight. can speak exercise timing point,
lot discussion around that, right time exercise sleep.
can sort bust myths too. think spot suggestion, get
morning daylight, try get exposure, usually least 30 40 minutes,
great work recently coming occupational health domain,
moved workers offices just facing walls know, didn't
exposure natural daylight. time period study
actually front window working. measured sleep
sleep time sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically. forgetting
numbers now think increase total sleep time well 30 minutes.
improvement sleep efficiency five 10%. know, batting
80%, know, sleep efficiency average, bit concerned that. add 10%
now know, great echelon healthy sleepers.
just spend time working front windows. - great probably folks
might want consider spending little less time sunglasses provided can
safely, know, driving, etcetera. not alone exercise behavior
facing East. one Tim Ferriss told recently morning routine
nowadays consists jumping rope facing East get sunlight stimulation
eyes. Matt know, eyes, right? portals
way



00:49:20 Caffeine

convey rest brain body time day wakefulness. Along
lines wakefulness, number questions caffeine. dreaded
beloved caffeine, love caffeine, like relatively restricted periods time.
big fan waking even though wake groggy, allowing natural
wakefulness signals take hold, meaning wake slowly, don't drink
caffeine right away. sort delay caffeine little while, usually 90 minutes two
hours. idea came basis understanding caffeine
adenosine receptor interact. feeling going pronounce adenosine
differently do. - No, no, will that, will go adenosine. - tried go
skeletal instead skeletal synapse synapse. - Schedule schedule. -
go. make really simple folks, caffeine work make us
feel alert? timing ingest caffeine play important role
whether not works us us? maybe just start
caffeine work? drink mate coffee, preferred
sources caffeine, feel mental physical lift? - Yeah going suggest
counter people think, drink coffee. - mate, mate okay also? -
[Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form enjoy. - come sort
suggest comes coffee, say dose timing makes
poison. start caffeine works. Caffeine class drugs call
psychoactive stimulants. works variety mechanisms, one
dopamine mechanism dopamine often think reward chemical or,
dopamine also much alerting neurochemical, well. caffeine
role seems play increasing dopamine. principal mode action, believe
terms making alert keeping awake throughout day
effects adenosine. explain adenosine moment
woke morning, chemical adenosine building brain.
longer awake, adenosine accumulates, - mask, may
ask, accumulating neurons glia, blood vessels? also
accumulating body? adenosine coming from?
accumulating? - Yeah, adenosine talking creating
sleep pressure central brain phenomenon. comes neurons


combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make

hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA

naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.

however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way

hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,

not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one

end REM sleep period 90 minute cycle, almost everybody wakes
make postural movement, turn paralyzed long
body will also like shift weight position. - ever look around? Ever open
eyes look around? - You, sometimes people will open eyes, usually
brief period time usually never commit awakenings
memory. situation situation well, usually now stage life,
don't sleep night. usually bathroom break come back.
perfectly normal. tend forget sleep science, think sleep
efficiency total amount time bed, much percent time
spent asleep? usually look numbers 85%,
healthy sleep efficiency. think going bed spend,
know, say, eight quarter, eight half hours time bed, normal,
healthy sleep efficiency, still may sleeping total seven half hours,
seven three quarter hours. Meaning going awake total, not one
long about, going awake upwards 30 minutes, net time.
Sometimes can 10 minute, know, dalliance gone
bathroom, just gradually drifting back off again. times, will just
couple minutes. don't commit. think need stop,
don't need get worried about, know, periods time awake, just
not sleeping throughout night. love that, too. remember
used happen, still happens occasionally. - Every while,
feels great happen. - lovely thing. - surprise right? Like oh
goodness slept whole night. - now surprise, yeah surprise.
part, think can relaxed
bit attentive, though, spending long periods time, not able get
back sleep. usually define saying, 20, 25 minutes, normally,
time really say okay, explore this, going on?
see happening. thing happening frequently, even
you're, know, not awake 25 minutes stretches, finding waking
consciously aware woken maybe six, seven eight
times throughout night sleep call fragmented great
science sleep past five 10 years yes, quantity important,
quality just important. can't one without terms good
beneficial next day outcome. can't just get four hours sleep, brilliant quality


sleep unimpaired. can get eight hours sleep, poor
quality sleep unimpaired next day. just sort want
asterisk, idea not get worried waking time
awake, perfectly normal natural. happening frequently
throughout night, periods time, long stretches time, upwards 25
minutes, look it. - Well, can assure just helped lot people feel
better waking episode many people experience. - hope
'cause think really important we, know, think desperately guilty
perhaps, know, early puritanical about, know, sleep
retrospected, tried explore case, know, almost
sleep else, dot, dot, dot. time starting write book,
back 2016, know, sleep still neglected stepsister health

people importance state, not just avoiding troublesome outcomes,
also optimizing waking state. really, know, view sleep period

tremendous benefits well, speak, tremendous

00:39:48 Uberman (Not Huberman!) Sleep Schedule

may overly concerned that. want use opportunity
raise something called Uberman schedule not confused
Huberman schedule. Fortunately, no one confused yet. years ago,
discussion called Uberman schedule, meaning Superman
schedule. Huberman without H, nothing with. read
Nietzsche will subtext. regardless, Uberman schedule,
understand one person elects sleep 90 minute, bouts spread


throughout day night, attempt get productivity reduce
overall sleep need. paper published recently explored whether not
good bad us. Maybe just give us take home message that. - Yes,
Uberman like schedules lots different forms that, tried
essentially pie chart 24 hour period, short bouts sleep shorter
no, well, slightly longer periods wakefulness, short bouts sleep
wakefulness. know, you're, sort made it, think quip, almost like
sleeping like baby, know, 'cause way babies will sleep. - 90
minute naps. - will have, know, brief naps, awake,
asleep awake. chagrin parents across night,
basically same, awake, asleep, awake, asleep.
schedule types protocols suggested.
really great comprehensive review found not weren't necessarily
helpful, actually really quite detrimental. almost every performance
metric, whether task performance, whether physiological outcome measures,
whether even quality sleep having, trying
get it, downward direction. not surprising look
way physiology programmed, look way circadian
rhythm programmed, none screams us sleeping
way. - Well, chuckling always hear sleep like baby. babies
sleep. say don't sleep like baby, sleep like adult adult, get
solid eight hours. - Billy Crystal's line, was, know, long standing suffering
insomniac, says sleep like baby, awake every 20 minutes. know,
think another one demonstrations fight biology,
normally lose. way know lost disease, sickness impairment.
think sleep, accordance natural biological edict
given, life tends higher quality longer duration.

00:42:48 Viewing Morning SUNLight

- Yeah, agree. Along lines, vision scientists, excited
work non image forming cells eye, called melanopsin cells
inform brain circadian time day. big proponent people getting
sunlight, ideally sunlight, forms bright light eyes early


day want awake. Essentially, phase 24 hour
circadian cycle temperature rising, starting get less light eyes
temperature going terms later day evening.
adjustments general theme like add? way? -
No, think exactly recommend right now. try get least 30
40 minutes exposure kind natural daylight. Now, may parts
world where, know, it's. - rather cloudy part world. -
Liverpool, England, Northwest England not known beach
resorts fine weather. remember sort of, went back home trip first
California, thought, sky low? Just know, constantly
joke UK, usually nine months bad weather three
months Winter. entire year terms climate. come
point, exactly right, try get daylight. Now can know, working
next window getting natural sunlight. natural sunlight even
cloudy day England usually far potent anything get
indoor lighting, despite thinking sort perception wise, maybe much
closer think. - Yeah, sorry interrupt. big
proponent app called Light Meter, will free app, nothing
will allow get pretty decent measurement amount light
energy coming toward you. hold cloudy morning, don't
think bright kind dismal day, notice there'll 1,000, 2,000,
even know, 5,000 Lux, Lux just measure brightness, course.
can point light meter toward indoor light seems bright
intense it'll say 500 Lux realize intensity gauge it,
perceptually not really system receiving. outdoor light key.
get natural stimulation? just say light stimulation early day,
typical, Matt Walker get light stimulation? - no
poster child, usually will, working usually work days.
shopped around found gym huge amounts window exposure facing
East. going sound ridiculous know, Matt Walker chooses gym
basis. - love - solar impact cannot know correct circadian. -
lot criteria selecting gyms, one actually grounded physiology,
biology so. - selfishness sleep. - No great. get
exercise light stimulation simultaneously? - right, yep, yeah. -


stacking cues wakefulness early day. - Exactly, exercise
daylight wonderful cues circadian rhythm alignment, also circadian rhythm
reset day. will use exercise, mean, neither strong morning
type strong evening type. preference exercise probably sometime
middle day, probably somewhere around 1pm sorry, not 1am. usually
working probably around sort seven, sort 45 8am time, usually
start workout. will start cardio spin bike facing window.
luckily, part California, usually sunlight coming through.
doesn't matter just said, even cloudy day Lux
coming light, intensity splendid. prefer favor exercise
just efficiency too, want get also working day, try match
exercise circadian light exposure probably going
really want crush workout, want just, know, make sure good
workout? prefer work out, know, different time. like
daylight. can speak exercise timing point,
lot discussion around that, right time exercise sleep.
can sort bust myths too. think spot suggestion, get
morning daylight, try get exposure, usually least 30 40 minutes,
great work recently coming occupational health domain,
moved workers offices just facing walls know, didn't
exposure natural daylight. time period study
actually front window working. measured sleep
sleep time sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically. forgetting
numbers now think increase total sleep time well 30 minutes.
improvement sleep efficiency five 10%. know, batting
80%, know, sleep efficiency average, bit concerned that. add 10%
now know, great echelon healthy sleepers.
just spend time working front windows. - great probably folks
might want consider spending little less time sunglasses provided can
safely, know, driving, etcetera. not alone exercise behavior
facing East. one Tim Ferriss told recently morning routine
nowadays consists jumping rope facing East get sunlight stimulation
eyes. Matt know, eyes, right? portals
way



00:49:20 Caffeine

convey rest brain body time day wakefulness. Along
lines wakefulness, number questions caffeine. dreaded
beloved caffeine, love caffeine, like relatively restricted periods time.
big fan waking even though wake groggy, allowing natural
wakefulness signals take hold, meaning wake slowly, don't drink
caffeine right away. sort delay caffeine little while, usually 90 minutes two
hours. idea came basis understanding caffeine
adenosine receptor interact. feeling going pronounce adenosine
differently do. - No, no, will that, will go adenosine. - tried go
skeletal instead skeletal synapse synapse. - Schedule schedule. -
go. make really simple folks, caffeine work make us
feel alert? timing ingest caffeine play important role
whether not works us us? maybe just start
caffeine work? drink mate coffee, preferred
sources caffeine, feel mental physical lift? - Yeah going suggest
counter people think, drink coffee. - mate, mate okay also? -
[Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form enjoy. - come sort
suggest comes coffee, say dose timing makes
poison. start caffeine works. Caffeine class drugs call
psychoactive stimulants. works variety mechanisms, one
dopamine mechanism dopamine often think reward chemical or,
dopamine also much alerting neurochemical, well. caffeine
role seems play increasing dopamine. principal mode action, believe
terms making alert keeping awake throughout day
effects adenosine. explain adenosine moment
woke morning, chemical adenosine building brain.
longer awake, adenosine accumulates, - mask, may
ask, accumulating neurons glia, blood vessels? also
accumulating body? adenosine coming from?
accumulating? - Yeah, adenosine talking creating
sleep pressure central brain phenomenon. comes neurons


combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering

levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA

naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff

however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.

reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen

nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,

least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.

just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -

suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,

don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime

mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.

00:39:48 Uberman (Not Huberman!) Sleep Schedule

may overly concerned that. want use opportunity
raise something called Uberman schedule not confused
Huberman schedule. Fortunately, no one confused yet. years ago,
discussion called Uberman schedule, meaning Superman
schedule. Huberman without H, nothing with. read
Nietzsche will subtext. regardless, Uberman schedule,
understand one person elects sleep 90 minute, bouts spread


throughout day night, attempt get productivity reduce
overall sleep need. paper published recently explored whether not
good bad us. Maybe just give us take home message that. - Yes,
Uberman like schedules lots different forms that, tried
essentially pie chart 24 hour period, short bouts sleep shorter
no, well, slightly longer periods wakefulness, short bouts sleep
wakefulness. know, you're, sort made it, think quip, almost like
sleeping like baby, know, 'cause way babies will sleep. - 90
minute naps. - will have, know, brief naps, awake,
asleep awake. chagrin parents across night,
basically same, awake, asleep, awake, asleep.
schedule types protocols suggested.
really great comprehensive review found not weren't necessarily
helpful, actually really quite detrimental. almost every performance
metric, whether task performance, whether physiological outcome measures,
whether even quality sleep having, trying
get it, downward direction. not surprising look
way physiology programmed, look way circadian
rhythm programmed, none screams us sleeping
way. - Well, chuckling always hear sleep like baby. babies
sleep. say don't sleep like baby, sleep like adult adult, get
solid eight hours. - Billy Crystal's line, was, know, long standing suffering
insomniac, says sleep like baby, awake every 20 minutes. know,
think another one demonstrations fight biology,
normally lose. way know lost disease, sickness impairment.
think sleep, accordance natural biological edict
given, life tends higher quality longer duration.

00:42:48 Viewing Morning SUNLight

- Yeah, agree. Along lines, vision scientists, excited
work non image forming cells eye, called melanopsin cells
inform brain circadian time day. big proponent people getting
sunlight, ideally sunlight, forms bright light eyes early


day want awake. Essentially, phase 24 hour
circadian cycle temperature rising, starting get less light eyes
temperature going terms later day evening.
adjustments general theme like add? way? -
No, think exactly recommend right now. try get least 30
40 minutes exposure kind natural daylight. Now, may parts
world where, know, it's. - rather cloudy part world. -
Liverpool, England, Northwest England not known beach
resorts fine weather. remember sort of, went back home trip first
California, thought, sky low? Just know, constantly
joke UK, usually nine months bad weather three
months Winter. entire year terms climate. come
point, exactly right, try get daylight. Now can know, working
next window getting natural sunlight. natural sunlight even
cloudy day England usually far potent anything get
indoor lighting, despite thinking sort perception wise, maybe much
closer think. - Yeah, sorry interrupt. big
proponent app called Light Meter, will free app, nothing
will allow get pretty decent measurement amount light
energy coming toward you. hold cloudy morning, don't
think bright kind dismal day, notice there'll 1,000, 2,000,
even know, 5,000 Lux, Lux just measure brightness, course.
can point light meter toward indoor light seems bright
intense it'll say 500 Lux realize intensity gauge it,
perceptually not really system receiving. outdoor light key.
get natural stimulation? just say light stimulation early day,
typical, Matt Walker get light stimulation? - no
poster child, usually will, working usually work days.
shopped around found gym huge amounts window exposure facing
East. going sound ridiculous know, Matt Walker chooses gym
basis. - love - solar impact cannot know correct circadian. -
lot criteria selecting gyms, one actually grounded physiology,
biology so. - selfishness sleep. - No great. get
exercise light stimulation simultaneously? - right, yep, yeah. -


stacking cues wakefulness early day. - Exactly, exercise
daylight wonderful cues circadian rhythm alignment, also circadian rhythm
reset day. will use exercise, mean, neither strong morning
type strong evening type. preference exercise probably sometime
middle day, probably somewhere around 1pm sorry, not 1am. usually
working probably around sort seven, sort 45 8am time, usually
start workout. will start cardio spin bike facing window.
luckily, part California, usually sunlight coming through.
doesn't matter just said, even cloudy day Lux
coming light, intensity splendid. prefer favor exercise
just efficiency too, want get also working day, try match
exercise circadian light exposure probably going
really want crush workout, want just, know, make sure good
workout? prefer work out, know, different time. like
daylight. can speak exercise timing point,
lot discussion around that, right time exercise sleep.
can sort bust myths too. think spot suggestion, get
morning daylight, try get exposure, usually least 30 40 minutes,
great work recently coming occupational health domain,
moved workers offices just facing walls know, didn't
exposure natural daylight. time period study
actually front window working. measured sleep
sleep time sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically. forgetting
numbers now think increase total sleep time well 30 minutes.
improvement sleep efficiency five 10%. know, batting
80%, know, sleep efficiency average, bit concerned that. add 10%
now know, great echelon healthy sleepers.
just spend time working front windows. - great probably folks
might want consider spending little less time sunglasses provided can
safely, know, driving, etcetera. not alone exercise behavior
facing East. one Tim Ferriss told recently morning routine
nowadays consists jumping rope facing East get sunlight stimulation
eyes. Matt know, eyes, right? portals
way



00:49:20 Caffeine

convey rest brain body time day wakefulness. Along
lines wakefulness, number questions caffeine. dreaded
beloved caffeine, love caffeine, like relatively restricted periods time.
big fan waking even though wake groggy, allowing natural
wakefulness signals take hold, meaning wake slowly, don't drink
caffeine right away. sort delay caffeine little while, usually 90 minutes two
hours. idea came basis understanding caffeine
adenosine receptor interact. feeling going pronounce adenosine
differently do. - No, no, will that, will go adenosine. - tried go
skeletal instead skeletal synapse synapse. - Schedule schedule. -
go. make really simple folks, caffeine work make us
feel alert? timing ingest caffeine play important role
whether not works us us? maybe just start
caffeine work? drink mate coffee, preferred
sources caffeine, feel mental physical lift? - Yeah going suggest
counter people think, drink coffee. - mate, mate okay also? -
[Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form enjoy. - come sort
suggest comes coffee, say dose timing makes
poison. start caffeine works. Caffeine class drugs call
psychoactive stimulants. works variety mechanisms, one
dopamine mechanism dopamine often think reward chemical or,
dopamine also much alerting neurochemical, well. caffeine
role seems play increasing dopamine. principal mode action, believe
terms making alert keeping awake throughout day
effects adenosine. explain adenosine moment
woke morning, chemical adenosine building brain.
longer awake, adenosine accumulates, - mask, may
ask, accumulating neurons glia, blood vessels? also
accumulating body? adenosine coming from?
accumulating? - Yeah, adenosine talking creating
sleep pressure central brain phenomenon. comes neurons


combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA

however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,

naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.

reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way

naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,

describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

02:59:10 Connecting & Learning Dr. Walker

several which, not going incorporate. Matt,

throughout day night, attempt get productivity reduce
overall sleep need. paper published recently explored whether not
good bad us. Maybe just give us take home message that. - Yes,
Uberman like schedules lots different forms that, tried
essentially pie chart 24 hour period, short bouts sleep shorter
no, well, slightly longer periods wakefulness, short bouts sleep
wakefulness. know, you're, sort made it, think quip, almost like
sleeping like baby, know, 'cause way babies will sleep. - 90
minute naps. - will have, know, brief naps, awake,
asleep awake. chagrin parents across night,
basically same, awake, asleep, awake, asleep.
schedule types protocols suggested.
really great comprehensive review found not weren't necessarily
helpful, actually really quite detrimental. almost every performance
metric, whether task performance, whether physiological outcome measures,
whether even quality sleep having, trying
get it, downward direction. not surprising look
way physiology programmed, look way circadian
rhythm programmed, none screams us sleeping
way. - Well, chuckling always hear sleep like baby. babies
sleep. say don't sleep like baby, sleep like adult adult, get
solid eight hours. - Billy Crystal's line, was, know, long standing suffering
insomniac, says sleep like baby, awake every 20 minutes. know,
think another one demonstrations fight biology,
normally lose. way know lost disease, sickness impairment.
think sleep, accordance natural biological edict
given, life tends higher quality longer duration.

00:42:48 Viewing Morning SUNLight

- Yeah, agree. Along lines, vision scientists, excited
work non image forming cells eye, called melanopsin cells
inform brain circadian time day. big proponent people getting
sunlight, ideally sunlight, forms bright light eyes early


day want awake. Essentially, phase 24 hour
circadian cycle temperature rising, starting get less light eyes
temperature going terms later day evening.
adjustments general theme like add? way? -
No, think exactly recommend right now. try get least 30
40 minutes exposure kind natural daylight. Now, may parts
world where, know, it's. - rather cloudy part world. -
Liverpool, England, Northwest England not known beach
resorts fine weather. remember sort of, went back home trip first
California, thought, sky low? Just know, constantly
joke UK, usually nine months bad weather three
months Winter. entire year terms climate. come
point, exactly right, try get daylight. Now can know, working
next window getting natural sunlight. natural sunlight even
cloudy day England usually far potent anything get
indoor lighting, despite thinking sort perception wise, maybe much
closer think. - Yeah, sorry interrupt. big
proponent app called Light Meter, will free app, nothing
will allow get pretty decent measurement amount light
energy coming toward you. hold cloudy morning, don't
think bright kind dismal day, notice there'll 1,000, 2,000,
even know, 5,000 Lux, Lux just measure brightness, course.
can point light meter toward indoor light seems bright
intense it'll say 500 Lux realize intensity gauge it,
perceptually not really system receiving. outdoor light key.
get natural stimulation? just say light stimulation early day,
typical, Matt Walker get light stimulation? - no
poster child, usually will, working usually work days.
shopped around found gym huge amounts window exposure facing
East. going sound ridiculous know, Matt Walker chooses gym
basis. - love - solar impact cannot know correct circadian. -
lot criteria selecting gyms, one actually grounded physiology,
biology so. - selfishness sleep. - No great. get
exercise light stimulation simultaneously? - right, yep, yeah. -


stacking cues wakefulness early day. - Exactly, exercise
daylight wonderful cues circadian rhythm alignment, also circadian rhythm
reset day. will use exercise, mean, neither strong morning
type strong evening type. preference exercise probably sometime
middle day, probably somewhere around 1pm sorry, not 1am. usually
working probably around sort seven, sort 45 8am time, usually
start workout. will start cardio spin bike facing window.
luckily, part California, usually sunlight coming through.
doesn't matter just said, even cloudy day Lux
coming light, intensity splendid. prefer favor exercise
just efficiency too, want get also working day, try match
exercise circadian light exposure probably going
really want crush workout, want just, know, make sure good
workout? prefer work out, know, different time. like
daylight. can speak exercise timing point,
lot discussion around that, right time exercise sleep.
can sort bust myths too. think spot suggestion, get
morning daylight, try get exposure, usually least 30 40 minutes,
great work recently coming occupational health domain,
moved workers offices just facing walls know, didn't
exposure natural daylight. time period study
actually front window working. measured sleep
sleep time sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically. forgetting
numbers now think increase total sleep time well 30 minutes.
improvement sleep efficiency five 10%. know, batting
80%, know, sleep efficiency average, bit concerned that. add 10%
now know, great echelon healthy sleepers.
just spend time working front windows. - great probably folks
might want consider spending little less time sunglasses provided can
safely, know, driving, etcetera. not alone exercise behavior
facing East. one Tim Ferriss told recently morning routine
nowadays consists jumping rope facing East get sunlight stimulation
eyes. Matt know, eyes, right? portals
way



00:49:20 Caffeine

convey rest brain body time day wakefulness. Along
lines wakefulness, number questions caffeine. dreaded
beloved caffeine, love caffeine, like relatively restricted periods time.
big fan waking even though wake groggy, allowing natural
wakefulness signals take hold, meaning wake slowly, don't drink
caffeine right away. sort delay caffeine little while, usually 90 minutes two
hours. idea came basis understanding caffeine
adenosine receptor interact. feeling going pronounce adenosine
differently do. - No, no, will that, will go adenosine. - tried go
skeletal instead skeletal synapse synapse. - Schedule schedule. -
go. make really simple folks, caffeine work make us
feel alert? timing ingest caffeine play important role
whether not works us us? maybe just start
caffeine work? drink mate coffee, preferred
sources caffeine, feel mental physical lift? - Yeah going suggest
counter people think, drink coffee. - mate, mate okay also? -
[Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form enjoy. - come sort
suggest comes coffee, say dose timing makes
poison. start caffeine works. Caffeine class drugs call
psychoactive stimulants. works variety mechanisms, one
dopamine mechanism dopamine often think reward chemical or,
dopamine also much alerting neurochemical, well. caffeine
role seems play increasing dopamine. principal mode action, believe
terms making alert keeping awake throughout day
effects adenosine. explain adenosine moment
woke morning, chemical adenosine building brain.
longer awake, adenosine accumulates, - mask, may
ask, accumulating neurons glia, blood vessels? also
accumulating body? adenosine coming from?
accumulating? - Yeah, adenosine talking creating
sleep pressure central brain phenomenon. comes neurons


combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,

intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal

engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization

several which, not going incorporate. Matt,
amazing, deep dive sleep positive negative regulators. - hope hasn't
long. - No great. - Please cut down, shorten to, know,
five minutes meaningful stuff offered. - Absolutely not, chock block full
valuable takeaways. tremendously fun dissect incredible
aspect lives call sleep fellow scientist fellow public educator.
want say several things. First all, say people can find
although shouldn't difficult days. present internet. -
[Matthew] Unfortunately. - better worse. think wonderful
there. Look, public health service doing. No one requires
scientist get share information. sense knowing bit,
following work closely scientific work detail
public facing educational work much want best people.
interesting thing scientist clinician, know certain answers exist,
don't answers, better path, better ways
people can benefit myriad ways. So, that, know
genuine you, want best people offering tremendous advice
considerations people can take leave way view it. also want
thank taking time day sit
discussion. - Not all, no all, privilege, delight, know, I, think
alike kind lots ways. take shining example can
effectively connect public. know conversations
ever sat talk together about, know, think communicating
public pros cons that. just loved opinions.
drinking in. think third thing like say is, thank


incredible sleep ambassador, series released sleep, way
speak sleep, way moderate championed sleep.
remarkable. thank just know, brother arms way. -
thanks words. 99% discussed work
colleagues sleep field. proper acknowledgement, thank you,
can people learn currently? coming
next? Twitter. - Twitter typically tweet. - sleep diplomat. - So,
no just sleep diplomat - Sleep diplomat Twitter. - Sleep diplomat Twitter,
sleepdiplomat.com website, want learn science here,
humansleepscience.com. Center Human Sleep Science. can pick
copy book, want. called "Why Sleep?" curious
sleep, one path take view. - another might someday
future? - think may be, yeah. - Great, great, many, many millions people will
happy hear that. - think starting take hold. discussed,
kicking around idea short form podcast rather long form, not
long form, don't mental capacity interviewing, just capability
someone like has. will probably just monologue short form.
interest, probably well. ways people can find
me. overall, interested sleep, just listen Andrew. thing can tell
people. - right, well now bating back forth vector action speak,
hope start podcast however brief lengthy episodes turn
believe great venue get information world.
don't just want hear Matt Walker, speak many people, need to,
work influential, importantly, important work.
impact needed, especially day age science medicine,
public health, issues world, etcetera, really converging. know
speak behalf tremendous number people, just say thank
work you. - [Matthew] Thank you. - thanks good
friend. - Likewise, way, just going note nice two
us got Johnny Cash memo dress today. seems though
kind got memo, will mean nothing people

day want awake. Essentially, phase 24 hour
circadian cycle temperature rising, starting get less light eyes
temperature going terms later day evening.
adjustments general theme like add? way? -
No, think exactly recommend right now. try get least 30
40 minutes exposure kind natural daylight. Now, may parts
world where, know, it's. - rather cloudy part world. -
Liverpool, England, Northwest England not known beach
resorts fine weather. remember sort of, went back home trip first
California, thought, sky low? Just know, constantly
joke UK, usually nine months bad weather three
months Winter. entire year terms climate. come
point, exactly right, try get daylight. Now can know, working
next window getting natural sunlight. natural sunlight even
cloudy day England usually far potent anything get
indoor lighting, despite thinking sort perception wise, maybe much
closer think. - Yeah, sorry interrupt. big
proponent app called Light Meter, will free app, nothing
will allow get pretty decent measurement amount light
energy coming toward you. hold cloudy morning, don't
think bright kind dismal day, notice there'll 1,000, 2,000,
even know, 5,000 Lux, Lux just measure brightness, course.
can point light meter toward indoor light seems bright
intense it'll say 500 Lux realize intensity gauge it,
perceptually not really system receiving. outdoor light key.
get natural stimulation? just say light stimulation early day,
typical, Matt Walker get light stimulation? - no
poster child, usually will, working usually work days.
shopped around found gym huge amounts window exposure facing
East. going sound ridiculous know, Matt Walker chooses gym
basis. - love - solar impact cannot know correct circadian. -
lot criteria selecting gyms, one actually grounded physiology,
biology so. - selfishness sleep. - No great. get
exercise light stimulation simultaneously? - right, yep, yeah. -


stacking cues wakefulness early day. - Exactly, exercise
daylight wonderful cues circadian rhythm alignment, also circadian rhythm
reset day. will use exercise, mean, neither strong morning
type strong evening type. preference exercise probably sometime
middle day, probably somewhere around 1pm sorry, not 1am. usually
working probably around sort seven, sort 45 8am time, usually
start workout. will start cardio spin bike facing window.
luckily, part California, usually sunlight coming through.
doesn't matter just said, even cloudy day Lux
coming light, intensity splendid. prefer favor exercise
just efficiency too, want get also working day, try match
exercise circadian light exposure probably going
really want crush workout, want just, know, make sure good
workout? prefer work out, know, different time. like
daylight. can speak exercise timing point,
lot discussion around that, right time exercise sleep.
can sort bust myths too. think spot suggestion, get
morning daylight, try get exposure, usually least 30 40 minutes,
great work recently coming occupational health domain,
moved workers offices just facing walls know, didn't
exposure natural daylight. time period study
actually front window working. measured sleep
sleep time sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically. forgetting
numbers now think increase total sleep time well 30 minutes.
improvement sleep efficiency five 10%. know, batting
80%, know, sleep efficiency average, bit concerned that. add 10%
now know, great echelon healthy sleepers.
just spend time working front windows. - great probably folks
might want consider spending little less time sunglasses provided can
safely, know, driving, etcetera. not alone exercise behavior
facing East. one Tim Ferriss told recently morning routine
nowadays consists jumping rope facing East get sunlight stimulation
eyes. Matt know, eyes, right? portals
way



00:49:20 Caffeine

convey rest brain body time day wakefulness. Along
lines wakefulness, number questions caffeine. dreaded
beloved caffeine, love caffeine, like relatively restricted periods time.
big fan waking even though wake groggy, allowing natural
wakefulness signals take hold, meaning wake slowly, don't drink
caffeine right away. sort delay caffeine little while, usually 90 minutes two
hours. idea came basis understanding caffeine
adenosine receptor interact. feeling going pronounce adenosine
differently do. - No, no, will that, will go adenosine. - tried go
skeletal instead skeletal synapse synapse. - Schedule schedule. -
go. make really simple folks, caffeine work make us
feel alert? timing ingest caffeine play important role
whether not works us us? maybe just start
caffeine work? drink mate coffee, preferred
sources caffeine, feel mental physical lift? - Yeah going suggest
counter people think, drink coffee. - mate, mate okay also? -
[Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form enjoy. - come sort
suggest comes coffee, say dose timing makes
poison. start caffeine works. Caffeine class drugs call
psychoactive stimulants. works variety mechanisms, one
dopamine mechanism dopamine often think reward chemical or,
dopamine also much alerting neurochemical, well. caffeine
role seems play increasing dopamine. principal mode action, believe
terms making alert keeping awake throughout day
effects adenosine. explain adenosine moment
woke morning, chemical adenosine building brain.
longer awake, adenosine accumulates, - mask, may
ask, accumulating neurons glia, blood vessels? also
accumulating body? adenosine coming from?
accumulating? - Yeah, adenosine talking creating
sleep pressure central brain phenomenon. comes neurons


combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

lot discussion around that, right time exercise sleep.
can sort bust myths too. think spot suggestion, get
morning daylight, try get exposure, usually least 30 40 minutes,
great work recently coming occupational health domain,

00:49:20 Caffeine

convey rest brain body time day wakefulness. Along
lines wakefulness, number questions caffeine. dreaded
beloved caffeine, love caffeine, like relatively restricted periods time.
big fan waking even though wake groggy, allowing natural
wakefulness signals take hold, meaning wake slowly, don't drink
caffeine right away. sort delay caffeine little while, usually 90 minutes two
hours. idea came basis understanding caffeine
adenosine receptor interact. feeling going pronounce adenosine
differently do. - No, no, will that, will go adenosine. - tried go
skeletal instead skeletal synapse synapse. - Schedule schedule. -
go. make really simple folks, caffeine work make us
feel alert? timing ingest caffeine play important role
whether not works us us? maybe just start
caffeine work? drink mate coffee, preferred
sources caffeine, feel mental physical lift? - Yeah going suggest
counter people think, drink coffee. - mate, mate okay also? -
[Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form enjoy. - come sort
suggest comes coffee, say dose timing makes
poison. start caffeine works. Caffeine class drugs call
psychoactive stimulants. works variety mechanisms, one
dopamine mechanism dopamine often think reward chemical or,
dopamine also much alerting neurochemical, well. caffeine
role seems play increasing dopamine. principal mode action, believe
terms making alert keeping awake throughout day
effects adenosine. explain adenosine moment
woke morning, chemical adenosine building brain.
longer awake, adenosine accumulates, - mask, may
ask, accumulating neurons glia, blood vessels? also
accumulating body? adenosine coming from?
accumulating? - Yeah, adenosine talking creating
sleep pressure central brain phenomenon. comes neurons


combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep

however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes

naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.

reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen

profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal

engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs

00:49:20 Caffeine

convey rest brain body time day wakefulness. Along
lines wakefulness, number questions caffeine. dreaded
beloved caffeine, love caffeine, like relatively restricted periods time.
big fan waking even though wake groggy, allowing natural
wakefulness signals take hold, meaning wake slowly, don't drink
caffeine right away. sort delay caffeine little while, usually 90 minutes two
hours. idea came basis understanding caffeine
adenosine receptor interact. feeling going pronounce adenosine
differently do. - No, no, will that, will go adenosine. - tried go
skeletal instead skeletal synapse synapse. - Schedule schedule. -
go. make really simple folks, caffeine work make us
feel alert? timing ingest caffeine play important role
whether not works us us? maybe just start
caffeine work? drink mate coffee, preferred
sources caffeine, feel mental physical lift? - Yeah going suggest
counter people think, drink coffee. - mate, mate okay also? -
[Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form enjoy. - come sort
suggest comes coffee, say dose timing makes
poison. start caffeine works. Caffeine class drugs call
psychoactive stimulants. works variety mechanisms, one
dopamine mechanism dopamine often think reward chemical or,
dopamine also much alerting neurochemical, well. caffeine
role seems play increasing dopamine. principal mode action, believe
terms making alert keeping awake throughout day
effects adenosine. explain adenosine moment
woke morning, chemical adenosine building brain.
longer awake, adenosine accumulates, - mask, may
ask, accumulating neurons glia, blood vessels? also
accumulating body? adenosine coming from?
accumulating? - Yeah, adenosine talking creating
sleep pressure central brain phenomenon. comes neurons


combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

combusting energy. combusting energy, one offshoots
chemical adenosine. awake throughout day,
brain metabolically active, accumulating building adenosine. Now,
adenosine have, sleepier will feel. really like sleep
pressure call it. Now, not mechanical pressure, don't worry, head's
not going explode, chemical pressure. weight sleepiness
feel gradually growing get evening. - May just interrupt just
ask know circuit mechanism that? mean, not go far
rabbit hole, aficionados myself, brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus release things brain areas locus coeruleus just
brain area, course release things proactively create wakefulness.
neurons shutting consequence much adenosine?
areas brain promote sleepiness getting activated?
these, can imagine things working parallel, one
accomplish endpoint? - Yeah both. two main
receptors adenosine A1 receptor A2 receptor. different
modes activating brain cells inactivating decreasing likelihood firing.
adenosine works beautiful, elegant way, will inhibit shut
wake promoting areas brain whilst also increasing dialing volume
sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh
fantastic. - push pull, mean, larger discussion
point that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. ability smell
sense pressure this, everything's push pull Biology. - Oh great, yeah, yep. -
another example awake longer, adenosine released
brain. wakefulness areas actively shut adenosine
sleepiness brain areas, speak, promoted active,
correct? - right progressive process. not like step function,
sometimes happens occasionally, usually
sort driving come caffeine system,
sudden just hit wall just, know engulfs go zero
one sleepiness within short period time. - explains fatigue
hard conversation? desire go sleep desire go sleep hard
conversation? - interesting one. think usually just based personality
type interactions. part. - Not ever experienced before. - No


people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying

data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer

whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10

kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't

counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk

going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people

hope start podcast however brief lengthy episodes turn
believe great venue get information world.
don't just want hear Matt Walker, speak many people, need to,
work influential, importantly, important work.
impact needed, especially day age science medicine,
public health, issues world, etcetera, really converging. know
speak behalf tremendous number people, just say thank
work you. - [Matthew] Thank you. - thanks good
friend. - Likewise, way, just going note nice two
us got Johnny Cash memo dress today. seems though
kind got memo, will mean nothing people
listening, watching video, probably see mean. Andrew,
thank taking time. Thank much. - Thanks much Matt. Thank

people don't, me, they. - Oh no, no, experienced desired
conversations, halfway feel like want take nap. -
Yeah. - Right. - love look know, people's sleep history. sort
seen time time again, be, know, folks like me,
people just lose will live within five minutes speaking me, so. - Not
true, hear sleep important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew]
awesome. - flattery, great. way caffeine comes
equation, saying, usually kind linear process. maybe
probably closer exponential terms subjective feeling sleepiness.
haven't really able measure humans, normally, hard
actually, know, stick something brain be, know, sucking,
siphoning off stuff every couple minutes, animal studies. keep
asking people every couple minutes, sleepy feel, sleepy? track
see linear rise in, know, adenosine, creates exponential
rise subjective sleepiness dynamics are, kind nerding out.
Caffeine comes play here, caffeine comes system latches
welcome sights adenosine adenosine receptors. doesn't
latch activate them. that, would,
know, lots ways dial sort sleepiness. opposite.
way caffeine works comes in, competes quite sharp elbows
adenosine competitively forces way, hijacks receptor latching
onto it, just essentially blocks it. doesn't inactivate receptor, doesn't
activate receptor, functionally inactivates sense takes
game adenosine. like someone know, coming room, just
sit chair, caffeine comes just pulls chair.
like, well, now got nowhere sit. caffeine just keeps pulling
chairs adenosine adenosine even though concentration
brain, brain doesn't know awake for, know, 10 hours, 16 hours
point downed cup coffee. adenosine
still can't communicate brain awake 16 hours because. -
adenosine still brain circulation. - Correct. - real question
happens caffeine dislodged adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things
happen. call caffeine crash. caffeine half life
metabolized and. - recall half life is? - Yeah, half life


somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations
action, average adult five six hours. variation, understand
liver enzyme set liver enzymes class call cytochrome P450
enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA

however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,

naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way

naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,

describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,

suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,

mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,

somewhere five six hours. quarter life therefore somewhere
10 12 hours. variable, different people different durations

enzymes. think last delved data, pretty recently,
two gene variants will dictate enzymatic speed liver breaks
caffeine. can people sensitive
caffeine people say, know, just doesn't affect really much
all. - people double espresso 9pm dinner can
sleep just fine. - Well, come onto. - Well least subjectively think
sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, speak assumptive danger too.
caffeine system time period, will inactive
system. say that, know, awake 12 hours now.
know, 8pm feeling bit tired, want push want keep
working another couple hours, cup coffee. sudden
feeling tired, don't feel like awake 12 hours anymore.
caffeine system, maybe half adenosine communicated
receptor brain. 100% adenosine still there, half
allowed communicate brain. now think oh haven't awake 12
hours, just awake six hours, feel great. hours,
caffeine starting come system, not hit levels
adenosine cup coffee several hours ago, plus,
adenosine building time caffeine
system. - sort avalanche adenosine. - tsunami wave, yeah
caffeine crash. - interesting caffeine crash two o'clock
afternoon work terrible thing. person,
maybe person 20s, says, going drink caffeine day long.
want crash. nine 10pm, stop drinking caffeine say,
6pm, crash, crash slumber, deep night sleep. sleep really
deep think is? given half life caffeine mentioned
moments ago, imagine caffeine circulating
system might disrupt depth sleep, somehow architecture sleep way
even get eight, knows even 10 hours sleep, might not
restorative like be. - Yeah, danger, just sort that,


know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

know, people described say, I, lot will speak
say, look, can two espressos dinner fall asleep fine stay
asleep. usually two phenotypes typically see
much caffeine. just can't fall asleep easily want to, fall asleep, just can't
stay asleep. caffeine can things quite potently. - late
day think assuming somebody, translate folks, go bed earlier
later, shift hours accordingly. given somebody typically gets
bed around 10:00, 10:30, falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.
recommend halt caffeine intake? not strict prescriptives, think
people benefit fairly clear guidelines might work them.
say cut off caffeine, time day? - usually say take
typical bedtime count back sort somewhere 10 eight hours probably
getting little bit close. take back sort 10 hours eight hours time,
time really stop, know, using caffeine suggestion.
reason people even just keep drinking know,
evening, right, can fall asleep fine, maybe stay asleep,
depth deep sleep not deep anymore. two consequences.
first me, can 30%, drop deep sleep
30%, age 10 12 years, can just every night
couple espressos. second wake next
morning, think, well, didn't problems falling asleep didn't
problems staying asleep, don't feel particularly restored sleep. now
reaching three four cups coffee next morning, rather just two three
cups coffee. goes dependency cycle, need uppers
wake morning, sometimes people will use alcohol evening
bring overly caffeinated alcohol, can speak
that, too, also deleterious impacts sleep well. right
not just quantity sleep, even difficulties falling staying asleep,
can also deep sleep. again, think, know, don't want frightening
people. mentioned before, think one real problems mistakes
made, didn't know, never much public exposure
book. saddened know, disease suffering
seeing consequence lack sleep society. fact wasn't
really discussed much. sort came out, know, little bit headstrong,


little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want
be, know, want theoretical comes science, want
faithful science. also don't want go scare living daylights
people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink
coffee. just want make point. - Yeah, well, appreciate making
point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging
contained clearly clearly net positive people needed cued
this. - Thank you. - sleep dead mentality one had, one
people have. People huge number vital communities, not just
students, also people messaging provided continue
provide positively impacted first responder community, medical community,
there're still steps need taken military community, course,
civilian community. think adjustments yeah, caffeine okay, just
restricted early part day, can, days, mean, think law
averages. like light viewing behavior think critical view sunlight natural,
form bright light early day miss day, not
whole system going dissolve puddle tears. That'll happen second
third day, no kidding, got couple days. Biology works averages
except respect accident injury. car accident car accident, right?
don't get three brain damage occurs accident's severe


enough. sleep behavior, homeostatic type behaviors, food, one
chocolate sundae, going kill know? No. Every night? Yeah. going make
demented kill early. know this. think middle ground often
hard place achieve. think done phenomenal job. appreciate
raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

little bit headstrong. think was, know, perhaps much gas
pedal little, know, break were. don't think right way
approach health message within public sphere. become much softer
think things. ideas ideal world looks like
sleep. also realize none us live thing called ideal world. -
certainly don't. - So, know, want really mindful that, think done
really bad job sort forthright, particularly people struggle
sleep, know, early on, offer sort messages sleep. want

people, particularly people struggling sleep, 'cause probably
going make matters worse. beautifully schooled learning
slightly better public communicator. nowhere near standing are,
elegant intuitive you. still training wheels, getting
little bit better. just want say speaking caffeine, 'cause
sounds though sort overt it. will come back say drink

point. sure listeners will too. still will stand behind statement,
done notion sleep vital aspects health
performance, mental physical wakefulness, message packaging

there're still steps need taken military community, course,

alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned

certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying

not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer

kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,

going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night

there. Look, public health service doing. No one requires
scientist get share information. sense knowing bit,
following work closely scientific work detail
public facing educational work much want best people.
interesting thing scientist clinician, know certain answers exist,
don't answers, better path, better ways
people can benefit myriad ways. So, that, know
genuine you, want best people offering tremendous advice
considerations people can take leave way view it. also want
thank taking time day sit
discussion. - Not all, no all, privilege, delight, know, I, think
alike kind lots ways. take shining example can
effectively connect public. know conversations
ever sat talk together about, know, think communicating
public pros cons that. just loved opinions.
drinking in. think third thing like say is, thank


incredible sleep ambassador, series released sleep, way
speak sleep, way moderate championed sleep.
remarkable. thank just know, brother arms way. -
thanks words. 99% discussed work
colleagues sleep field. proper acknowledgement, thank you,
can people learn currently? coming
next? Twitter. - Twitter typically tweet. - sleep diplomat. - So,
no just sleep diplomat - Sleep diplomat Twitter. - Sleep diplomat Twitter,

copy book, want. called "Why Sleep?" curious
sleep, one path take view. - another might someday
future? - think may be, yeah. - Great, great, many, many millions people will
happy hear that. - think starting take hold. discussed,
kicking around idea short form podcast rather long form, not
long form, don't mental capacity interviewing, just capability
someone like has. will probably just monologue short form.
interest, probably well. ways people can find
me. overall, interested sleep, just listen Andrew. thing can tell
people. - right, well now bating back forth vector action speak,
hope start podcast however brief lengthy episodes turn
believe great venue get information world.
don't just want hear Matt Walker, speak many people, need to,
work influential, importantly, important work.
impact needed, especially day age science medicine,
public health, issues world, etcetera, really converging. know
speak behalf tremendous number people, just say thank
work you. - [Matthew] Thank you. - thanks good

raising points. think clear need can
certain things better,

01:07:54 Alcohol

including gentle time time deviate ideal
circumstances. Along lines, want talk alcohol think caffeine
alcohol represent kind two opposite ends spectrum. Clearly
stimulants. Adderalls high energy drinks people use.
alcohol caffeine commonly consumed stimulants sedatives,
depressants sometimes called. happens somebody
glass? always hear glass two wine evening cocktail dinner
dinner, impact sleep? sure circle back
terms reasonable ranges behavior comes avoiding alcohol
age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, alcohol, thinking
classes drugs, class drugs call sedatives. think
one first problems people often mistake, alcohol often used sleep aid
people struggling sleep things like counter remedies,
etcetera, herbal remedies just not worked them. alcohol,
unfortunately, anything sleep aid. first reason people use try
help fall asleep. - process event call falling asleep,
imagine process. - process. - Like everything biology,
process involves way, talked push pull turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, turning sort relaxation mechanism. imagine
two things knobs turning opposite directions gives us outcome
call falling asleep. Alcohol, seems helpful people turn off
thoughts planning. right? - Yes, is. think, know, look
pattern brain activity, place inside MRI scanner,
looking activity brain watch drifting off, parts brain
will become less active. parts will become active. push pull


model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA

however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes

naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way

naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,

describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal

engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,

just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage

model. inhibition excitation. alcohol quite different regard. Alcohol
sedative, really trying essentially knock
cortex. sedating cortex, sedation not sleep. couple
drinks evening, couple nightcaps, mistake sedation
sleep saying, well, always couple whiskies couple cocktails,
always helps fall asleep faster. truth, happening losing
consciousness quicker, not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
quicker. one first sort things just keep mind. second thing
alcohol fragments sleep. spoke quality sleep
just important quantity. alcohol variety mechanisms,
activation autonomic nervous system, fight flight branch
nervous system. Alcohol will actually waking many times
throughout night. sleep far less continuous. Now,
awakenings will conscious recollection next day, just remember waking
up, many won't be. yet, sleep will littered sort
punctured awakenings throughout night. again, wake next
morning, don't feel restored sleep, know, fragmented sleep non
continuous sleep alcohol induced way, usually not good quality sleep,
feel great next day. third part alcohol terms equation
quite potent blocking REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. REM
sleep critical variety cognitive functions. aspects learning
memory seems critical aspects emotional mental health. -
described sort self generated therapy occurs sleep. -
Yeah, overnight therapy, know, emotional first aid. - Certainly people
don't get enough sleep easy derail emotionally. Not one want
people, sort fall apart emotionally. always think almost
like skin sensitivity can heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - sleep
deprived. emotional sensitivity sleep deprived,
takes much finer grain sandpaper create kind friction, things bother us. -
[Matthew] Threshold trigger. - Even online comments bother us sleep
deprived. never well rested. - love say never look
them, except look at. - Well actually, I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one them. -
will editorialize notion not looking comments unreasonable
ask academic, academics trained look teaching


evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get

reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want

profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal

not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization

Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak

evaluations. just like online comments ignore 20% them, no, kidding.
look event. terms translating behavior, not,
don't particularly enjoy alcohol, guess might fortunate sense. also
never really experienced pleasure drinking alcohol. sometimes like taste
drink, never like sensation. that's, don't lot familiarity this,
many people do, understand that. say somebody enjoys glass wine
two dinner eat dinner 7pm. likely disrupt sleep all?
just sort of, make series gradations. - answer yes. think
just looked single glass wine evening dinner,
untruthful didn't just simply say effect. can measure terms of.
- Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep one fascinating studies can't remember
dose think got close standard illegal blood alcohol level, maybe
little bit tipsy. yes, see changes just described,
sort lose consciousness quickly,

01:14:30 Growth Hormone & Testosterone

fragmented sleep, significant reduction REM sleep.
also interesting REM sleep, spoke before, time
hormonal systems essentially recharged refreshed growth hormone
one them, well 50% five zero drop growth hormone
release alcohol laced sleep night. - growth hormone vital
metabolism repair tissues. - Yeah, not just kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body
fat low. - essential adults. - essential, along lines, just want
highlight fact information sharing growth hormone
released strongly tethered presence healthy amounts REM sleep
interesting me, always thought growth hormone released
early part night. - Well, released across those, across different
stages, also know disrupt REM sleep,
growth hormone consequences. not exclusive system just like
testosterone, can see changes throughout non REM sleep, ask
peak release rates testosterone, right go REM sleep,
REM sleep. - course, testosterone important, males
females. - men women, yeah. - Right, libido tissue repair well being.


Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour

after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get

sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want

profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,

here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,

not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,

considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

02:59:10 Connecting & Learning Dr. Walker

several which, not going incorporate. Matt,

Nobody, regardless chromosomal, hormonal, background wants
normal levels testosterone reduced acutely, just bad equates
terrible set psychological physical symptoms. - Yeah, mortality risk
associated low testosterone

01:16:14 Emotions, Mental Health & Longevity

non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, know. coming back just
point REM sleep mentioned regarding emotional instability, see
one things one reliable signatures just insufficient sleep
doesn't sleep deprivation. discovered past 20 years
Sleep Center, no major psychiatric disorder can find
sleep normal. think firstly told us intimate
association emotional mental health sleep health.
also comes REM sleep, think fascinating not just
emotional health, not just hormonal health also seeing
aspects know, cognition. report, think
two years ago, Harvard, think Beth Clements group. found
that, replicated two different large populations. look
contribution different sleep stages lifespan, REM sleep strongest
predictor longevity. linear relationship. wasn't sort one
U shaped J shaped curves often see total sleep, mortality risk,
really linear. less less REM sleep getting higher
higher probability death. did. - death due natural
causes accident? 'Cause can imagine not getting enough REM sleep,
likely drive off freeway, step off cliff. - think cause mortal. -
just make bad decisions anything love relationships, can also life
threatening. - Yeah, tried lean claim bad relationship
situations, oh, just didn't enough REM sleep last night. - Blame sleep. -
[Matthew] darling know. - REM sleep difference. - And, far wiser
thought. But, great machine learning analysis may get
numbers backwards. think every 5% reduction REM sleep, 13%
associated increased risk mortality. have, go back check.
me, machine learning algorithm, ultimately spat


sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get

much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep

reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen

profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal

engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think

adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going

sleep stages, REM sleep predictive longevity
lifespan. often, hear people saying, can get deep sleep?
sometimes say can get dream sleep? answer question.
want get that? say, well, isn't good stuff? say,
well, actually stages good sleep. - good stuff. Well, like
exercise question took decades, people understand moving around
150, probably 180 minutes week endurance type work, zone two cardio
type work, correlated living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.
really no way around it. mean, can ingest Metformin cows come
home, can take NMN, think place certain contexts
big fan work surrounding protocols. - Yeah likewise. - without getting
proper amounts movement, meaning sufficient numbers, doesn't matter many
12 minute exercise regimes follow per week, need threshold level.
sounds like true REM sleep total amount sleep. just
pay piper somehow. - Yeah, return investment mean, flip coin,
return investment astronomical, know, think sleep tide moves,
know, raises health boats. - fundamental layer
mental physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though not physician,
ask me, know, take do? first question
always, sleep? - Great, love it. - Meaning well sleep every night
long sleep? always recommend book, always recommend
podcast, know, podcasts guest on, etcetera. knows,
maybe even release podcast

01:20:40 Books vs. Podcasts

point soon keep think people need hear
often. One thing don't want return notion public health discourse much.
want say one issue books general, can revised,
less one done kind thing next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah -
One thing like podcast format updates can provided regularly.
Corrections updates new data come out. wonderful aspect
format. hopefully format embracing, think world needs hear




01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,

least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.

bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk

several which, not going incorporate. Matt,
amazing, deep dive sleep positive negative regulators. - hope hasn't
long. - No great. - Please cut down, shorten to, know,
five minutes meaningful stuff offered. - Absolutely not, chock block full
valuable takeaways. tremendously fun dissect incredible
aspect lives call sleep fellow scientist fellow public educator.
want say several things. First all, say people can find
although shouldn't difficult days. present internet. -
[Matthew] Unfortunately. - better worse. think wonderful
there. Look, public health service doing. No one requires
scientist get share information. sense knowing bit,
following work closely scientific work detail
public facing educational work much want best people.
interesting thing scientist clinician, know certain answers exist,
don't answers, better path, better ways
people can benefit myriad ways. So, that, know
genuine you, want best people offering tremendous advice
considerations people can take leave way view it. also want
thank taking time day sit

01:21:20 Lunchtime Alcohol

often, sleep, various contours, not less. question
drinking alcohol. Not want promote day drinking, say
one two glasses wine cocktail consumed lunch, something isn't
traditionally done nowadays, late afternoon happy hour type cocktail.
one going sleep seven eight hours later, think will improve
somehow mitigate effects alcohol? drink,
basically screwed next 24 hours? - No, think going time window
dependency. Now, don't know anyone essentially done
like, time separation dose dependent curve, okay, drink
10am, 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five way know, 10pm
estimate, blast radius? linear? nonlinear?
drink last four hours? just hit exponential bad, bad
bad? curve imagine will many possibilities.
certainly know less alcohol less specifically
metabolic byproducts, aldehydes ketones, sort nefarious players. -
not ketones people excited ketones, [cross talking]
chemists know referring to. - not ketogenesis, please
don't think that. - not ketogenesis, ketone bodies,
released ingesting alcohol not positive sort ketogenic diet
might promote. - Right, think terms alcohol profile, certainly know that,
know, heading evening hours, again, timing dose make
poison. think also important, again, public message
standpoint, thank you, think leaning sort podcast consideration
arena, point, don't want puritanical here, know, just
scientist, not tell anyone live. trying empower
people scientific literature regarding sleep. can make
whatever informed choices want. Now, unlike you, turns out, not big
drinker. just never liked taste. surprised haven't
taken away British passport don't like lager beer. also want say
life lived certain degree, checks balances. So,
know, go know, ice cream sundae, not big either,


but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,

certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying

data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer

kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't

counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk

going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people

copy book, want. called "Why Sleep?" curious
sleep, one path take view. - another might someday
future? - think may be, yeah. - Great, great, many, many millions people will
happy hear that. - think starting take hold. discussed,
kicking around idea short form podcast rather long form, not
long form, don't mental capacity interviewing, just capability
someone like has. will probably just monologue short form.
interest, probably well. ways people can find
me. overall, interested sleep, just listen Andrew. thing can tell
people. - right, well now bating back forth vector action speak,
hope start podcast however brief lengthy episodes turn
believe great venue get information world.
don't just want hear Matt Walker, speak many people, need to,
work influential, importantly, important work.
impact needed, especially day age science medicine,
public health, issues world, etcetera, really converging. know
speak behalf tremendous number people, just say thank
work you. - [Matthew] Thank you. - thanks good
friend. - Likewise, way, just going note nice two
us got Johnny Cash memo dress today. seems though
kind got memo, will mean nothing people
listening, watching video, probably see mean. Andrew,

but, know, sure, know know, blood glucose not going ideal
another 12 hours maybe. just price pay kind relaxed,
fun life. don't want look back life think, gosh, know, lived was,
know, 111 utterly miserable know. - Right. - So,
kind balance. job not tell people prescription life, just offer
scientific information. - No, think terrific job that. People
always say neural circuits working properly,
circuit allows us skip information wish, right,

01:25:00 Marijuana/CBD

circuits brain thumbs working can slide right along
can drop next content however like. like ask marijuana
CBD. discussion think five years ago ventured
realm illegal now many places not medical marijuana approved legal.
certainly widespread use. Certainly not recommending people it.
thoughts marijuana CBD. fortunate, suppose don't
particularly like marijuana CBD. don't even know ever tried CBD. First all,
marijuana disrupt depth sleep, architecture sleep? so,
alcohol caffeine ingest bloodstream does,
relative go sleep, play important role? marijuana
disrupt sleep? - Yeah, does. pretty good amount data can
break sort cannabis two key ingredients. got THC
tetrahydrocannabinol, got CBD CBD sort less psychotic
think non psychoactive components. words, take CBD,
don't get high. take THC, can get high. psychoactive part
equation. - considered sedatives technical sense? - No, not.
Neither class right now. THC can, seems speed time
fall asleep. again, look electrical brainwave signature
falling asleep without THC, not going ideal fit.
argue non natural, many people use THC fact, find
difficult fall asleep. can speed onset least non consciousness, guess
best way describing it. problems THC. twofold.
first too, different mechanisms seems block REM sleep.


lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.

described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,

again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time

tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

lot people using will tell look, know, definitely,
dreaming. don't remember, know many dreams.
stop using THC, say having, know, just crazy, crazy dreams
reason rebound mechanism. REM sleep clever. alcohol
way sense, homeostatic mechanism. people will
tell me, look, bit wild Friday night alcohol, know, maybe
sleep late next morning. just really intense dreams.
thought wasn't REM sleep, well, way works
middle night, really, alcohol blocks REM sleep. brain smart
understands much REM sleep had, much REM sleep
not alcohol system. finally, early morning
hours, getting sort of, know, [cross talking] six, seven,
8:00am sudden, brain not goes back amount
REM had, plus tries get back REM sleep
lost. get back REM sleep? No, doesn't. never gets back
REM sleep, tries. really intense periods REM sleep.
Hence really intense bizarre dreams. happens also THC,
build pressure REM sleep, debt REM sleep, will ever pay
back? Doesn't seem though get back everything lost, will get
back it? Yes, brain will start devour starved
REM sleep long. one bigger problems THC worry
withdrawal dependency. start use THC sleep, can
dependency tolerance. start need get sleep benefit.
stop using, usually get severe rebound insomnia. fact,
potent typically part clinical withdrawal profile THC cannabis. -
anxiety withdrawal. know, don't ask anybody change behavior,
just said, try inform people science says let
make choices themselves. People regular pot smokers, many will
insist not addicted, maybe indeed don't actually follow profile
classical addiction, don't know. guessing do, don't. ask
well, took away marijuana consumption for, don't know, two weeks?
thought scares many them. many will experience intense anxiety without
marijuana, speaks perhaps not addiction, certain kind dependency.
again, know, know many pot smokers, jobs quite high


performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

performing manage. - Berkeley, don't know those. - Yeah, none
those, right. CBD? mean, hear much CBD, little
concerned fact analysis lot CBD supplements
confirmed much like melatonin, levels reported labels, no
way shape, form, match levels actually contained various
supplements. Sometimes levels much higher reported labels.
times, much lower. ingesting CBD architecture quality
sleep? - Right now, don't think enough data make kind of,
know, meaningful sense it. think picture emerging, however,
probably following. Firstly, CBD not seem detrimental ways
THC is. can start saying create know, potential problems, not
nature necessarily see THC. devil little bit details
data comes valid point purity. low dose,
CBD can seem wake promoting. lower doses, let see sort five 10
milligrams trying remember studies off top head,
actually may enhance wakefulness cause problems sleep.
get higher dose range, seem some, know, increases
sorry, increases sleepiness, sort sedation like, increases. usually
think, 25 milligrams, best can recall data.
look animal models, typically see type profile too.
question becomes now again, just don't know about, know, purity.
difficult, although think, again, not user, not necessarily know,
anything it. just not, know, necessarily cup tea.
firms now third party independent laboratory tests. don't know
gamed is, got no sense it. - think supplement companies
quite honest accurate amounts various substances
products not. think just huge range. think FDA
starting explore CBD certainly saw grant announcements explore
function CBD. work CBD done general public adjusting
seeing feel. gave dog dementia related
sleep disturbances, actually created heightened wakefulness completely
screwed sleep. - Okay, sounds though just wasn't. - bulldog.
going get access sleep, going take it. - Okay. - Really messed up,
took took away, better. know, canine, so. - Right,


been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep

naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.

reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen

profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

02:59:10 Connecting & Learning Dr. Walker

[Matthew] Unfortunately. - better worse. think wonderful
there. Look, public health service doing. No one requires
scientist get share information. sense knowing bit,
following work closely scientific work detail
public facing educational work much want best people.
interesting thing scientist clinician, know certain answers exist,
don't answers, better path, better ways
people can benefit myriad ways. So, that, know
genuine you, want best people offering tremendous advice

been, know, sort dose related too. - binders things
there, sure. - Correct, yeah we, right now, to, not making
statement, don't think anyone can make statement now. ends
CBD potentially beneficial sleep, can reconcile mechanistically?
think are, me, least, least three candidate mechanisms
exploring thinking about. first thermo regulatory.
found animal models CBD will create profile hypothermia.
words, cools body core body temperature down. something
know good sleep. second anxyolitic, can reduce
anxiety. data actually quite strong, even functional imaging work
coming recently showing one epicenter emotion called
amygdala deep within brain quietened CBD. think least
second non mutually exclusive. - great, conducive. - know, possibility.
think third recent data come suggesting CBD can
alter signaling adenosine. doesn't necessarily mean produce
adenosine, can perhaps modulate sensitivity perhaps brain,
weight adenosine weightier brain signal, therefore
creates stronger pressure sleep. think tentative mechanisms.
think one viable, think three viable together. right now think,
sort help think tapestry THC CBD? - Yeah much
actually, perfect segue talked caffeine, alcohol, THC
CBD sort of, framed anyway, things done moderation
appropriate times, probably okay people. Certainly not everybody,
will differences sensitivity. done incorrect times, certainly
incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt vital stage life call sleep. CBD, seems,
represents kind bridge topic like talk next,

01:36:00 Melatonin

things promotes healthy sleep, somehow contribute enhancing
architecture quality sleep. love chat moment kind
grand, original say not granddaddy OG sleep
supplementation, melatonin. called hormone darkness inhibited
light, etcetera. Frame us, melatonin context naturally occurring form.


like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -

suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,

don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak

like talk melatonin supplement experience,
anytime say word melatonin, people think supplement melatonin,
interesting phenomenon people cued role something
take, often forget something make endogenously. love
comment particular even though without necessarily getting precise
nanograms per deciliter values, typical amounts melatonin
release night? like compare contained say three
milligram six milligram tablet one might buy pharmacy. - Right, yeah. -
go sleep night, melatonin already kicked shut eyes lay
head? - Usually, yes, system working correct way, dusk starting
happen, say look hunter gatherer tribes aren't touched
electricity, sort puritanical state par excellence comes
electric light influence. usually, dusk approaching, melatonin
will start rise. lose brake pedal light coming eyes,
normally acts like hard brake pedal stamps prevents release
production melatonin. light brake pedal starts fade dusk,
ease off brake pedal melatonin spigot melatonin opened up,
melatonin starts getting released. usually see rising peak melatonin
sometime, usually hour, two hours later around varies different people
around time sleep itself. already march hours
actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, always taught assuming
still true source melatonin brain body pineal gland.
still true? - Yeah, seems best can tell pineal gland sort
meaning pea like sort shape. actually think usually people say pea like, think
look Latin derivative, more, think derived pine cone, not pea
fact, look pineal, pine cone shaped aptly
named. - human brain ever dissected confess dissected lot 'cause
teach neuroanatomy years. love looking pineal one structure
brain not sides. usually pretty easy find. pretty good
size. looks like a, looks like pea. sitting right there. remarkable
releases hormone. Sort probably entire lifespan inhibited light.
pineal starts release general circulation. imagine
melatonin receptors brain body. - correct, yep, essentially, brain
central Master 24 hour clock called super charismatic nucleus keeps


internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

internal time. Now not precise clock left devices, nothing Swiss
clock maker proud of. runs little bit long laggy. - like American
clock. couple good American watches way, Hamilton's
nice, but. - much like bug. - not famous timekeeping
punctuality matter, Swiss are. - not quite Swiss, like
Berkeley like, relaxed. Oh know whatever. adults,
average adult, say, biological clock normally runs little bit long,
24 hours 30 minutes, think last calculation. reason don't
keep drifting forward time kind running consistently, know, later
later, 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes day, central
brain clock regulated external things daylight temperature, well
food activity. essentially different fingers come along
wristwatch 24 hour clock will pull dial reset day precisely 24
hours. make point knows 24 hour time, needs tell rest
brain body, 24 hour time well. one ways
communicating chemical signal 24 hour nurse light day using
hormone, melatonin. low levels, non existent, communicating
message daytime, us diurnal species, says time awake. Yet,
nighttime, dusk approaches break comes off melatonin start
release it, signals rest brain body, look, dusk
nighttime. us diurnal species, time think sleep. melatonin
essentially tells brain body day night,
time sleep time wake. therefore, melatonin helps
timing onset sleep. doesn't really help generation
sleep itself. come studies supplementation
taught us. - tells rest brain body, time go sleep. perhaps
even aids transition sleep not going instance, ensure overall
structure sleep not conductor guiding sleep orchestra speak
throughout entire night. - Yeah, it's. - like people essentially take
seat sit give program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort
fall, less sophisticated analogy is, know, melatonin like
starting official 100 meter race Olympics. - better analogy, yeah. -
calls sleep racers line begins great sleep race. - Yeah, better
analogy way. - [Matthew] doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming


sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,

intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal

engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one

long. - No great. - Please cut down, shorten to, know,
five minutes meaningful stuff offered. - Absolutely not, chock block full
valuable takeaways. tremendously fun dissect incredible
aspect lives call sleep fellow scientist fellow public educator.
want say several things. First all, say people can find
although shouldn't difficult days. present internet. -
[Matthew] Unfortunately. - better worse. think wonderful
there. Look, public health service doing. No one requires
scientist get share information. sense knowing bit,
following work closely scientific work detail
public facing educational work much want best people.
interesting thing scientist clinician, know certain answers exist,
don't answers, better path, better ways
people can benefit myriad ways. So, that, know
genuine you, want best people offering tremendous advice
considerations people can take leave way view it. also want
thank taking time day sit
discussion. - Not all, no all, privilege, delight, know, I, think

remarkable. thank just know, brother arms way. -
thanks words. 99% discussed work
colleagues sleep field. proper acknowledgement, thank you,
can people learn currently? coming
next? Twitter. - Twitter typically tweet. - sleep diplomat. - So,
no just sleep diplomat - Sleep diplomat Twitter. - Sleep diplomat Twitter,

sleep researcher people. - doesn't participate race itself.
whole different set brain chemicals brain regions. brings us
perhaps question supplementation, is, helpful sleep? Will sleep
longer? Will sleep better? am, dosage taking? Sadly,
evidence healthy adults not older age suggests melatonin not really
particularly helpful sleep aid. think recent meta analysis
demonstrated looked different sleep parameters, melatonin,
meta analysis not knowing is, scientific sort method
use gather individual studies put big bucket
kind kind statistical fancy sleight hand. try come big
picture individuals studies tell us. meta analysis told us
melatonin will increase total amount sleep 3.9 minutes, average. -
Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - will increase sleep
efficiency 2.2%. really. - say, certain parts California,
weak sauce, weak sauce effect. - sauce not strong, force not strong
one, comes tool healthy people not older age,
doesn't seem especially beneficial. Now, know, results can vary. Everyone
different, course. talking average, called average human
adult here. - Well, melatonin, defense saying also mention,
colleague Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's
lab Harvard Med also trained terrific sleep researcher asked
melatonin essentially said thing just said little
evidence can improve sleep yet probably commonly
consumed called sleep aid. - Hundreds million dollars industry. - Yeah, either
massive placebo effect operating mechanism related
quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, essentially interesting, know,
studies see some, know, effects. Now, again,
grand average studies, just doesn't seem effect. assume
people, effect not sort completely dismissive
that, effect? One reasons become little bit
bullish melatonin sleep perspective melatonin generally a,
maybe can speak too, counter measure undergoing
insufficient sleep. two different routes there. first reason think
sleep benefit people not helps generation


sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

sleep, know doesn't, seems drop core body temperature. -
is, temperature again. fascinated days,
temperature, maybe not just reflection brain state wakefulness sleep,
actually lever quite powerful. - think both. - interest
ice baths hot showers saunas stuff, something will definitely touch
on. Temperature variation key. melatonin dropping body temperature
degree something said can help induce sleepy state. Maybe
allowing people get sleep. - think one possibility. don't think
melatonin will drop sort of, know, degree, certainly not degree
Celsius. order us fall asleep, stay asleep across night,
need drop core body temperature one degree Celsius, two
three degrees Fahrenheit. always easier fall asleep room
cold hot. think one potential avenue considering
thinking deeply comes melatonin. melatonin
antioxidant. let table now. 'Cause just get us sidetracked.
know far melatonin terms supplementation benefit lack
thereof. Two final points shouldn't forget, one population
typically see benefit, often prescribed older adults, we. -
Older meaning 60 older? - Yeah, 60, 65 older get older, can
typically called calcification pineal gland. means gland
releasing melatonin doesn't work well anymore. consequence, tend
flatter overall curve melatonin release throughout night. not
beautiful, lovely peak, bullhorn message darkness, please get sleep.
older adults can problems falling asleep staying asleep. not
reason stretch imagination. one reasons
melatonin supplementation cohorts, older adults, especially older adults
insomnia, people thought maybe appropriate use case. -
Well, along lines, compare dosages, don't, know much
melatonin typically released bloodstream per night? can use
kind rule thumb compare typical amount someone
supplement? Typically, supplements melatonin see pharmacy
elsewhere online range anywhere one milligram 12, even 20 milligrams.
guess normal night's release melatonin typical somebody 20s, 30s,
40s far lower that, correct wrong? - Yeah, many magnitudes


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying

data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer

whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10

kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't

counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk

visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece

going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night

happy hear that. - think starting take hold. discussed,
kicking around idea short form podcast rather long form, not
long form, don't mental capacity interviewing, just capability
someone like has. will probably just monologue short form.
interest, probably well. ways people can find
me. overall, interested sleep, just listen Andrew. thing can tell
people. - right, well now bating back forth vector action speak,
hope start podcast however brief lengthy episodes turn
believe great venue get information world.
don't just want hear Matt Walker, speak many people, need to,
work influential, importantly, important work.
impact needed, especially day age science medicine,
public health, issues world, etcetera, really converging. know
speak behalf tremendous number people, just say thank
work you. - [Matthew] Thank you. - thanks good
friend. - Likewise, way, just going note nice two
us got Johnny Cash memo dress today. seems though
kind got memo, will mean nothing people
listening, watching video, probably see mean. Andrew,
thank taking time. Thank much. - Thanks much Matt. Thank

previous episodes, discuss supplements. One issue supplement industry
many supplements don't contain listed bottle. therefore
partnered Thorne, T H O R N E, Thorne supplements, Thorne
supplements highest levels stringency terms purity
ingredients, precision respect listed bottle actually
contained supplement bottles. like see supplements take
sleep, things, can go thorne.com/u/huberman see
supplements take can get 20% off supplements well
supplements Thorne happens make. Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman. last, certainly not least, thank interest
science.


lower. one problems see too. see, know, typical
doses are, know, five milligrams 10 milligrams course, know,
supplement company, know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
actually doing, speak purity well. know, kind
like super gulp size, nobody wants lower price, just want know,
just give price. compete.
escalating arms race melatonin concentration, really not look
meaningful for, know, sleep way. actually found
optimal doses get sleep benefits populations looked
at, somewhere 0.1 0.3 milligrams melatonin. words,
typical doses usually 10 times, 20 times maybe body
naturally expect. call supra physiological dose. words,
far physiologically normal? know, put context, imagine
said you, want eat 20 times much food today. - thought going
use testosterone example. going take 300 times normal amount
testosterone know tons deleterious effects terrible.
yet can this. One thing concerned super
physiological levels melatonin many years ago, actually, Berkeley,
graduate student, inject animals seasonally breeding
animals melatonin. consequence gonads, either
testes ovaries shrink, many hundred fold more. words,
go nice healthy sized hamster testicles, hamster consider
healthy size hamster shrink size grain rice.
like almonds grain size grain rice. see
concerned super physiological levels melatonin. realized
melatonin different things different species. not hamsters, not
seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, might breeding
certain seasons, don't know data. nonetheless, hormones powerful.
sure optimal, sometimes see going slightly endogenous
levels certain hormones not always, can beneficial effects. sometimes
can detrimental effects. just concerned taking high levels hormone
effects reproductive axis one reasons get
concerned see people really getting aggressive melatonin supplementation
taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times amount normally


release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not

suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

02:59:10 Connecting & Learning Dr. Walker

release. concern, although not nested one specific human study.
just don't like see, certainly don't want see people don't want
personally take hormone known androgen suppressive high levels.
take that? question ask myself. - think very, know, good
point. look evidence around, know, melatonins lethality
want go extreme, part, know, pretty safe. - mean,
can take lot die? - Right, exactly yeah. - don't know
criteria. - yardstick for, because, know, really need
think your, know, health, not just whether thing going kill
not decision matrix pop pill. comes concern
around melatonin study, think one mentioned
looked over, think least 20 different brands melatonin
supplements. found based said, bottle versus
capsules themselves, ranged from, think 83% less
said bottle 478% said bottle. Now, 10
milligram, know, pill, 478% 10 milligrams, already 10
milligrams many tens times physiological rather supra
physiological dose, need bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember hamsters
folks. Well, appreciate deep dive melatonin think people need
understand nuanced, matter dosages, timing, etcetera.
may place mentioned older individuals. mention
avid consumer supplements believe long
time. no means anti supplement. supplements refuse take avoid
taking

01:54:14 Magnesium

others quite avidly take along lines, personally don't know
thoughts are. things personally found beneficial.
love thoughts them. love tell everything
refer placebo, fine. do, scientists
argue remain friends goes away. magnesium, many
forms magnesium. Magnesium citrate know, terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, least studies seems relieve delayed


onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room
become translated people don't sleep problems, healthy
sleepers, healthy general, healthy normal levels
magnesium, take magnesium, will sleep better. data really,
not good. again, study seen magnesium
efficacy study older adults, think 60 80 years old,
may exclusively women, now think also insomnia.
population, see benefits. guess older
community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water

booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,

least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

onset muscle soreness doesn't seem create kind sedation. Two forms
magnesium aware magnesium biglycinate magnesium threonate.
believe based data can actively cross blood brain barrier. put
gut, needs go brain order sedative
effect. thoughts magnesium supplementation? supplement
magnesium? studies like see done haven't done
already. - don't supplement magnesium. think threonate interesting
higher capacity cross blood brain barrier actually
central nervous system effect. reason interests
sleep brain brain, also brain, well body. just
don't particularly good set studies targeted exclusively threonate.
lots studies just looked magnesium general sleep.
overall, data uncompelling. - Interesting. - while, confused
why, come kind myth magnesium? started looking
back literature best traced least far can tell, early studies
showing deficient magnesium also sleep problems.
problems too, course, sleep problems one set sequelae
came lower magnesium. supplemented magnesium
tried restore levels, sleep problems dissipated.
seems gotten lost sort game sort like whispers around room

not good. again, study seen magnesium

community well, probably deficient magnesium. fit former
category simply deficient, restore, can help sleep sort
return normal. not deficient healthy, not old
don't insomnia, supplementing thinking provides sleep, right
now, data isn't supportive that. just don't think enough threonate
data actually speak that, just blood brain barrier issue
far forms. - maybe additional studies looking specifically


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,

intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal

engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed

you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.

previous episodes, discuss supplements. One issue supplement industry
many supplements don't contain listed bottle. therefore
partnered Thorne, T H O R N E, Thorne supplements, Thorne
supplements highest levels stringency terms purity
ingredients, precision respect listed bottle actually
contained supplement bottles. like see supplements take
sleep, things, can go thorne.com/u/huberman see
supplements take can get 20% off supplements well
supplements Thorne happens make. Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman. last, certainly not least, thank interest
science.


threonate bi-glycinate useful. - love have. - Magnesium involved
many cellular processes, can imagine effect, truly exists is,
say, science noise, meaning jitter data, isolate real
effect

01:58:10 Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin

one needs refined studies. things interest
you, not things happen take? not things personally take
mostly just haven't experimented them. valerian root one, tart cherry
kiwi fruit. Tell Valerian root, tart cherry kiwi fruit. new me.
certainly heard them. tart cherry Kiwi sounds delicious,
happening Valerian root tart cherry kiwi talking eating tart
cherries Kiwis Valerian roots? - Yes. - talking taking pill
form? - Usually supplements, also tart cherries kiwis.
actual, know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted beneficial sleep aid
lots people swear too. evidence actually quite that. - Oh really?
- Not makes sleep worse, least seven good studies
able find, typically nature call randomized
placebo crossover design. won't bore people means sort one
the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, one sort gold standard methods
looking intervention studies drugs studies. Five
seven found no benefits Valerian root sleep. two seven,
data just insufficient. think power issue just couldn't make
strong conclusions. think recent study, think looked
two different doses Valerian wrong just failed find
effects again, stunning part paper, recall, big
table different sleep metrics looked at. well
25 different things tried see valerian impacted. none
significant. stuns statistical probabilities, know, just
randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances probabilistically, just get one
significant result random chance. even random chance side,
still couldn't find benefit Valerian, so. - Valerian root might worse nothing
all, is, speak. - mean, again, placebo effect can think too.


say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.

say feel though benefit you,
caveats supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et
cetera, know, maybe no harm no foul. not know, medical doctor
don't tell anyone disclaimers not recommending
things. - include these, mean, always say, know, not
physicians, don't prescribe anything. scientists professors profess
things. people responsible health. Not just protect us
protect themselves. want hear tart cherry kiwi fruit. story
there? - Strange, isn't it? was, know, kind hard nosed scientist,
people know, years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, thing kiwi
fruits, thinking, oh, goodness, sounds bit. - California
little long. - Yeah, know, yeah, sun softened some. thought, look one
things scientists open minded possible.
not quick dismiss. went literature just started reading much
it. three really good randomized placebo crossover trials
tart cherries. found one study, reduced amount
time spent awake night hour. two studies, one
found increased amount sleep got 34 minutes.
increased amount sleep got 84 minutes. know,
are, striking independent studies, think, meaning
independent groups, were, know, guys,
know, girl, know pretty well, really. - know trust
work. - Right, really trust work too. - ingesting actual tart cherries
drinking juice capsule form? - juice. three studies,
juice. Although can think supplement, can buy capsule,
got no idea whether changes benefit not. also interesting
think last study got increase sleep 84 minutes, also
decreased daytime napping significantly. - one certainly make use
of. love day time naps, love skip too. - Right can speak
naps sort upside downside that. made think well,
case, may net net benefit sleep overall, no different. just
decreases amount time people taking sleep day,
giving back night. wasn't case, 'cause added total amount
sleep getting without tart cherries, naps nightly sleep


combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization

combined, still, took tart cherries, still got net benefit, total
amount sleep. know, far, comes supplements, types
studies, good studies, data looks interesting. drug itself,
know, clinical drug, know, three studies somewhat small nature
positive benefit call preliminary data maybe
chin scratching kind keep context. - Yeah, depending margins
safety, one might think, well, given tart cherry opposed
pharmaceutical need prescription then, know, people threshold
experiment supplements quite low, people threshold quite high.
feel like know, two categories, least two categories folks there.
People hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, run try it.
people hear well, sounds crazy. that? course,
remind people tart cherry isn't really talking about, presumably
real effect, sounds like might compound tart cherries. -
right. - call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, know,
molecule, refer technical name, people say, oh, sounds
like interesting technical way approaches sleep doesn't sound natural.
groups little bit misguided sense people think
everything comes naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things grow
ground, safe, not true. people think
pharmaceuticals not evidence purified molecule, something's
not utility. Well, certainly not true. somewhere middle, think lies
answer, is, sounds like tart cherry least intriguing potential sleep
aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid underscoring potential. certainly intrigued
point might experiment bit, experimenter myself.
ask kiwi, quite good results taking something called apigenin,
derivative chamomile. supplement form, think take 50 milligrams
30 minutes sleep. subjectively experience better night's sleep,
speak. don't measure confess, don't measure sleep. not sleep tracker guy.
But, know, papers not call blue
published Blue Ribbon journals, control groups, looks somewhat
interesting. say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh
molecule. Chamomile long thought sedative, mild sedative,
sedative? drink chamomile tea? take apigenin? thoughts


apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.

bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

apigenin? - Yeah, don't. looked data regarding sleep
well. Right now best can tell mostly subjective data rather objective hard
sort sleep measures. right now know, sort unclear not no
comment, just unclear, not dismissing it, think ascribe
idea absence evidence not evidence absence. keep mind open,
least tell myself. think finding benefit, can
think personally experimenting, positive negative parts
experiment, mean is, know, say now want to,
know, think kind sleep supplement, will take kind baseline set
recordings month, will just gauge at, sort supplement free.
go month two, whatever thinking taking, don't, know,
supplement. say want experiment that. feel though
based metrics objective aura ring subjective
whatever I'm, know, writing morning, important valid,
subjective objective, like sleep world. think, okay, look,
clearly seems kind effect. key thing, however,
negative experiment, now come off another month, see, things
get worse. can see directionality, starting think maybe
believing little bit more. way sort typically approach
know, supplementation regiment it. just me, just way
mind works, but. - No, great. think scientific organized way
allows allow people make informed decisions
themselves. like that. like think terms manipulating aspect biology,
behavioral tools always first line entry, nutrition, everyone eat
sooner later, even fasting, perhaps supplementation, prescription
drugs, perhaps brain machine interface, devices use induce
something. can done combination. concerns hear
people say, well, take without thinking behavior, light
viewing behavior, etcetera. course, things work combination. - think
it's, right, many comes sleep, many low hanging
fruits don't necessarily require to, know, put sort exogenous molecules
words things like supplements body or, know, use different types
drugs help get there. Now, comes prescription sleep aids, think
little bit forthright. know clinical practice may time


place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water

booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,

least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one

Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -

don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak

place things like sleeping pills, short term solution certain forms
insomnia, not recommended long term. also know
lots ways can get sleep help can get sleep curative
profile things like cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia, non drug
approach, psychological. - quite effective understand, good data. - Just
effective sleeping pills, great data effective long term. recent
study published working therapist, benefits lasted almost
decade, know, now, stop sleeping pills, usually rebound insomnia,
sleep goes back just bad not worse. think
true, think supplementation, many things easy
implement comes sleep, don't require venturing waters.
again, not tell anyone whether venture not,
completely choice. saying want think optimizing
sleep, number ways can don't necessarily require
swallow anything inject anything know, smoking anything, free base. -
margins safety quite quite wide. one. - Yes, right
thank you. speaking low hanging fruit, don't know hangs reality,
kiwi? delicious anyway. - Yeah, humble kiwi fruit named not
shouldn't mistaken flightless bird New Zealand, native bird
there. talking kiwi fruit here, trees shrubs
mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits previously touted potentially
sleep benefit, got curious first threw out. knowledge,
really one published human study value. find
decreased speed time took fall asleep. -
ingesting whole kiwi. ingesting whole kiwi. - skin, eat
skin, people cringe see me, don't eat skin? - Well, think, no, no, no,
think idea good stuff come may actually
skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. just helped win bet. give cut.
- Okay, okay, yeah, can pay later. way skin use? No, no, no.
just told say wins, no, not. skin seems part
potential sleep equation. study, fell asleep faster stayed asleep
longer spent less time awake throughout night. just thought, well,
know, one study, can really that? another study,
however, animal model, is, know, little bit interesting.


again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

again, found similar phenotype rats, sorry mice, mice
fell asleep faster. also spent longer time sleep. sleep duration also
increased. also interesting mechanistically not mechanism
think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, know things like melatonin,
think one common binding mechanism. found animal
study block kiwifruit sleep benefits using GABA blocking agent.
Now GABA stands Gamma Amino Butyric Acid one major inhibitory
neurotransmitters brain. kind like red. - naturally occurring sedative,
sort of? - Yeah, kind red light traffic light signal, know, others
green light. GABA red light. playing around sort clever drugs
manipulate system, prevent benefit kiwi fruit sort
buggering around GABA receptor, meaning perhaps part kiwi fruit
benefit sleep mediated brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called GABA system. - exciting. - thought kind of,
convinced little bit maybe something read into.
determined, again, banner, know, tart cherries kiwi fruits data
surprised me, part preoccupied know, don't know
bit pure-ish bit snobby thinking come on, definitely not going work,
well data certainly found out. [cross talking] - look forward day
supplements no longer called supplements, end day, whether
not something effect, whether not whole kiwi fruit derivative kiwi
fruit will depend molecular compound. mentioned, potential
mechanism via GABA system, scientists get excited mechanism
'cause can trace mechanism pathway provides rationale
grounding kiwi things tart cherry things

02:15:00 Tryptophan & Serotonin

might help increase total sleep time. remiss didn't mention ask
tryptophan serotonin. can anecdotally say, taken tryptophan,
precursor serotonin, serotonin itself, horrendous night's sleep. fall asleep
easily. experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant unpleasant
kind mishmash. wake experience several days insomnia.
done positive control negative control variations


confirm that, least supplementing serotonergic agents bad
idea me. tryptophan common sleep supplement sleep aid
discussed. normal architecture sleep involves release serotonin,
timed regulated way. thoughts serotonin sleep?
kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin
precursor, tryptophan might good bad idea somebody. - think one
potential dangers based going body, can change
absorption natural sort tryptophan serotonin uptake within brain itself.
always thoughtful playing around mother nature dynamic
were. data described little bit map. people say
knocks people say just like do, terrible impact sleep.
stop, pretty bad couple days, seems lingering
effect. think happening need serotonin just
described, modulated specific ways different stages sleep.
look firing brain epicenters serotonin released,
bunch brainstem, find, release serotonin too,
awake, usually high concentrations, start drift off sleep, lowers
some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one
neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep time 24
hour period, see noradrenaline serotonin norepinephrine, completely
shut down. say serotonin, also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, just
chemical name here. whether speaking serotonin 5-HT
thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, need shut
produce REM sleep. other, one neuromodulators, ramps
produce REM sleep acetylcholine. three neuromodulators
incredible reciprocal dance generate called natural
architecture sleep throughout night. - push pull again. - push pull
again, know, know, just back. It's, know, whatever want
think of. think trying increase dramatically drive serotonin
levels night, sustains throughout night, trying get REM
sleep, artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, don't know data,
don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -
be, know say, Matt, two years time, data helped


understand potential mechanism design experiments,
go first? say look disruption REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, know, need serotonin be, know, one time
another, so. - agree everything said. personally never taking
tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one

middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,

don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak

kind put nutshell. supplementing serotonin

some, not necessarily dramatically going non REM sleep.
go REM sleep serotonin shut off. other, one

don't think anyone's really got data. - No, haven able find it. -

tryptophan serotonin again,

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.

bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.

02:19:24 Naps & Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)

unless clinical reason need that. want ask
pro sleep behaviors. that, talk naps. love
naps. come long history nappers. dad always took nap afternoon,
take 20 30 minute nap practice took liberty coining NSDR,
non sleep deep rest, sort just passive laying feet elevated.
Sometimes people yoga Nidra, hypnosis something sort,
20 30 minutes beneficial get nap
period minimal wakefulness, call go day quite well, also fall
asleep just fine. data naps? nap? thoughts
keeping naps short meaning 20 30 minutes versus getting past 90 minutes,
two hours? personally naps, yay, nay meh? - don't nap. just
never habitual napper. - don't feel sleepy afternoon,
because? - typically don't feel sleepy? - just hardier then. - am, wouldn't
say hardier, may less capable falling asleep, sleep drive. - not
dragging afternoon? - No, no, don't drag the. - don't
nap don't feel need nap? - right, yep. Now, not
immune call postprandial dip alertness. definitely feel though
can kind afternoon lull, where, know, not quite 11
o'clock morning. know physiology that, brings us back
whether designed nap. naps, done lots different studies
colleagues done studies too. Naps can really great
benefits, found benefits cardiovascular health, blood pressure, example,
found benefits levels cortisol, found benefits learning memory, also
emotional regulation. - long naps, typically, studies? - Anywhere
20 minutes 90 minutes. Sometimes like use 90 minute window
participant can full cycle sleep, therefore get non REM


REM sleep within time period. wake up, usually wait
period time get past call sleep inertia, kind window
grogginess say you, better half look, know, darling, please don't speak
first hour I've. - Don't anything right now. - first hour
waking up, know, not just, just not best version myself. wait
time period, testing. done testing
after, look change. measure benefit
naps reason sometimes 90 minutes get
stages sleep. correlate, much benefit get nap,
much benefit explained REM sleep got, deep sleep
got, light sleep got? reason use
experimental tool. also found naps little 17 minutes can
quite potent effects example, learning. None novel, NASA
pioneered back 1990s. missions, experimenting
naps astronauts. found naps little 26 minutes,
improved mission performance 34%, improved daytime alertness 50%.
birthed called NASA nap culture throughout terrestrial NASA staff
time period. long known naps can benefit. Naps,
however, can double edged sword dark side naps. comes
back story adenosine sleep pressure. longer awake,
sleep pressure adenosine build up. didn't tell
sleep, brain gets chance essentially clear adenosine.
16 hours wakefulness, eight hours sleep, eight hours sleep
seems able allow brain decrease adenosine levels back normal.
naturally, start wake also aligns circadian rhythm.
two separate processes. eight hours good quality sleep
seven nine hours average adult, free adenosine.
evacuated essentially brain, wake naturally feeling refreshed.
reason naps can potentially dangerous nap, essentially
opening valve pressure cooker sleep pressure.
sleepiness lost way nap. people not people
great example this. people, however, struggling sleep night,
nap day, makes sleep problems even worse. people
insomnia, typically advise napping. advice can nap


regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.

data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.

regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,

think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right

beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep

going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist

regularly, don't struggle sleep night, naps just fine.
struggle sleep, stay away naps. going nap, try limit naps,
try cut off bit like sort caffeine, maybe know, eight 12 hours maybe
not know far off maybe sort seven six hours good rule thumb. Try
not nap essentially late afternoon. take nap want
maintain don't want grogginess hangover can happen
full night sleep first hour, try limit 20, 25 minutes. way
don't go deepest stages sleep, wrench
alarm, just kind feel almost feel worse, first hour
nap. - definitely experienced oversleep. Certainly sun goes
nap wake light overall lighting conditions changed, find
hard jolt back evening. can screw up. try keep
naps pretty brief. say, happy hear mention individual
differences people might want nap people might not want
nap, colleague Liqun Luo familiar many neurobiologist. - Yeah
course. - absolutely spectacular scientist, member National Academy,
Howard Hughes investigator just phenom, ton energy. years ago,
learned always takes nap afternoon, much travels
give seminars universities, will tell post lunch host whoever
supposed meet with, may office 30 minutes our, sometimes 30
minute discussion 60 minute discussion, like take nap.
gives us his, talks typically afternoon academic culture.
describes effect nap short naps afternoon
profound productivity. actually inspired start feeling okay
desire nap. think me, great vindication might
feel guilty wanting nap. take heart note avoiding naps
trouble falling staying asleep, 'cause think family members
also nap, wreck, can't sleep. - Yeah, think just, often
pro sleep sort sleep community. think good always point
potential dark sides aspect. absolutely right, no one
feel guilty getting sleep need. think one big
problems society society stigmatized sleep labels slothful
lazy. almost embarrassed, know, tell colleagues take nap.
think sleep write human beings. therefore think sleep civil right


human beings. no one make feel unproud getting sleep
need. - No, love that. important point. also feel one best ways
beat competition endeavor outlive them. now know
sleep can enhance longevity lack sleep can shorten one's life,

02:28:23 Possible Get Much Sleep?

justification need anyway. Can somebody sleep much? possible
get much sleep? - good question. probably two things say
it, condition call hypersomnia. mixture things,
people either high sleep need, sleepy day.
typically falling asleep. can happen variety different clinical
contexts. One places often seen hypersomnia believed manifest
depression. look studies, turns out, looks
though people simply reporting bed longer, not necessarily
sleeping longer. fits well one profiles know
depression, anhedonia, don't get pleasure normally pleasurable
things. just don't want go world, don't want interact
depressed. do? just stay bed? - Blinds closed, watching
TV, phone. - [Matthew] Right, just looks though know, - Felling
miserable. - people say, time go bed? time get
bed? mistake made question okay, much time
sleeping said, time fall asleep? time
wake up? answer different. hypersomnia
clinical context. Can sleep much though? One data points argues yes,
possible look cause mortality. Certainly find
using sweet spot seven nine hours, start draw seven hours,
relationship, suggests shorter sleep, shorter life.
Short sleep regard predicts cause mortality. again, not linear
relationship like one seen REM sleep. get past nine hours,
mortality curve stops going down. get 10 11 hours,
hooks back again, almost like J shape, tilted little bit reversed.
strange hook, going here? Right now, sleep science least
two non mutually exclusive explanations this. first look


populations, idea whatever causing illness took
lives just much sleep deal with. However, know get sick,
one things immediately whole mechanism inflammatory
mechanisms cytokine mediated, get sick, want sleep more. just want
curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

there. Look, public health service doing. No one requires
scientist get share information. sense knowing bit,
following work closely scientific work detail
public facing educational work much want best people.
interesting thing scientist clinician, know certain answers exist,
don't answers, better path, better ways
people can benefit myriad ways. So, that, know
genuine you, want best people offering tremendous advice
considerations people can take leave way view it. also want
thank taking time day sit

get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship

appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,

touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.

curl bed know, sleep off. argument not
sleep killing people prematurely, people calling
help sleep, calling thing called Swiss Army Knife health,
sleep. whatever facing just powerful sleep
overcome. artificially looks though sleep leads higher risk death,
sleep actually responding mortality risk, lost battle. one
argument. second know sleep quality poor sleep efficiency
strong predictor cause mortality. look people often
report sleeping longer amounts, 10 11 hours, typically report poor
quality sleep. quality sleep poor, just try sleep longer try
get back. again, now poor quality sleep masking
much sleep leading artificial hook looks like mortality. second
explanation. third Gedanken, just kind like thought
experiment mentality, don't know many people share this.
actually think thing much sleep. Physiologically, think
possible. reason think no different food, water
oxygen. Can overeat? Yes, can. Can eat? course. - light. light
early part day, throughout day, wonderful. Light late day
night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, know, water, can hydrate,
hypernatremia can lead, know, happened 1990s 2000,
ecstasy craze, governments saying dehydrating dancing
night, please drink water. drunk much water, blood electrolytes went
know, place, cardiac arrests stroke. - Yeah
people dying. - dying excessive hydration. Can get
much oxygen, hypoxemia? can cause free radical damage, can
profoundly harmful kill brain cells. Can sleep much? know,
fifth element life equation, know, alongside know, food, water, oxygen,
know, forth. say can't even count. Clearly sleeping well. Yes, think
possibility. people danger getting much sleep?
contrary, look data. don't dismiss idea. think possible. -


thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going

thorough nuanced, yet clear answer. I,
interesting think lot data talking bed
long just trying compensate actual fragmentation sleep.
coming away many paths positive things
avoid. idea get nights, similar amount, probably seven nine hours,
somewhere there, high quality sleep. notion sleep quality going
become,

02:34:35 Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships

hope, phrase people think learn cultivate
practice. want ask set behaviors least aware least one
company starting track sleep monitoring device, orgasm, sex
orgasm masturbation topics are, know, somewhat sensitive.
perspective biology, right, none us not sperm meets
egg fashion, either dish vivo. data know
maybe lab even kind work exploration role
sex, orgasm, masturbation play getting sleep staying asleep sleep
quality? Certainly behaviors physiological events part
evolutionary history. story there? can say terms
science dare say practice? - Yeah, mean, almost caricature know,
movies where, know, couple makes love sudden, just
sort hear snoring or, know, happens idea somewhat
neurogenic sleep promoting. - Well, post orgasmic increase prolactin. -
Well, very, interesting. - thought set naturally occurring sedative,
presumably function in. - oxytocin also benefit see,
know, dissipation fight flight branch nervous system,
happen fall asleep. often see, know, Sleep
Center, see phenomenon called wired tired people say, look,
desperately tired just tired, can't fall asleep, wired.
sleep drive, desperately tired, wired,
got much sympathetic activation, much cortisol well, can't fall
asleep. impressive roadblock anything like good sleep. one
principal mechanisms now believe stress physiological activation,


underlying cause many forms insomnia. coming back sex, data
actually quite compelling, either subjectively assessed sleep quality,
objective amount sleep, sex resulted orgasm, think latter part
typically needs happen. - imagine so. - That, know, two
mutually exclusive individuals, are, know, beneficial terms receiving
orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, say discussion sex,
referring consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. -
Wow, never even gone species appropriate. - put species
internet, people will come sorts ideas. think
age appropriate, think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate species
appropriate, covers bases, missed any, put comment section,
sure take note. - Yeah, no, think really well said important
say. data look couples orgasm. also,
however, found benefits masturbation, not frequently spoken about.
surveys, turns people will often use masturbation sleep
tool, struggling sleep. know, sort sounds almost like strange
conversation, taboo conversation think just need open
this. - started off science, one things worked early career, not
first topic topic early influences hormones, estrogen
testosterone sexual development brain body. weaned
laboratory like that, regardless era, look sex behaviors,
hormones, physiologies scientist, clear
here, exploring behaviors perspective. mean, one thing
certain, everyone sperm met egg, either dish vivo,
said before, least 2021, no way around fact. preceded
typically act call sex sometimes, hopefully, like think orgasm
associated sexual activity. Masturbation one dimension something
think can discussed, fact, data relate sleep.
- Yeah, routes seem lead sleep benefit. Now, not saying
orgasm. think spoke oxytocin,
degree par bonding partner, experience know,
intimate loving, know, relationship involves that, can hormonal
benefits sleep promoting, may not necessarily seen just
engaging know, solo singular act masturbation. certainly know


not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided
awake. - need sort look because, know, look
suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
try remove clock faces. think one tips
people found helpful. sort slightly unconventional,
guess stock fare five tips sleep hygiene tonight, so. -
terrific sleep tips,

not someone take advice comes anything relationship wise
sex wise. - different episode podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly.
not podcast series going releasing anytime soon, going mostly
sleep. Although will touch on, release podcast sleep sex.
data far. also know works ways, though.
commonly way sleep. know, sleep exercise, sleep diet.
eat can affect sleep, sleep can affect eat.
exercise. turns out, way sexual behavior, too. here,
talking whether sex can help sleep. Can sleep help relationship
sex? answer is, yes, can. Firstly, know spoken little bit
this, reproductive hormones profound sleep regulation. -
estrogen testosterone, understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, said. - Cause
hear often testosterone. women who, say anyone
interested higher levels estrogen normal healthy levels estrogen
presume data show estrogen data also show, similarly testosterone.
get little poor quality sleep sex steroid hormones,
referred testosterone estrogen, present males females
every variation thereof, going diminished normal healthy levels, correct?
- Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH women, key hormone regulation for, key
conception, course, sex hormones seem become significantly
disrupted sleep becomes short quantity, poor quality. also know
women, sleep disruption can usually lead menstrual cycle disruption. know this,
particularly evidence shift working women nighttime shift workers,
struggle sleep day, often menstruation disrupted even becomes
impaired. also know works way, not just sex hormones, sex
itself. example, found every one hour sleep, extra sleep woman
gets interest becoming sexually intimate partner increases 14%,
is, know, non trivial amount. - Substantial. - final part think
equation comes sleep, sex relationship itself.
great work UC Berkeley Professor Serena Chen. found
restless nights mean far brutal fights relationship. this.
- vice versa. - number different elegant ways, vice versa well. - mean,
not ever conflict relationships. [cross talking] - know, just data
read, never experienced all. So, found reliably sleep


predict higher likelihood relationship conflict. Secondly, got conflict,
chances resolving significantly lower parties not
sleeping well. Part reason not well slept, empathy
goes down. not, taking abrasive stance partner,
rather agreeable stance partner. almost every dimension
human loving relationship, sleep can dramatic impact. - think really
important things underscore, one common questions get,
seems community people internet obsessed this. don't
know are, all, internet stuff shouting tunnel
getting comments back written form. bizarre conversation, speak.
whether not sexual behavior lowers increases testosterone? went
data, spans many decades actually, animal studies human studies.
seems just underscore long talking subject
seem sexual activity, sex two people seem increase
testosterone both. question orgasm no orgasm ejaculation, no
ejaculation indeed, seem effects restricting ejaculation
males form increasing testosterone. sex without ejaculation
increasing testosterone. data not clean. Presumably organizing
sorts studies getting truth self reporting probably hard get
subjects. everything sort points direction provided relationship
healthy one, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate sex two individuals seem increase sex steroid
hormones testosterone estrogen toward healthy ranges. hearing now
sort Gestalt discussion just can promote sleepiness,
restful states, quality sleep. think important conversation just
hasn't held enough. mean, sooner later, US elsewhere,
going acknowledge biological organisms sort,
choice life, things, supplementation sex, no sex, et
cetera, profound effects core biology. mean, fascinating
areas hypothalamus, preoptic area, super optic areas,
areas names might not mean anything anybody, besides Matt sitting
here, areas sit cheek jowl hypothalamus control,
sleep sex. trigger orgasm, appetite food, appetite water
electrolytes. mean, hypothalamus kind festival neurons different


booths different primitive behaviors. - small, small structure brain,
orchestrator vast number behaviors disproportionate terms
size versus effect. - Yeah, don't think can go hypothalamic festival without
least seeing booths whether not decide visit not. - love
master analogy. - glad broached conversation. hope people
will think approached appropriate level sensitivity.
important one going hear one way other. People
certainly thinking this, not engaging sorts behaviors avoiding them.
can understand biology, better. thank
bringing topic up. record, Matt, tabled discussion. -
just like chatting outside think said something sort sex,

02:47:30 Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips

said can go there. much interesting data. - Absolutely, want
touch just two remaining topics. One unconventional sleep tips
things sleep overlooked? covered everything great,
know, hear keep room cool. hear temperature
phenomenon, light aspects, considerations alcohol, CBD marijuana,
cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put hook
tart cherries kiwis, just offering know data. -
considerations whether not people batch things, won't even list off
now, many jokes one make. - no affiliation
products. [cross talking] - Well, going take stock kiwi
company. No just kidding. question unconventional
lesser known things, maybe things think things just purely
exploratory way, scientist that, know, kind things that, yeah,
turns hear just, got blank fill in. - think,
know, beyond standard, know, fair dished plenty times sleep
hygiene know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
spoken those. unconventional tips, guess? first
one, unconventional along lines naps. bad night sleep,
say starting emerge insomnia bad night
sleep, advice learned wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis,


nothing. mean is, don't wake later, don't sleep following day
try make it, don't nap day, don't consume extra caffeine wake
up, try get day, don't go bed earlier think
going compensate. can explain things. wake
later, not going sleepy late evening, going go bed
normal time won't sleeping, think well, just came off bad
night sleep. now still, can't even get sleep normal time.
slept later otherwise, reduce window
adenosine accumulation normal bedtime. don't go, don't wake
later. Don't use caffeine reasons obvious, going
crank keep awake following night decrease probability
good following night recovery sleep. Third, mentioned don't take naps,
again, will just take, know, naps, particularly later afternoon, almost liken
snacking main meal, just takes appetite off edge main
meal sleep, don't it. finally, don't go bed earlier, resist resist
go bed normal time. want try prevent thinking
bad night last night normally go bed 10:30, just going get
bed nine o'clock, last night just bad. not natural
bedtime, not aligned natural chronotype presumably kind
know something that, morning time, evening time, trying sleep
harmony, usually get best quality sleep. go bed nine,
body not ready sleep nine o'clock. worried bad night
sleep last night get bed, now tossing turning first hour
half not natural sleep window, just thought good idea.
didn't know anything sleep, think things too.
not finger wagging. bad night sleep, not immune, just
know little bit sleep doesn't mean don't bad nights, do.
Doesn't mean haven't bouts insomnia life, have. bad night
sleep, nothing. don't four things. think second tip offer
terms unconventional wind routine. Many us think sleep
like light switch, just jump bed, turn light sleep
arrive way. Just binary know off. Sleep
physiological process, much like landing plane, takes time gradually
descend onto terra firma call good solid sleep night. Find


whatever works light stretching, usually meditate 10
15 minutes bed. people like reading, try not watch television bed
usually advised against. - Something doesn't emit much light eyes. -
much light, activating, know, can listen relaxing podcasts, although
can speak technology bedroom too. kind wind
routine. know, almost like know, wouldn't race garage
come screeching halt 60 miles hour, typically down, shift gears
slow come garage, thing sleep
too. second thing, kind wind routine, find works
you. Maybe taking hot bath warm shower, stick it. Just
kids time, find bedroom, sorry, bedtime regiment
just stick faithfully 'cause humans way too. third
thing myth, don't count sheep. study done UC Berkeley, didn't
today, wish did, colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. found
counting sheep actually made harder fall asleep. made matters worse.
conter sorry counter measure find taking
kind mental walk, think nice walk take nature walk
beach, even walk around urban environment. - Just visualizing that. -
visualizing that, seemed beneficial. thing sort idea
shifting focus away mind itself, get mind off good piece
advice. Catharsis, can try write concerns have,
not right bed, usually hour two bed. people call
worry journal. me, little bit like closing emotional tabs
browser. shut computer tabs still open,
going come back morning, computer's red hot fans going
didn't go sleep, couldn't many tabs active
open. think way sleep well, try think that. just
vomit concerns page. - like that, cause 3am waking often
associated writing list things forgot need do.
eventually wake later night, second half night's sleep, stuff
seems much tractable reasonable, sure great get stuff
way sleep. - Well, also something don't think people
spoken lot. like research it, difficulty anxiety night
dark, not difficulty anxiety light day.


thoughts night, comes magnitude rumination catastrophization
disproportionate describe awake.
don't know going brain, thought emotion time, got
bunch theories why, like idea closing zipping
different components, just get page. feel, first
thought just sounds like sounds Berkeley, kind Kumbaya,
hold hands, and, know, come end day. data started
coming really good studies good people. found keeping one
journals decreased time takes fall asleep 50%, five, zero. -
Amazing substantial. - well par pharmaceutical agent. -
convinced long thought worries concerns ideas three,
4am learned not place stock them. something, glad
might decide eventually look laboratory feel like something
melted away altered. suspect regulation autonomic nervous system,
makes sense concern three, 4am evoke panic sense
concern sense. certainly, experience, although not, fortunate not
suffer full blown panic attacks. everything seems worse three, 4am provided

suicide rates, around 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates
middle sort night hours. now, don't know causative not, something
know, just time mostly lonely,
ourselves. reason. got nothing sleep night time,
don't know. third thing, think fourth sort little tip give
unconventional, remove clock faces bedroom. - Including phone. -
Including phone, resist checking it. Now know can speak
phone genie technology bottle. not going back anytime
soon. got think scientist sleep scientist, know,
know, phones bedroom. - Years ago, counselor Summer
camp worked risk kids phrase comes mind here,
channel, not dam. try dam certain kinds behavior, physically
dam certain kinds behavior not morally dam, too, just creeps edge,
get waterfall. channel. phone devices
worked negotiated not eliminated. - right know, think
mindfully clock faces, remove those, having,


know, tough night, knowing 3:22 morning, 4:48 morning,
not help slightest. going make matters worse better.
