whether not intermittent fast whether not eat small meals day long,
eat one meal evening snack then, really doesn't matter

calories burn, way exercise, basal metabolic rate, just
calories happen burn, just alive thinking breathing
heart beating, et cetera. reason many people will prefer intermittent
fasting forms just call diet nutritional framework
many people find easier not eat, limit portion size. not
talking necessarily eating disorders. talking general population. So,
think one reason much excitement intermittent fasting. Now,
within context intermittent fasting circadian timescale, every 24 hours,
generally find two categories people, people prefer not eat morning,
either not hungry morning, find relatively
straightforward just drink things like coffee water, et cetera, push feeding
window noon 2:00 P.M. 3:00 P.M. eat between, say 1:00
P.M. 8:00 P.M. 9:00 P.M.. depends individual. groups people
find hungry wake morning, don't feel well
don't eat breakfast. prefer eat early day, limit
feeding window cut off food intake stop ingesting calories
kind, somewhere around 5:00 P.M. 6:00 P.M., et cetera. So, duration
feeding window not broken kind nuanced type information
one really want. least not human studies saying, well, six hour feeding
window eight hour feeding window ideal. really going vary based
lifestyle circumstances, instance, families really want eat dinner together
every night. So, want person sitting watching everybody
eat? fasting 5:00 P.M. onwards? don't know. individual
difference. can start identify, however, people tend fall either
one category. people prefer skip eating morning people
prefer to, managed skip eating evening. no evidence


thus far, one better worse, least terms weight loss overall health
parameters. Now, can imagine people might eat breakfast dinner.
indeed several many colleagues fact just choose skip lunch,
busy day, eat breakfast dinner, doesn't afford
long, fast associated sleep. mean that? Well, went sleep
11:00 P.M. wake 6:00 A.M. extending fast 1:00 P.M.
afternoon, get quite long period no ingesting calories. Whereas
don't eat middle day, getting fasting period. probably
anywhere four seven hours, not linked longer fasting period not
eating asleep, most, people want emphasize most,
not eat asleep. going talk new disorder

eating disorder exist. interesting underlying mechanism. So,
talking this? particular, talking
episode includes discussion eating disorders? reason is, nobody not

know measurements can take, liver enzymes, blood lipid profiles, body weight,

cultural familial socio-societal influence. So, hang people
intermittent fast day, will seem normal. spend time people
never heard intermittent fasting, intermittent fasting going seem abnormal.
Now going talk eating disorders really fall category

not going stop you. not telling anybody do. mentioned earlier, nobody
knows exactly eat one's particular goals. study really interesting,
really show can utilize proteins ingested early
day, better can utilize proteins ingested later day.
course will factors can shift that. instance, work hard
resistance training later day, resistance training known increase protein

beneficial. However, study, not seem matter resistance training
fell within 24 hour schedule. morning ingestion early day ingestion amino
acids seemed beneficial. early? hours 5:00 A.M.
10:00 A.M. humans. Now just bit mechanism explain happens. So,
ingesting protein early day lead synthesis
muscle ingesting protein later day? reason turns related
circadian clock mechanism present cells, including muscle cells. So,
muscles fibers. think people aware that, muscles not just
one big blob tissue. lot little fibers contract. Within fibers,
however, cells nuclei. nuclei contained DNA. DNA transcribed
RNA. RNA translated proteins. DNA cells, including muscle
cells strong circadian regulation. one pattern gene expression

clock gene. expression clock gene varies across 24 hour cycle,
proteins downstream BMAL gene influence protein synthesis.
circadian regulation BMAL gene turns vitally important protein
synthesis mechanism. know that? Well, particular study,
mouse lacked BMAL, gene knocked out, bunch
mice. able explore whether not early day feeding effect present
absent mice lack gene BMAL. indeed absent.
words, effect increased protein synthesis early day eliminated
absence BMAL gene. So, means wake

means interested maintaining enhancing muscle tissue volume,
might want consider eating quality, protein amino acids early day,

discussion. quality protein, well quality protein going protein
includes essential amino acids. particular leucine. Now, lot
debate whether not can get essential amino acids purely
plant based diet whether not need ingest animal-based foods not.
term quality protein no strict scientific definition. people define quality protein
protein high essential amino acid caloric ratio. Now, means
is, small piece chicken steak eggs instance, will many essential amino

get essential amino acids, requires calories access essential
amino acids. Now many exceptions nuances. one,
perfectly respectful folks just want ingest plant-based foods order get

00:29:00 Anorexia Nervosa (Overview & Myths)

disorders. Now mouthful, no pun intended. major eating
disorders? Anorexia nervosa, commonly referred anorexia perhaps


prevalent dangerous eating disorders. fact, anorexia
dangerous psychiatric disorder all, even depression. probability
death untreated anorexia high, sadly prevalence anorexia
high. So, anorexia prevalent it? Anorexia, look online
talk qualified professional, essentially failure eat enough, maintain
healthy weight. can see sorts troubling symptoms somebody
anorexic period time, general loss muscle mass
ingesting fewer calories burn. Muscle metabolically active. tend
lose lot muscle mass. will low heart rate. body brain's
attempt lower energy output. will low blood pressure. sometimes
symptoms like fainting. will sometimes even hair growth face,
something called lanugo, essentially body's attempt insulate body
loss body heat. thin. Loss bone density, osteoporosis,
loss periods girls women, sorts disrupted gut immune functions.
So, just tons terrible symptoms anorexia really placed anorexic
risky state, mortality anorexia gone untreated extremely
high. Now, one misconceptions anorexia, stems
overemphasis perfectionism, images social media
advertising extremely thin fit muscular people individuals looking
comparing images thinking don't
match developing anorexia, turns not case. look
prevalence rates anorexia, last 10 years 20 years, compare
anorexia first identified, 1600s, perhaps even
earlier, find rates anorexia not going up. So, idea
images bombarded causing anorexia doesn't seem true.
Now, not say images particular young people
bombarded healthy psychological state mind. classically define
anorexia existed essentially prevalence last 100, 200, 300
400 years, incredible really speaks likelihood strong
biological contribution call anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa extremely
common. anywhere one 2% women. typical onset
adolescence close puberty, can show later life well. fact,
identification diagnosis anorexia tends early '20s. look back
history individuals, typically signs anorexia back


early teens. maybe even that. Now, course, men can anorexic
well, anorexia nervosa seem occur 10 times rate women young
girls, men young boys. So, seem
prevalence anorexia boys young men, days, probably due better
diagnosis detection sort societal shift related imagery, et
cetera. Later, will talk body dysmorphia images
present media social media impacting forms eating
disorders. look anorexia nervosa, failure maintain weight, even
healthy levels often drops weight dangerous even deadly,
existed long time, seems somewhat hardwired biology
individuals suffer it.

00:33:44 Bulimia (Overview & Myths)

Now, say hard wired, doesn't mean can't treated cured,
indeed can. Bulimia defined binge eating overeating. Let explain
is. Binge eating consuming vast amounts calories short period
time. Overeating can ingesting calories one needs, extended
period time, can exist course, bulimia also common.
common young girls women young boys men, present
sexes. Bulimia rates bulimia might increasing. sort
interesting finding. not quite clear whether not existed form
long period time within new forms evolving showing up,
going drill bulimia actually represents. one thing
want clear about, just perfectionist mindset associated
anorexia, turns not case. can be, not always associated
anorexia. idea bulimia associated early trauma
childhood, particular sexual trauma. can case, no direct
correlation two. Now, obviously psychological phenomena trauma can
profound impact way brain wires way people
approach food types behaviors. sort classic idea
anorexics perfectionists, want perform well. control
autonomy. bulimics kind dysregulated acting early
sexual trauma, stereotypes psychological framework anorexics


bulimics, doesn't hold up. look data, many, many meta analysis
done. just simply not case. instances, anorexia
bulimia, clear biological underpinnings, driving under-eating
overeating. So, going talk biology eating overeating
appropriate levels eating. that, will start identify
mechanisms serve entry points treatment anorexia bulimia.
probably aware, anorexia bulimia can comorbid,
can exist one another. anorexics will binge purge order
maintain unhealthily low weight. bulimics fit psychological
criteria anorexia. lot overlap two categories. Now
talk categorization second categorization led now
bunch eating disorders defined psychiatric community. One
classic symptoms anorexia loss menstrual cycles, loss periods.
reason body undernourished, body fat stores, send signals
brain inform body undernourished, turn off signals say,
look, enough body fat cells support healthy metabolism.
therefore shut ovulation, literally signal sent fat muscle
brain brain, hypothalamus pituitary will send signals ovaries,
will turn off signals heading ovaries deploy eggs, maturation
eggs follicle, et cetera. So, instances people anorexia
bulimia, still maintaining healthy menstrual cycles

00:37:35 Binge Eating Disorders, EDNOS, OSFEDS, Pica

least menstrual cycles. led whole set categorizations
eating disorders, like binge eating disorder, tends lot overeating,
not purging categorizations anorexia, people feeding,
not losing periods. number different names
acronyms. include things like, EDNOS, EDNOS eating disorder, not
otherwise specified. So, sub categorization OSFEDs. So, OSFEDs
specified feeding eating disorder. So, right now, look online
looking psychiatric psychological textbooks, find
huge constellation eating disorders today. mainly going talk anorexia,
bulimia, binge eating disorder body dysmorphia. can even find eating disorders


like pica, people actually ingest things like dirt rocks metal
genuine appetite things. certainly not recommend sampling
non food items. foods, incredibly dangerous. People often poisoned
themselves. often can cause structural blockages people died
sorts things. nonetheless, aspects brain biology
disrupted can lead bizarre types eating behavior, sometimes pica
caused malnutrition, not always. today going focus
prevalent eating disorders, going build toward understanding
looking healthy metabolism eating satiety hunger looks like.
one, realized not everyone eating disorder. two,
want people understand relationship think, decisions
take eat body brain subconscious levels
driving behaviors healthy otherwise. think can lead
us better understanding healthy eating us,

00:39:44 Hunger? Satiety?

increase compassion hopefully even increased improvement treatment
eating disorders suffering them. So, hunger
satiety? Satiety, course sated feeling like enough food. want
remind people basic mechanisms brain body communicate.
vitally important, not just discussion, discussion,
think, behave, feel, body communicating two types information
brain regular basis, particular around feeding, two types
information mechanical information, chemical information. mean
mechanical information? Well, take deep breath, oh, hold breath,
find can hold breath lot longer exhale air
hold breath lungs empty. reason not
lungs full, enough oxygen therefore can hold breath.
lungs full, particular class neurons called baroreceptors,
send information brain say, pressure lungs. means
probably oxygen here. trigger breathe actually suppressed,
lungs empty. Even plenty oxygen system,
baroreceptors send different signal brain, no oxygen


breathe. impulse breathe comes earlier. Likewise,
stomach full, sends signals brain purely based mechanical
fullness, nothing nutrients, says full. therefore don't
hungry. Don't motivate find ingest food. Whereas gut empty, even
plenty nutrients plenty body fat stores, tend focus food bit more.
So, volume mechanical influences profound effect think.
consider not doing, likewise chemical effects. ingest food,
so-called blood sugar blood glucose levels go up. information signaled
brain via neuronal pathways hormonal pathways. particular,
neurons within gut, signal areas brain stem involved satiety
sense enough

00:42:00 Neuronal & Hormonal “Accelerators & Brakes” Eating

food system. So, chemical information. So, hunger
feeding satiety regulated way mechanical chemical signaling. have,
have, neurons hypothalamus trigger eating neurons
trigger cessation stopping eating. accelerator eating
break. covered lot detail episode feeding metabolism
hunger. So, want lot detail, see episode, right now, just
going give top contour works. hypothalamus area
forebrain, tells front, base forebrain sits
less roof mouth. hypothalamus contains lots different
kinds neurons, including neurons stimulate sexual activity desire, regulate
body temperature control appetite ceasing eating appetite.
two types neurons within particular area hypothalamus relevant
here. so-called POMC neurons, okay? Pro-opiomelanocortin neurons
tend act break appetite, way another hormone called
melanocytes stimulating hormone. not incidentally getting lot
sunlight viewing lot sunlight, system ramped up.
appetite lower summer months winter months. true
animals. true humans. class neurons called AgRP
neurons. AgRP neurons ones stimulate feeding, create sort
anxiety excitement food, can positive anxiety, can negative


anxiety. mean that? Well, ever seen kids heading get ice cream,
absolutely excited. see people getting raised, sit eat big meal.
excited eat. Sometimes due social factors, increase
overall levels autonomic arousal. depending context, can feel
excited anxious, ramping energy. AgRP neurons
caused that, fact much eliminate kill neurons,
done experimental mouse models laboratory, also humans
lesions neurotoxic effects AgRP neurons. find
don't want eat. essentially become anorexic, meaning don't want
ingest food. no appetite food whatsoever. Now not exactly
anorexia is, AgRP neurons like accelerator wanting eat. Whereas
stimulate AgRP neurons humans say small tumor near
AgRP neurons, become hyperphagic. will eat point bursting,
animals humans elevated levels AgRP neurons anxious.
want eat, will ingest food point override
mechanical chemical signals body. know sounds horrible,
horrible. will eat point burst. Now, signals coming back
body inform brain presence different levels nutrients.
generally comes three sources. First all, body fat. body fat have,
secrete hormone called leptin, L-E-P-T-I-N, leptin body fat, leptin
goes brain suppresses appetite. body brain signaling mechanism
says, look, enough, not incidentally, leptin signaling disrupted people
bulimia obesity certain forms binge eating disorder. So, system
disrupted enough signal enough body fat
don't need eat right here, sort voice body fat, trying talk
brain, signal, dialogue mixed messed up. cases
absent entirely. So, body fat signaling brain much reserve
have. sort like savings account energy, 'cause body fat is.
got lipids lipolysis, can metabolized. interested
process, increase it.

00:46:17 Fat, Leptin & Fertility & Metabolic Dysfunctions Obesity

just generally works. can see episode science fat loss.


body fat something else really interesting relates anorexia,
sufficient levels body fat leptin circulating blood. leptin signal gets
brain, hypothalamus pituitary gland register signal.
completely subconscious way, trigger deployment eggs females
production sperm males. So, body fat stores low, reason
periods shut off sperm production reduced even shut off not
enough leptin getting hypothalamus pituitary. shut off
signals, hormones, things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, hormones. So, don't remember
names don't want travel ovary testes cause ovary
testes ovulate produce sperm. So, reason anorexic stopped
periods, stopped cycling, isn't sufficient leptin
bloodstream. Now attempts give leptin anorexics leptin
sequenced peptide synthesized. can inject leptin
people. studies done that, happens, not
tend alleviate anorexia, not cause people start eating again.
actually makes sense leptin also way shutting off hunger signals
saying, body fats way saying, hey, lot body fat here,
sufficient body fat. doesn't even lot, has, cases
shown rescue menstrual, cycling anorexics, okay? So, body fat
signaling brain. gut signaling brain. neurons gut
primarily responding meaning fire electrical signals.
sufficient fatty acids coming fats ingest, amino acids coming proteins
ingest sugars coming carbohydrates sugars. Things like fructose, glucose,
et cetera. signals sent fat gut brain.
therefore body multiple signals directing toward eating eating
less. So, got two categories neurons. One acts accelerator,
AgRP neuron saying, eat, eat, get excited eat. category
neurons. POMC neurons suppressing hunger. acting like
break, body informing brain time status body
whether not needs food not. So, might ask people
overweight lot body fat, continue eat lot, well past
certain threshold body fat start getting so-called metabolic
disorders, blood glucose metabolism disrupted, leptin signaling disrupted


sorts changes brain side body end things,
hungry, despite fact body plenty energy reserve. Okay,
think sufficient explain basics hunger satiety kind biological
mechanism. important thing again, remember mechanical
chemical signals come fullness absence fullness come
presence glucose blood absence glucose blood.
haven't eaten long time, glucagon levels go up, instance, GLP1 levels go
will drive seek food want food. signals
coming body fat neurons gut. So, lot convergence,
lot pathways. don't offer pathways confuse you. offer
pathways clarify extent something simple eating decision
not eat complicated. perhaps heard, certainly heard that, oh, know,
takes 20 minutes satiety set in, eat slowly won't
realize full 20 minutes. actually not true. don't know
got started, probably chew food better

00:50:30 Overeat

eat slowly, mindful eating, et cetera. So, anticipation
episode, consulted extensively colleague mine Stanford, sadly

Pennsylvania's win. name Dr. Casey Halpern. MD, Medical Doctor
Neurosurgeon, PhD studies binge-eating disorder types eating

not hundreds thousands years, see mice, see humans,
similar types pathways effects. human beings plenty fat

energy, hungry, eat all. seems like just
shouldn't happen. important, think clear intuitive way
framing stuff around eating motivated behaviors can go


awry, not just eating disorders, us. Basically said was,
evolutionary standpoint, makes sense eat often can, much
can, fast can. Well, sounds crazy. told eat not
often, not much, eat slowly chew food. Dr. Halpern pointed out,
circuits brain reward eating often eating fast cramming much
food possible. purely evolutionary standpoint, food
scarce, seeking food dangerous, whether not animal sources
not. always competitive, grew families lot

certain things, typically not competitive food, friends lot

00:55:30 Homeostasis & Reward Systems/Decisions

Dr. Halpern colleagues order try treat things like binge
eating disorder? Well, can frame behavior, good decision making bad
decision-making. pretty simple box diagram model. realized many
listening this, not watching this. no diagram look at. just explain
can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,
one box, okay? eat that. shouldn't eat that. wait dinner.
shouldn't wait dinner. actually another box, okay?
Now true behaviors, say something want say something,
don't, shouldn't say something, anyway. knowledge
kind looping head. homework. go run. shouldn't
right now. shouldn't social media, kinds shoulds
shouldn'ts circulating head. one box. actually
do. behavior, whether not suppress behavior, turn off phone
go read book go sleep whether not stay night, stay
another hour, even five minutes. two boxes two intervening
forces. intervening forces critically important. intervening forces
homeostatic processes, called processes, thing, homeostatic processes,
regulate balance different systems body, hot cold, awake
asleep, dopamine desire pursue things, serotonin desire just relax
chill. So, homeostatic processes reward systems. now move
discussion anorexia, bulimia specifically, see anorexia

Now, don't want abstract here. saying person starves

homeostatic processes, signals body brain say,

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,

rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods

masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel

turn exact points entry changing eliminating rewiring habits,
healthy behaviors. highlight isn't just rewiring
habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal
anorexic. might familiar this. kind uncomfortable around.
Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,
around. notice push food around plate lot. become
masterful actually trying keep people's awareness away doing,
hone low fat, low calorie foods. can't seem set shift.
can't just relax enjoy meal, meal essentially like

otherwise really pleasant circumstance people trying navigate

amazing. frankly also important findings teach anorexics,
happening them, this, able intervene. Now
need support, right? another form therapy seems work well anorexics
ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based
models starting surface lot now various therapy settings, therapy based
models short basically entire family made aware individual's
challenges particular eating disorder disorder. understanding
biology psychology around it, stopped condemning individual.
start support individual queuing towards habits
observe. give autonomy. realize none changes
overnight, taught things like neuroplasticity ability change
one's brain response experience. whole internal support network.


Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia
quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported
therapeutic environment can help people rewire brain, can get relief

many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails

get equal number emails people saying worked self

not passing judgment compounds people sort

clinical trials done people start approaching stuff.
serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff

called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human

beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make

overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-
exercise induced thermogenesis people tend thin, tend bounce

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can

want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode

anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe

conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face

accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind

talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons

major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least

certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making

cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame

called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar

think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing

feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young
adult. So, really polar opposite see anorexia. So, lack
impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper

okay? explode burst say wrong thing, say thing
shouldn't say thing shouldn't do, lack prefrontal control.
indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called
adrenergic, norepinephrine levels brain allow top-down control.
also used treat ADHD attention deficit disorder. tend

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just
pump brakes little bit, no break, right? So, start going faster
faster faster. choice use accelerator just coach it.
essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern
others, think really exciting. even though highly invasive, think going
lead not just relief patients get deep brain stimulation,
also identification sorts receptors present brain areas.
help. means understand brain areas involved
disorder, understand receptors, brain areas express,
can start additional interventions way non invasive treatments, things like
drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral
interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

talking this? particular, talking
episode includes discussion eating disorders? reason is, nobody not

afternoon evening? No. think lot people might've misinterpreted study
don't want happen. pointing fact ingesting sufficient
quality amino acids, including leucine, early day can beneficial maintenance
growth muscle tissue. not say avoid protein later
day. Now intermittent fasters, relevant. I, instance,
somebody long time skipped breakfast, first meal day

dinner might light supper sort, not much protein later
evening. Again, want eat six meals day, want eat round clock.
not going stop you. not telling anybody do. mentioned earlier, nobody
knows exactly eat one's particular goals. study really interesting,
really show can utilize proteins ingested early
day, better can utilize proteins ingested later day.
course will factors can shift that. instance, work hard
resistance training later day, resistance training known increase protein
synthesis. So, stands reason ingesting amino acids training
beneficial. However, study, not seem matter resistance training
fell within 24 hour schedule. morning ingestion early day ingestion amino
acids seemed beneficial. early? hours 5:00 A.M.
10:00 A.M. humans. Now just bit mechanism explain happens. So,
ingesting protein early day lead synthesis
muscle ingesting protein later day? reason turns related
circadian clock mechanism present cells, including muscle cells. So,
muscles fibers. think people aware that, muscles not just
one big blob tissue. lot little fibers contract. Within fibers,
however, cells nuclei. nuclei contained DNA. DNA transcribed
RNA. RNA translated proteins. DNA cells, including muscle
cells strong circadian regulation. one pattern gene expression
different different times 24 hour cycle, unescapable reality
cells body, right hair cells brain cells, retinal cells,
toe feet. cells make gene called, BMAL, BMAL, B-M-A-L
clock gene. expression clock gene varies across 24 hour cycle,
proteins downstream BMAL gene influence protein synthesis.
circadian regulation BMAL gene turns vitally important protein
synthesis mechanism. know that? Well, particular study,
mouse lacked BMAL, gene knocked out, bunch
mice. able explore whether not early day feeding effect present
absent mice lack gene BMAL. indeed absent.
words, effect increased protein synthesis early day eliminated
absence BMAL gene. So, means wake


morning, assuming following standard schedule asleep night
awake day, muscle cells primed incorporate amino acids

P.M., don't weight train all, weight train afterwards before. said five
10:00 P.M. sort critical window increased protein synthesis.
means interested maintaining enhancing muscle tissue volume,
might want consider eating quality, protein amino acids early day,
train first. train after, can not train all. entirely different
discussion. quality protein, well quality protein going protein
includes essential amino acids. particular leucine. Now, lot
debate whether not can get essential amino acids purely
plant based diet whether not need ingest animal-based foods not.
term quality protein no strict scientific definition. people define quality protein
protein high essential amino acid caloric ratio. Now, means
is, small piece chicken steak eggs instance, will many essential amino
acids low caloric content relative say beans plant-based food can also
get essential amino acids, requires calories access essential
amino acids. Now many exceptions nuances. one,
perfectly respectful folks just want ingest plant-based foods order get
high quality protein. think actually can done. One careful
thoughtful choices that. So, really isn't animal based

00:29:00 Anorexia Nervosa (Overview & Myths)

disorders. Now mouthful, no pun intended. major eating
disorders? Anorexia nervosa, commonly referred anorexia perhaps


prevalent dangerous eating disorders. fact, anorexia
dangerous psychiatric disorder all, even depression. probability
death untreated anorexia high, sadly prevalence anorexia
high. So, anorexia prevalent it? Anorexia, look online
talk qualified professional, essentially failure eat enough, maintain
healthy weight. can see sorts troubling symptoms somebody
anorexic period time, general loss muscle mass
ingesting fewer calories burn. Muscle metabolically active. tend
lose lot muscle mass. will low heart rate. body brain's
attempt lower energy output. will low blood pressure. sometimes
symptoms like fainting. will sometimes even hair growth face,
something called lanugo, essentially body's attempt insulate body
loss body heat. thin. Loss bone density, osteoporosis,
loss periods girls women, sorts disrupted gut immune functions.
So, just tons terrible symptoms anorexia really placed anorexic
risky state, mortality anorexia gone untreated extremely
high. Now, one misconceptions anorexia, stems
overemphasis perfectionism, images social media
advertising extremely thin fit muscular people individuals looking
comparing images thinking don't
match developing anorexia, turns not case. look
prevalence rates anorexia, last 10 years 20 years, compare
anorexia first identified, 1600s, perhaps even
earlier, find rates anorexia not going up. So, idea
images bombarded causing anorexia doesn't seem true.
Now, not say images particular young people
bombarded healthy psychological state mind. classically define
anorexia existed essentially prevalence last 100, 200, 300
400 years, incredible really speaks likelihood strong
biological contribution call anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa extremely
common. anywhere one 2% women. typical onset
adolescence close puberty, can show later life well. fact,
identification diagnosis anorexia tends early '20s. look back
history individuals, typically signs anorexia back


early teens. maybe even that. Now, course, men can anorexic
well, anorexia nervosa seem occur 10 times rate women young
girls, men young boys. So, seem
prevalence anorexia boys young men, days, probably due better
diagnosis detection sort societal shift related imagery, et
cetera. Later, will talk body dysmorphia images
present media social media impacting forms eating
disorders. look anorexia nervosa, failure maintain weight, even
healthy levels often drops weight dangerous even deadly,
existed long time, seems somewhat hardwired biology
individuals suffer it.

00:33:44 Bulimia (Overview & Myths)

Now, say hard wired, doesn't mean can't treated cured,
indeed can. Bulimia defined binge eating overeating. Let explain
is. Binge eating consuming vast amounts calories short period
time. Overeating can ingesting calories one needs, extended
period time, can exist course, bulimia also common.
common young girls women young boys men, present
sexes. Bulimia rates bulimia might increasing. sort
interesting finding. not quite clear whether not existed form
long period time within new forms evolving showing up,
going drill bulimia actually represents. one thing
want clear about, just perfectionist mindset associated
anorexia, turns not case. can be, not always associated
anorexia. idea bulimia associated early trauma
childhood, particular sexual trauma. can case, no direct
correlation two. Now, obviously psychological phenomena trauma can
profound impact way brain wires way people
approach food types behaviors. sort classic idea
anorexics perfectionists, want perform well. control
autonomy. bulimics kind dysregulated acting early
sexual trauma, stereotypes psychological framework anorexics


bulimics, doesn't hold up. look data, many, many meta analysis
done. just simply not case. instances, anorexia
bulimia, clear biological underpinnings, driving under-eating
overeating. So, going talk biology eating overeating
appropriate levels eating. that, will start identify
mechanisms serve entry points treatment anorexia bulimia.
probably aware, anorexia bulimia can comorbid,
can exist one another. anorexics will binge purge order
maintain unhealthily low weight. bulimics fit psychological
criteria anorexia. lot overlap two categories. Now
talk categorization second categorization led now
bunch eating disorders defined psychiatric community. One
classic symptoms anorexia loss menstrual cycles, loss periods.
reason body undernourished, body fat stores, send signals
brain inform body undernourished, turn off signals say,
look, enough body fat cells support healthy metabolism.
therefore shut ovulation, literally signal sent fat muscle
brain brain, hypothalamus pituitary will send signals ovaries,
will turn off signals heading ovaries deploy eggs, maturation
eggs follicle, et cetera. So, instances people anorexia
bulimia, still maintaining healthy menstrual cycles

00:37:35 Binge Eating Disorders, EDNOS, OSFEDS, Pica

least menstrual cycles. led whole set categorizations
eating disorders, like binge eating disorder, tends lot overeating,
not purging categorizations anorexia, people feeding,
not losing periods. number different names
acronyms. include things like, EDNOS, EDNOS eating disorder, not
otherwise specified. So, sub categorization OSFEDs. So, OSFEDs
specified feeding eating disorder. So, right now, look online
looking psychiatric psychological textbooks, find
huge constellation eating disorders today. mainly going talk anorexia,
bulimia, binge eating disorder body dysmorphia. can even find eating disorders


like pica, people actually ingest things like dirt rocks metal
genuine appetite things. certainly not recommend sampling
non food items. foods, incredibly dangerous. People often poisoned
themselves. often can cause structural blockages people died
sorts things. nonetheless, aspects brain biology
disrupted can lead bizarre types eating behavior, sometimes pica
caused malnutrition, not always. today going focus
prevalent eating disorders, going build toward understanding
looking healthy metabolism eating satiety hunger looks like.
one, realized not everyone eating disorder. two,
want people understand relationship think, decisions
take eat body brain subconscious levels

00:39:44 Hunger? Satiety?

increase compassion hopefully even increased improvement treatment
eating disorders suffering them. So, hunger
satiety? Satiety, course sated feeling like enough food. want
remind people basic mechanisms brain body communicate.
vitally important, not just discussion, discussion,
think, behave, feel, body communicating two types information
brain regular basis, particular around feeding, two types
information mechanical information, chemical information. mean
mechanical information? Well, take deep breath, oh, hold breath,
find can hold breath lot longer exhale air
hold breath lungs empty. reason not
lungs full, enough oxygen therefore can hold breath.
lungs full, particular class neurons called baroreceptors,
send information brain say, pressure lungs. means
probably oxygen here. trigger breathe actually suppressed,
lungs empty. Even plenty oxygen system,
baroreceptors send different signal brain, no oxygen


breathe. impulse breathe comes earlier. Likewise,
stomach full, sends signals brain purely based mechanical
fullness, nothing nutrients, says full. therefore don't
hungry. Don't motivate find ingest food. Whereas gut empty, even
plenty nutrients plenty body fat stores, tend focus food bit more.
So, volume mechanical influences profound effect think.
consider not doing, likewise chemical effects. ingest food,
so-called blood sugar blood glucose levels go up. information signaled
brain via neuronal pathways hormonal pathways. particular,
neurons within gut, signal areas brain stem involved satiety
sense enough

00:42:00 Neuronal & Hormonal “Accelerators & Brakes” Eating

food system. So, chemical information. So, hunger
feeding satiety regulated way mechanical chemical signaling. have,
have, neurons hypothalamus trigger eating neurons
trigger cessation stopping eating. accelerator eating
break. covered lot detail episode feeding metabolism
hunger. So, want lot detail, see episode, right now, just
going give top contour works. hypothalamus area
forebrain, tells front, base forebrain sits
less roof mouth. hypothalamus contains lots different
kinds neurons, including neurons stimulate sexual activity desire, regulate
body temperature control appetite ceasing eating appetite.
two types neurons within particular area hypothalamus relevant
here. so-called POMC neurons, okay? Pro-opiomelanocortin neurons
tend act break appetite, way another hormone called
melanocytes stimulating hormone. not incidentally getting lot
sunlight viewing lot sunlight, system ramped up.
appetite lower summer months winter months. true
animals. true humans. class neurons called AgRP
neurons. AgRP neurons ones stimulate feeding, create sort
anxiety excitement food, can positive anxiety, can negative


anxiety. mean that? Well, ever seen kids heading get ice cream,
absolutely excited. see people getting raised, sit eat big meal.
excited eat. Sometimes due social factors, increase
overall levels autonomic arousal. depending context, can feel
excited anxious, ramping energy. AgRP neurons
caused that, fact much eliminate kill neurons,
done experimental mouse models laboratory, also humans
lesions neurotoxic effects AgRP neurons. find
don't want eat. essentially become anorexic, meaning don't want
ingest food. no appetite food whatsoever. Now not exactly
anorexia is, AgRP neurons like accelerator wanting eat. Whereas
stimulate AgRP neurons humans say small tumor near
AgRP neurons, become hyperphagic. will eat point bursting,
animals humans elevated levels AgRP neurons anxious.
want eat, will ingest food point override
mechanical chemical signals body. know sounds horrible,
horrible. will eat point burst. Now, signals coming back
body inform brain presence different levels nutrients.
generally comes three sources. First all, body fat. body fat have,
secrete hormone called leptin, L-E-P-T-I-N, leptin body fat, leptin
goes brain suppresses appetite. body brain signaling mechanism
says, look, enough, not incidentally, leptin signaling disrupted people
bulimia obesity certain forms binge eating disorder. So, system
disrupted enough signal enough body fat
don't need eat right here, sort voice body fat, trying talk
brain, signal, dialogue mixed messed up. cases
absent entirely. So, body fat signaling brain much reserve
have. sort like savings account energy, 'cause body fat is.
got lipids lipolysis, can metabolized. interested
process, increase it.

00:46:17 Fat, Leptin & Fertility & Metabolic Dysfunctions Obesity

just generally works. can see episode science fat loss.


body fat something else really interesting relates anorexia,
sufficient levels body fat leptin circulating blood. leptin signal gets
brain, hypothalamus pituitary gland register signal.
completely subconscious way, trigger deployment eggs females
production sperm males. So, body fat stores low, reason
periods shut off sperm production reduced even shut off not
enough leptin getting hypothalamus pituitary. shut off
signals, hormones, things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, hormones. So, don't remember
names don't want travel ovary testes cause ovary
testes ovulate produce sperm. So, reason anorexic stopped
periods, stopped cycling, isn't sufficient leptin
bloodstream. Now attempts give leptin anorexics leptin
sequenced peptide synthesized. can inject leptin
people. studies done that, happens, not
tend alleviate anorexia, not cause people start eating again.
actually makes sense leptin also way shutting off hunger signals
saying, body fats way saying, hey, lot body fat here,
sufficient body fat. doesn't even lot, has, cases
shown rescue menstrual, cycling anorexics, okay? So, body fat
signaling brain. gut signaling brain. neurons gut
primarily responding meaning fire electrical signals.
sufficient fatty acids coming fats ingest, amino acids coming proteins
ingest sugars coming carbohydrates sugars. Things like fructose, glucose,
et cetera. signals sent fat gut brain.
therefore body multiple signals directing toward eating eating
less. So, got two categories neurons. One acts accelerator,
AgRP neuron saying, eat, eat, get excited eat. category
neurons. POMC neurons suppressing hunger. acting like
break, body informing brain time status body
whether not needs food not. So, might ask people
overweight lot body fat, continue eat lot, well past
certain threshold body fat start getting so-called metabolic
disorders, blood glucose metabolism disrupted, leptin signaling disrupted


sorts changes brain side body end things,
hungry, despite fact body plenty energy reserve. Okay,
think sufficient explain basics hunger satiety kind biological
mechanism. important thing again, remember mechanical
chemical signals come fullness absence fullness come
presence glucose blood absence glucose blood.
haven't eaten long time, glucagon levels go up, instance, GLP1 levels go
will drive seek food want food. signals
coming body fat neurons gut. So, lot convergence,
lot pathways. don't offer pathways confuse you. offer
pathways clarify extent something simple eating decision
not eat complicated. perhaps heard, certainly heard that, oh, know,
takes 20 minutes satiety set in, eat slowly won't
realize full 20 minutes. actually not true. don't know
got started, probably chew food better

00:50:30 Overeat

eat slowly, mindful eating, et cetera. So, anticipation
episode, consulted extensively colleague mine Stanford, sadly
us going off University Pennsylvania. So, losses University
Pennsylvania's win. name Dr. Casey Halpern. MD, Medical Doctor
Neurosurgeon, PhD studies binge-eating disorder types eating
disorders arise brain. developed really pioneering
treatments them. talk work little bit later episode,
got discussion body sufficient energy levels desire eat

not hundreds thousands years, see mice, see humans,
similar types pathways effects. human beings plenty fat
reserve plenty glycogen liver, et cetera. words, plenty
energy, hungry, eat all. seems like just
shouldn't happen. important, think clear intuitive way
framing stuff around eating motivated behaviors can go


awry, not just eating disorders, us. Basically said was,
evolutionary standpoint, makes sense eat often can, much
can, fast can. Well, sounds crazy. told eat not
often, not much, eat slowly chew food. Dr. Halpern pointed out,
circuits brain reward eating often eating fast cramming much
food possible. purely evolutionary standpoint, food
scarce, seeking food dangerous, whether not animal sources
not. always competitive, grew families lot
siblings. may resonate you. just one sibling, competitive
certain things, typically not competitive food, friends lot
siblings. really interesting see food served taken
households. like food hit table just absolute war

without compete members species. Every animal,
including humans hardwired circuit born pays attention
much food available, much getting now much likely

two sentences, hypothalamic area called arcuate nucleus.
fascinating area. actually area houses, PMOC neurons

arcuate nucleus start getting active. see food think food, drive

work?

00:55:30 Homeostasis & Reward Systems/Decisions

Dr. Halpern colleagues order try treat things like binge
eating disorder? Well, can frame behavior, good decision making bad
decision-making. pretty simple box diagram model. realized many
listening this, not watching this. no diagram look at. just explain
can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,
one box, okay? eat that. shouldn't eat that. wait dinner.
shouldn't wait dinner. actually another box, okay?
Now true behaviors, say something want say something,
don't, shouldn't say something, anyway. knowledge
kind looping head. homework. go run. shouldn't
right now. shouldn't social media, kinds shoulds
shouldn'ts circulating head. one box. actually
do. behavior, whether not suppress behavior, turn off phone
go read book go sleep whether not stay night, stay
another hour, even five minutes. two boxes two intervening
forces. intervening forces critically important. intervening forces
homeostatic processes, called processes, thing, homeostatic processes,
regulate balance different systems body, hot cold, awake
asleep, dopamine desire pursue things, serotonin desire just relax
chill. So, homeostatic processes reward systems. now move
discussion anorexia, bulimia specifically, see anorexia
bulimia not breaking mindset one shouldn't do.
disruption homeostatic reward processes, decision-making
completely disrupted. many cases not available anorexic bulimic.
Now, don't want abstract here. saying person starves
point might die cases, sadly die. can


know perfectly well behavior leading bad outcomes possibly even
death. yet not able intervene unless get particular clinical help,
homeostatic processes, signals body brain say,
need food. aren't registering way individuals.
bulimic person suffers binge eating disorder. don't
necessarily want eat food. simply cannot help it. like reflex them,
homeostatic processes reward processes associated food,
can't intervene X, Y, Z, shouldn't X, Y,

explanation summarized two sentences. is,
roadmap interventions can really make difference. So, talk
different drug based interventions behavioral interventions social interventions,
like think whether not interventions breaking into, tapping

turns habits. way build break rebuild new habits
one effective treatments anorexia. So, now talk anorexia,
failure consume enough energy, individuals risk death, not
death, severe metabolic disorders, lack bone density, et cetera. mentioned
earlier, anorexia things almost certainly were, anorexia
described early 1600s. maybe even earlier, records
saints, 1400s people refuse ingest food. Another common myth
anorexia sort thing see rich societies. spoiled


children much food decide going focus slim
are, look bathing suits, et cetera, not true. careful analysis medical
epidemiology shown find anorexia even cultures societies
food scarce. So, really speaks biological mechanism. Now hard unveil
societies food scarce, lot people starving hungry,
individuals choose still avoid food seem sort
reward mechanism rewards them, makes feel better don't eat,
despite fact body severely depleted nutrients. So,
interesting points disruption biological mechanism. Now,
want make sure emphasizing not favor people, particular
young children, adolescents, teenagers bombarded unrealistic imagery
bodies. idea cause of, amplifying anorexia, data just
don't seem support that, anorexia classic sense, requires
endocrine, meaning hormonal disruption, menstrual abnormalities, lack sperm
production, low testosterone males, order meet classification anorexia.
mentioned earlier, now nuanced new classifications anorexia
even individuals still menstruate maintain sperm production
anorexia, can still considered clinically diagnosable disorder. Now, typically
anorexia starts adolescence, right around puberty. take look puberty is.
Puberty broad level significant dramatic developmental step.
Anyone goes lifespan. body changes, brain changes,
perceptions, change, one's self perception, changes. changes
driven changes circuitry within hypothalamus. So, neurons

Meaning disruption one major chemical systems brain

reduce chemical essentially eliminate anorexia? answer not really
sort maybe no, why, lot different chemicals brain body,
category chemicals particularly important listened

many categories drugs emphasize serotonergic circuitry, meaning
cause release of, efficiency serotonin brain body. Things like
Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, things variety. drugs used degree

sense, drugs increase serotonin, general effect increase
serotonin, will lower anxiety. sounds like great thing. lot anorexics
really anxious around food. talk why, lowering anxiety might think
lead ingestion food, not often happens, increasing serotonin,
way drug regimen will tend make one less hungry,
heightened levels serotonin blood brain, isn't desire go seek
things will raise serotonin own. Now, anorexics well

studying anorexia anorexia, essentially studying
absence behavior. hard study absence behavior, opposed

pictures different foods, allowing anorexia patients arrange foods,
according preference select, food, nutrient content
caloric content. essentially asked anorexics evaluate food,
so, able identify something unique anorexics level

this. not looking avocado thinking, okay, X number
grams fat rather, looking apple saying, okay, no fat. start

looking things TV screen. Sometimes can press buttons select

reward based decision-making, drive pursue particular food drive
perform particular task, lot throughout day,
controlled brain area called ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Let simplify
little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related
behaviors. So, instance, want get particular grade exam, want
learn something, want complete workout. want go grocery store
pick stuff head home. going think duration. long

store path? way going drive there? way going navigate
grocery store, outcome, able get get items need get


home time, okay? DPO, duration path outcome. conscious process.
tend take account different criteria related preventing
accomplishing want helping assisting you. So,
course, get checkout line grocery store, going select

reward-based, use DPO type processes short term pick groceries
pick line grocery store decide trajectory take home.
use navigating long extended processes life, trying get degree raise

01:24:06 Habit-Reward Circuits Flipped Anorexics: Reward Deprivation

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit
depth. part set circuits involved called go no-go
tasks. don't want go lot detail right now, take us
far rabbit hole neurocircuitry. basically terms behaviors,
DPO type behaviors. So, decision-making, reward based behaviors.
habits learn acquire. just start reflexively, things like
walking, things like yawning tired, things like taking particular route
parking lot, right? learned first time go given parking lot walk


building. that, tend follow exact trajectory becomes
automatized. just like, just without thinking. Well, go no-go circuitry
another aspect behavior, select behaviors perform.
select behaviors suppress. anorexic brain seems reward
suppression one set behaviors, ingestion high calorie foods, reward focus,
even hyper-focus consumption low fat, low calorie foods. So, homeostatic

habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within

involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal

Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,

quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high

explored context MDMA siliciden clinical trials. want
emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails
compounds. People telling amazing experiences
relief various things, not just eating disorders, depression, et cetera. However,
get equal number emails people saying worked self

not passing judgment compounds people sort

clinical trials done people start approaching stuff.
serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff
done regularly too. gotten reports back people so-
called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human

beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,

intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-
exercise induced thermogenesis people tend thin, tend bounce
around lot. kind fidgety burns 1000 calories day, anywhere
800 2000 calories day. Now can beneficial folks
overweight healthy mindset food, trying lose weight.
turns by, literally fidgeting bouncing around, like,
this. looks ridiculous. actually burn lot body fat calories. way provide


caloric deficit, burn body fat body fat not just passive

neat. described several decades now. actually pretty
terrific way burn off calories. So, anorexic, actually want
encourage not constantly trying burn off calories. can
challenging. So, shifting toward activities like weight bearing activities resistance
training promote

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode
depression, talked powerful aspect major depression,
anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe
statements feelings behaviors start reflect lie. not
conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic
suffering sort disorder. just means human
cares appear world. not judge case
anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self
image much don't actually see accurately, visual
perceptions off. reason know this, really important
beautiful studies done colleague, Jeremy Bailenson's lab
Stanford, department communications, actually collaborated Dr.
Halpern mentioned earlier. really interesting studies


give us window perceptual defect anorexics have. actually done one
experiments. fortunate not anorexic, done work
VR lab there. get get adjust avatar
point think it's, accurate possibly be, anorexics, really
distort avatar. words, create serious mismatch
perception reality. So, indeed seem case now
relieving, say encouraging therapies
talked family based model, Connie behavioral treatments. Yes,
drug treatments well. habit intervention model one starts shift
things, appear perception self seems follow
perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning
don't change easily. Whereas appears circuitry related habit
formation, decision-making reward, circuitry, stuff can rewired.
anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need
eat. doesn't seem work. just don't see way
see them. offer point consideration, know someone
anorexic, look anorexic think, still critical
small, even nonexistent amount body fat triceps something?
that? Well, literally brain, relates perceptions, visual perceptions
particular, completely off.

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar
prefrontal cortex. probably know prefrontal cortex ever
wanted to, just episode, prefrontal cortex involved analysis duration
path outcome. Duration path outcome avoid impulsivity.
think. Okay, this, that, that, this, can imagine obsessive
compulsive anorexic, circuits overactive. bulimic
circuit going essentially underactive conditions
think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing
cupboards ordering food. feeling horrible
themselves. tend cycles binge purge followed
feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young
adult. So, really polar opposite see anorexia. So, lack
impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper
limbic hypothalamic circuitry, things sort. Anytime feel like want
say something really offensive don't, top-down control.
prefrontal cortex. Anytime someone says something like grow teeth.
'Cause know shouldn't say anything, gritting teeth top-dow control,
okay? explode burst say wrong thing, say thing
shouldn't say thing shouldn't do, lack prefrontal control.
indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called
adrenergic, norepinephrine levels brain allow top-down control.
also used treat ADHD attention deficit disorder. tend


create hyper-focus. tend push brain into, drugs tend create

think this, that, this, that, anticipating outcomes.
reason, drugs like Wellbutrin, bupropion, antidepressant, mainly
increases amount dopamine norepinephrine less serotonin, can also

psychiatrist order get prescribed prescription drugs,

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just
pump brakes little bit, no break, right? So, start going faster
faster faster. choice use accelerator just coach it.
essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern
others, think really exciting. even though highly invasive, think going
lead not just relief patients get deep brain stimulation,
also identification sorts receptors present brain areas.
help. means understand brain areas involved
disorder, understand receptors, brain areas express,
can start additional interventions way non invasive treatments, things like
drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral
interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can

physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat

think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find

relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating

not going stop you. not telling anybody do. mentioned earlier, nobody
knows exactly eat one's particular goals. study really interesting,
really show can utilize proteins ingested early
day, better can utilize proteins ingested later day.
course will factors can shift that. instance, work hard
resistance training later day, resistance training known increase protein

fell within 24 hour schedule. morning ingestion early day ingestion amino
acids seemed beneficial. early? hours 5:00 A.M.
10:00 A.M. humans. Now just bit mechanism explain happens. So,
ingesting protein early day lead synthesis
muscle ingesting protein later day? reason turns related
circadian clock mechanism present cells, including muscle cells. So,
muscles fibers. think people aware that, muscles not just
one big blob tissue. lot little fibers contract. Within fibers,
however, cells nuclei. nuclei contained DNA. DNA transcribed

means interested maintaining enhancing muscle tissue volume,
might want consider eating quality, protein amino acids early day,

discussion. quality protein, well quality protein going protein
includes essential amino acids. particular leucine. Now, lot
debate whether not can get essential amino acids purely
plant based diet whether not need ingest animal-based foods not.
term quality protein no strict scientific definition. people define quality protein
protein high essential amino acid caloric ratio. Now, means
is, small piece chicken steak eggs instance, will many essential amino

00:26:29 Defining & Diagnosing Eating Disorders



five free travel packs year supply D3 K2. So, talk eating
disorders. that, want emphasize again, nobody can really define
healthy eating is, single protocol. However, general agreement
unhealthy disordered eating is. clear criteria psychiatric
psychological communities define things like anorexia bulimia, binge eating
disorder, will talk about, discussion, want
emphasize self-diagnosis can terrific, also precarious thing.
talked little bit episode depression, always temptation
one learns symptomology given disorder. doesn't really matter
disorder is, ask question. Well, that? so-and-so know
that, ah, see sort behavior pattern thinking. individual,
tempting diagnose either not particular
disorder. However, diagnoses really need carried people trained
particular field, deep expertise recognizing symptomology,
including subtle symptomology eating disorders. So,
symptoms resonate you, way thinking particular
disorder someone that, know, disorder, take seriously,
take information qualified healthcare professional diagnose
rule possible disorders. say not protect us, protect you,
information valuable. believe knowledge knowledge can
valuable navigating topic improving thoughts behaviors around
topic. one doesn't want to, say, one, shouldn't start self-diagnose
simply basis information without running filter qualified
professional. So, eating disorder? Well, take step back,
confess fact every society, every culture, every family, every individual
different relationship food, eating disorders, however, particular criteria
allow us define think different modes treatment. relates
particular symptoms particular, psychological biological symptoms

00:29:00 Anorexia Nervosa (Overview & Myths)

disorders. Now mouthful, no pun intended. major eating
disorders? Anorexia nervosa, commonly referred anorexia perhaps


prevalent dangerous eating disorders. fact, anorexia
dangerous psychiatric disorder all, even depression. probability
death untreated anorexia high, sadly prevalence anorexia
high. So, anorexia prevalent it? Anorexia, look online
talk qualified professional, essentially failure eat enough, maintain
healthy weight. can see sorts troubling symptoms somebody
anorexic period time, general loss muscle mass
ingesting fewer calories burn. Muscle metabolically active. tend
lose lot muscle mass. will low heart rate. body brain's
attempt lower energy output. will low blood pressure. sometimes
symptoms like fainting. will sometimes even hair growth face,
something called lanugo, essentially body's attempt insulate body
loss body heat. thin. Loss bone density, osteoporosis,
loss periods girls women, sorts disrupted gut immune functions.
So, just tons terrible symptoms anorexia really placed anorexic
risky state, mortality anorexia gone untreated extremely
high. Now, one misconceptions anorexia, stems
overemphasis perfectionism, images social media
advertising extremely thin fit muscular people individuals looking
comparing images thinking don't
match developing anorexia, turns not case. look
prevalence rates anorexia, last 10 years 20 years, compare
anorexia first identified, 1600s, perhaps even
earlier, find rates anorexia not going up. So, idea
images bombarded causing anorexia doesn't seem true.
Now, not say images particular young people
bombarded healthy psychological state mind. classically define
anorexia existed essentially prevalence last 100, 200, 300
400 years, incredible really speaks likelihood strong
biological contribution call anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa extremely
common. anywhere one 2% women. typical onset
adolescence close puberty, can show later life well. fact,
identification diagnosis anorexia tends early '20s. look back
history individuals, typically signs anorexia back


early teens. maybe even that. Now, course, men can anorexic
well, anorexia nervosa seem occur 10 times rate women young
girls, men young boys. So, seem
prevalence anorexia boys young men, days, probably due better
diagnosis detection sort societal shift related imagery, et
cetera. Later, will talk body dysmorphia images
present media social media impacting forms eating
disorders. look anorexia nervosa, failure maintain weight, even
healthy levels often drops weight dangerous even deadly,
existed long time, seems somewhat hardwired biology
individuals suffer it.

00:33:44 Bulimia (Overview & Myths)

Now, say hard wired, doesn't mean can't treated cured,
indeed can. Bulimia defined binge eating overeating. Let explain
is. Binge eating consuming vast amounts calories short period
time. Overeating can ingesting calories one needs, extended
period time, can exist course, bulimia also common.
common young girls women young boys men, present
sexes. Bulimia rates bulimia might increasing. sort
interesting finding. not quite clear whether not existed form
long period time within new forms evolving showing up,
going drill bulimia actually represents. one thing
want clear about, just perfectionist mindset associated
anorexia, turns not case. can be, not always associated
anorexia. idea bulimia associated early trauma
childhood, particular sexual trauma. can case, no direct
correlation two. Now, obviously psychological phenomena trauma can
profound impact way brain wires way people
approach food types behaviors. sort classic idea
anorexics perfectionists, want perform well. control
autonomy. bulimics kind dysregulated acting early
sexual trauma, stereotypes psychological framework anorexics


bulimics, doesn't hold up. look data, many, many meta analysis
done. just simply not case. instances, anorexia
bulimia, clear biological underpinnings, driving under-eating
overeating. So, going talk biology eating overeating
appropriate levels eating. that, will start identify
mechanisms serve entry points treatment anorexia bulimia.
probably aware, anorexia bulimia can comorbid,
can exist one another. anorexics will binge purge order
maintain unhealthily low weight. bulimics fit psychological
criteria anorexia. lot overlap two categories. Now
talk categorization second categorization led now
bunch eating disorders defined psychiatric community. One
classic symptoms anorexia loss menstrual cycles, loss periods.
reason body undernourished, body fat stores, send signals
brain inform body undernourished, turn off signals say,
look, enough body fat cells support healthy metabolism.
therefore shut ovulation, literally signal sent fat muscle
brain brain, hypothalamus pituitary will send signals ovaries,
will turn off signals heading ovaries deploy eggs, maturation
eggs follicle, et cetera. So, instances people anorexia
bulimia, still maintaining healthy menstrual cycles

00:37:35 Binge Eating Disorders, EDNOS, OSFEDS, Pica

least menstrual cycles. led whole set categorizations
eating disorders, like binge eating disorder, tends lot overeating,
not purging categorizations anorexia, people feeding,
not losing periods. number different names
acronyms. include things like, EDNOS, EDNOS eating disorder, not
otherwise specified. So, sub categorization OSFEDs. So, OSFEDs
specified feeding eating disorder. So, right now, look online
looking psychiatric psychological textbooks, find
huge constellation eating disorders today. mainly going talk anorexia,
bulimia, binge eating disorder body dysmorphia. can even find eating disorders


like pica, people actually ingest things like dirt rocks metal
genuine appetite things. certainly not recommend sampling
non food items. foods, incredibly dangerous. People often poisoned
themselves. often can cause structural blockages people died
sorts things. nonetheless, aspects brain biology
disrupted can lead bizarre types eating behavior, sometimes pica
caused malnutrition, not always. today going focus
prevalent eating disorders, going build toward understanding
looking healthy metabolism eating satiety hunger looks like.
one, realized not everyone eating disorder. two,
want people understand relationship think, decisions
take eat body brain subconscious levels
driving behaviors healthy otherwise. think can lead
us better understanding healthy eating us,

00:39:44 Hunger? Satiety?

increase compassion hopefully even increased improvement treatment
eating disorders suffering them. So, hunger
satiety? Satiety, course sated feeling like enough food. want
remind people basic mechanisms brain body communicate.
vitally important, not just discussion, discussion,
think, behave, feel, body communicating two types information
brain regular basis, particular around feeding, two types
information mechanical information, chemical information. mean
mechanical information? Well, take deep breath, oh, hold breath,
find can hold breath lot longer exhale air
hold breath lungs empty. reason not
lungs full, enough oxygen therefore can hold breath.
lungs full, particular class neurons called baroreceptors,
send information brain say, pressure lungs. means
probably oxygen here. trigger breathe actually suppressed,
lungs empty. Even plenty oxygen system,
baroreceptors send different signal brain, no oxygen


breathe. impulse breathe comes earlier. Likewise,
stomach full, sends signals brain purely based mechanical
fullness, nothing nutrients, says full. therefore don't
hungry. Don't motivate find ingest food. Whereas gut empty, even
plenty nutrients plenty body fat stores, tend focus food bit more.
So, volume mechanical influences profound effect think.
consider not doing, likewise chemical effects. ingest food,
so-called blood sugar blood glucose levels go up. information signaled
brain via neuronal pathways hormonal pathways. particular,
neurons within gut, signal areas brain stem involved satiety
sense enough

00:42:00 Neuronal & Hormonal “Accelerators & Brakes” Eating

food system. So, chemical information. So, hunger
feeding satiety regulated way mechanical chemical signaling. have,
have, neurons hypothalamus trigger eating neurons
trigger cessation stopping eating. accelerator eating
break. covered lot detail episode feeding metabolism
hunger. So, want lot detail, see episode, right now, just
going give top contour works. hypothalamus area
forebrain, tells front, base forebrain sits
less roof mouth. hypothalamus contains lots different
kinds neurons, including neurons stimulate sexual activity desire, regulate
body temperature control appetite ceasing eating appetite.
two types neurons within particular area hypothalamus relevant
here. so-called POMC neurons, okay? Pro-opiomelanocortin neurons
tend act break appetite, way another hormone called
melanocytes stimulating hormone. not incidentally getting lot
sunlight viewing lot sunlight, system ramped up.
appetite lower summer months winter months. true
animals. true humans. class neurons called AgRP
neurons. AgRP neurons ones stimulate feeding, create sort
anxiety excitement food, can positive anxiety, can negative


anxiety. mean that? Well, ever seen kids heading get ice cream,
absolutely excited. see people getting raised, sit eat big meal.
excited eat. Sometimes due social factors, increase
overall levels autonomic arousal. depending context, can feel
excited anxious, ramping energy. AgRP neurons
caused that, fact much eliminate kill neurons,
done experimental mouse models laboratory, also humans
lesions neurotoxic effects AgRP neurons. find
don't want eat. essentially become anorexic, meaning don't want
ingest food. no appetite food whatsoever. Now not exactly
anorexia is, AgRP neurons like accelerator wanting eat. Whereas
stimulate AgRP neurons humans say small tumor near
AgRP neurons, become hyperphagic. will eat point bursting,
animals humans elevated levels AgRP neurons anxious.
want eat, will ingest food point override
mechanical chemical signals body. know sounds horrible,
horrible. will eat point burst. Now, signals coming back
body inform brain presence different levels nutrients.
generally comes three sources. First all, body fat. body fat have,
secrete hormone called leptin, L-E-P-T-I-N, leptin body fat, leptin
goes brain suppresses appetite. body brain signaling mechanism
says, look, enough, not incidentally, leptin signaling disrupted people
bulimia obesity certain forms binge eating disorder. So, system
disrupted enough signal enough body fat
don't need eat right here, sort voice body fat, trying talk
brain, signal, dialogue mixed messed up. cases
absent entirely. So, body fat signaling brain much reserve
have. sort like savings account energy, 'cause body fat is.
got lipids lipolysis, can metabolized. interested
process, increase it.

00:46:17 Fat, Leptin & Fertility & Metabolic Dysfunctions Obesity

just generally works. can see episode science fat loss.


body fat something else really interesting relates anorexia,
sufficient levels body fat leptin circulating blood. leptin signal gets
brain, hypothalamus pituitary gland register signal.
completely subconscious way, trigger deployment eggs females
production sperm males. So, body fat stores low, reason
periods shut off sperm production reduced even shut off not
enough leptin getting hypothalamus pituitary. shut off
signals, hormones, things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, hormones. So, don't remember
names don't want travel ovary testes cause ovary
testes ovulate produce sperm. So, reason anorexic stopped
periods, stopped cycling, isn't sufficient leptin
bloodstream. Now attempts give leptin anorexics leptin
sequenced peptide synthesized. can inject leptin
people. studies done that, happens, not
tend alleviate anorexia, not cause people start eating again.
actually makes sense leptin also way shutting off hunger signals
saying, body fats way saying, hey, lot body fat here,
sufficient body fat. doesn't even lot, has, cases
shown rescue menstrual, cycling anorexics, okay? So, body fat
signaling brain. gut signaling brain. neurons gut
primarily responding meaning fire electrical signals.
sufficient fatty acids coming fats ingest, amino acids coming proteins
ingest sugars coming carbohydrates sugars. Things like fructose, glucose,
et cetera. signals sent fat gut brain.
therefore body multiple signals directing toward eating eating
less. So, got two categories neurons. One acts accelerator,
AgRP neuron saying, eat, eat, get excited eat. category
neurons. POMC neurons suppressing hunger. acting like
break, body informing brain time status body
whether not needs food not. So, might ask people
overweight lot body fat, continue eat lot, well past
certain threshold body fat start getting so-called metabolic
disorders, blood glucose metabolism disrupted, leptin signaling disrupted


sorts changes brain side body end things,
hungry, despite fact body plenty energy reserve. Okay,
think sufficient explain basics hunger satiety kind biological
mechanism. important thing again, remember mechanical
chemical signals come fullness absence fullness come
presence glucose blood absence glucose blood.
haven't eaten long time, glucagon levels go up, instance, GLP1 levels go
will drive seek food want food. signals
coming body fat neurons gut. So, lot convergence,
lot pathways. don't offer pathways confuse you. offer
pathways clarify extent something simple eating decision
not eat complicated. perhaps heard, certainly heard that, oh, know,
takes 20 minutes satiety set in, eat slowly won't
realize full 20 minutes. actually not true. don't know
got started, probably chew food better

00:50:30 Overeat

eat slowly, mindful eating, et cetera. So, anticipation
episode, consulted extensively colleague mine Stanford, sadly
us going off University Pennsylvania. So, losses University
Pennsylvania's win. name Dr. Casey Halpern. MD, Medical Doctor
Neurosurgeon, PhD studies binge-eating disorder types eating
disorders arise brain. developed really pioneering
treatments them. talk work little bit later episode,
got discussion body sufficient energy levels desire eat
all. not just case binge eating disorder bulimia,
case. know, primitive biology evolved many tens.
not hundreds thousands years, see mice, see humans,
similar types pathways effects. human beings plenty fat
reserve plenty glycogen liver, et cetera. words, plenty
energy, hungry, eat all. seems like just
shouldn't happen. important, think clear intuitive way
framing stuff around eating motivated behaviors can go


awry, not just eating disorders, us. Basically said was,
evolutionary standpoint, makes sense eat often can, much
can, fast can. Well, sounds crazy. told eat not
often, not much, eat slowly chew food. Dr. Halpern pointed out,
circuits brain reward eating often eating fast cramming much
food possible. purely evolutionary standpoint, food
scarce, seeking food dangerous, whether not animal sources
not. always competitive, grew families lot
siblings. may resonate you. just one sibling, competitive
certain things, typically not competitive food, friends lot
siblings. really interesting see food served taken
households. like food hit table just absolute war
portions got much got slightly bigger piece cake, et
cetera, turned frequent happening meals birthday
parties, whereas children perhaps used food presented
without compete members species. Every animal,
including humans hardwired circuit born pays attention
much food available, much getting now much likely
get future. without going rabbit hole arcuate nucleus biology,
two sentences, hypothalamic area called arcuate nucleus.
fascinating area. actually area houses, PMOC neurons
types neurons regulate hunger satiety. neurons
arcuate nucleus start getting active. see food think food, drive
hunger, drive hunger way responsive food looks like,
smells like, also prior history interactions food. takes
account social context, whether not going get whole pizza
whether not going others going
compete with. So, lot signals arcuate nucleus brain
paying attention to. So, Dr. Halpern pointed actually accelerator
increases level awareness anxiety sort constricts field
view senses. Anytime interact food driving primitive reflex
ingest much food can, quickly can, move there,
presumably elsewhere. So, changed way think
eating behavior eating disorders. fact, think eating disorders like


bulimia unmasking mechanism without so-called top-down control,
without mechanisms use regulate behavior. indeed bulimia
binge-eating disorder closely associated impulsivity impulsive
behaviors kinds, something also will discuss more. pathway?
work?

00:55:30 Homeostasis & Reward Systems/Decisions

Dr. Halpern colleagues order try treat things like binge
eating disorder? Well, can frame behavior, good decision making bad
decision-making. pretty simple box diagram model. realized many
listening this, not watching this. no diagram look at. just explain
can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,
one box, okay? eat that. shouldn't eat that. wait dinner.
shouldn't wait dinner. actually another box, okay?
Now true behaviors, say something want say something,
don't, shouldn't say something, anyway. knowledge
kind looping head. homework. go run. shouldn't
right now. shouldn't social media, kinds shoulds
shouldn'ts circulating head. one box. actually
do. behavior, whether not suppress behavior, turn off phone
go read book go sleep whether not stay night, stay
another hour, even five minutes. two boxes two intervening
forces. intervening forces critically important. intervening forces
homeostatic processes, called processes, thing, homeostatic processes,
regulate balance different systems body, hot cold, awake
asleep, dopamine desire pursue things, serotonin desire just relax
chill. So, homeostatic processes reward systems. now move
discussion anorexia, bulimia specifically, see anorexia
bulimia not breaking mindset one shouldn't do.
disruption homeostatic reward processes, decision-making
completely disrupted. many cases not available anorexic bulimic.
Now, don't want abstract here. saying person starves
point might die cases, sadly die. can


know perfectly well behavior leading bad outcomes possibly even
death. yet not able intervene unless get particular clinical help,
homeostatic processes, signals body brain say,
need food. aren't registering way individuals.
bulimic person suffers binge eating disorder. don't
necessarily want eat food. simply cannot help it. like reflex them,
homeostatic processes reward processes associated food,
can't intervene X, Y, Z, shouldn't X, Y,
Z. actual behavior is. Now, isn't just biological mechanistic
explanation summarized two sentences. is,
roadmap interventions can really make difference. So, talk
different drug based interventions behavioral interventions social interventions,
like think whether not interventions breaking into, tapping
box thinking, sort pattern thinking around food, whether not
behavior, actual ingestion restriction food, whether not tapping
homeostatic process, balance energy systems kind getting enough,
not much, tapping reward system. just little teaser
headed, find based data clinical data experiments done
carefully well excellent groups. find anorexics
sort switch flipped, decision-making actually pretty darn
good. might even better terms evaluating food, nutritional content,
habits disrupted. So, not even consciously aware fact
making terrible. cases, dangerous food choices,

00:59:58 Anorexia

turns habits. way build break rebuild new habits
one effective treatments anorexia. So, now talk anorexia,
failure consume enough energy, individuals risk death, not
death, severe metabolic disorders, lack bone density, et cetera. mentioned
earlier, anorexia things almost certainly were, anorexia
described early 1600s. maybe even earlier, records
saints, 1400s people refuse ingest food. Another common myth
anorexia sort thing see rich societies. spoiled


children much food decide going focus slim
are, look bathing suits, et cetera, not true. careful analysis medical
epidemiology shown find anorexia even cultures societies
food scarce. So, really speaks biological mechanism. Now hard unveil
societies food scarce, lot people starving hungry,
individuals choose still avoid food seem sort
reward mechanism rewards them, makes feel better don't eat,
despite fact body severely depleted nutrients. So,
interesting points disruption biological mechanism. Now,
want make sure emphasizing not favor people, particular
young children, adolescents, teenagers bombarded unrealistic imagery
bodies. idea cause of, amplifying anorexia, data just
don't seem support that, anorexia classic sense, requires
endocrine, meaning hormonal disruption, menstrual abnormalities, lack sperm
production, low testosterone males, order meet classification anorexia.
mentioned earlier, now nuanced new classifications anorexia
even individuals still menstruate maintain sperm production
anorexia, can still considered clinically diagnosable disorder. Now, typically
anorexia starts adolescence, right around puberty. take look puberty is.
Puberty broad level significant dramatic developmental step.
Anyone goes lifespan. body changes, brain changes,
perceptions, change, one's self perception, changes. changes
driven changes circuitry within hypothalamus. So, neurons
controlling production so-called sex steroid hormones, things like testosterone,
estrogen, related hormones, prolactin, et cetera. changing
rapid rates. Anorexia tends show around time subset individuals
face seem find food, aversive, now purely psychological theory
fighting autonomy. want control. Puberty also time
children parents tug war control. small child
told go bed sent room. Now child can talk back say,
don't want to, refuse to. happens lot various households, sure
familiar with. Adolescence puberty also girls start menstruating
typically, boys develop deeper voice, start producing sperm, et cetera. So,
lot bodily changes also drive perceptual changes perceptual changes


drive bodily changes. dramatic shift young girl boy doesn't
nourish sufficiently. period, number downstream
negative effects. list them, just subset effects,
hypogonadism. lack sperm production healthy egg production.
amenorrhea, lack menstrual cycling, okay? So, failure

interesting implications sake cholesterol hypothesis anorexics
ingest little food often cosmically high levels cholesterol, including LDL, low

told continue told many sources ingestion dietary cholesterol
drives high levels bodily cholesterol. Cholesterol manufactured liver
anorexics consume little food. often cosmically high levels

hypothesis cholesterol see blood panel due eat.
explanation conditions not sufficient cholesterol

required males females, made cholesterol body,
liver will start generating cholesterol will often overshoot mark dramatic
degree. So, blood lipid profiles anorexics often unhealthy despite
fact eating little food. addition, tend elevated levels
things like vasopressin, hormones regulate body temperature salt

mentioned symptoms earlier. words, huge number
terrible things happening. Thyroid levels down. Heart rates down,
painting bleak

01:06:13 Psychological vs. Biological/Genetic Factors Anorexia



picture indeed bleak picture. So, ask can done
anorexic, right? say failure AgRP neurons stimulate appetite
feeding. say much anxiety around food. say
way food restriction used reward household, right? making up,
can imagine hypothetical scenario just say mother
particular individual vocal avoidance food. seen before,
right? probably seen somebody loves cook prepare food,
sits doesn't seem eat. always seem air quotes eaten
earlier. ate cooked, ate cooked, right? people never
actually see eating, know people like this, anorexic? Possibly, don't
know. child observes kind behavior. Maybe individual always
told beautiful look wonderful fit look, incredible meals

child anorexic. doesn't seem case, least not terms driving
classic, anorexia, really extreme deprivation oneself food. However,
strong genetic component anorexia. So, imagine mild form anorexia
parent supported exacerbated praise, person feels good
praise getting, want low body weight whatever reason,
aesthetic reasons whatever reasons happened appeal them.
child genetic predisposition, right? never think genes terms
controlling behavior, genes, bias, probabilities behavior, okay? So, can
gene depression schizophrenia, not deterministic, way
genes determine eye color, skin color hair color,
okay? So, genetic predisposition there. genetic predisposition
exist one rewarded enough times particular behavior, behavior
can start ratchet neural circuitry, behavior drives neural changes,
called neuroplasticity. imagine child develop full-blown

01:09:44 Chemical Imbalances, Serotonergic Treatments

answers not intuitive all. least surprising.
remiss didn't start obvious, is, chemical defect?
Meaning disruption one major chemical systems brain
makes anorexics anorexic therefore, can replace chemical? can
reduce chemical essentially eliminate anorexia? answer not really
sort maybe no, why, lot different chemicals brain body,
category chemicals particularly important listened
podcast before, even haven't going come
again, category chemicals brain body called
neuromodulators, neuromodulators different neuro-transmitters sense
neuromodulators modulator change activity brain areas neural circuits,
can think microphones held particular sets
connections brain make connections brain, likely
active relative others, okay? make louder speak, many
neuromodulators, ones important sake today's discussion
classic ones, dopamine, acetylcholine, epinephrin serotonin. focus
serotonin. Serotonin neuromodulator tends increase activity certain
neural circuits, including within hypothalamus, also within body trigger
sense satiety, enough, enough food, enough warmth, enough social
connection, enough motivated goal drive type thing behavior
one want of, serotonin tends make circuits quiet down. Now,
many categories drugs emphasize serotonergic circuitry, meaning
cause release of, efficiency serotonin brain body. Things like
Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, things variety. drugs used degree
success. Although not much treat things like anorexia nervosa. make


sense, drugs increase serotonin, general effect increase
serotonin, will lower anxiety. sounds like great thing. lot anorexics
really anxious around food. talk why, lowering anxiety might think
lead ingestion food, not often happens, increasing serotonin,
way drug regimen will tend make one less hungry,
heightened levels serotonin blood brain, isn't desire go seek
things will raise serotonin own. Now, anorexics well
benefit serotonergic drugs, drugs increase activity
circuits leads satiety. think major goal treating

think really beautiful experiments beautiful
explorations potential treatments anorexics. seemed quite high

studying anorexia anorexia, essentially studying
absence behavior. hard study absence behavior, opposed

pictures different foods, allowing anorexia patients arrange foods,
according preference select, food, nutrient content
caloric content. essentially asked anorexics evaluate food,
so, able identify something unique anorexics level
perception food. found anorexics, rather anxious

anorexics hyper acuity, hyper awareness fat content foods, almost
point sort fat content savant. Now don't necessarily know
this. not looking avocado thinking, okay, X number
grams fat rather, looking apple saying, okay, no fat. start

young anorexics kind obsession food, caloric contents,
macronutrient ratios, meaning fat protein carbohydrate ratios. know caloric
numbers, sort pass information memory system brain
allows interactions food, reflexive way actively

reward based decision-making, drive pursue particular food drive
perform particular task, lot throughout day,
controlled brain area called ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Let simplify
little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related
behaviors. So, instance, want get particular grade exam, want
learn something, want complete workout. want go grocery store
pick stuff head home. going think duration. long
have, okay, 45 minutes get store? long take get
store path? way going drive there? way going navigate
grocery store, outcome, able get get items need get


home time, okay? DPO, duration path outcome. conscious process.
tend take account different criteria related preventing
accomplishing want helping assisting you. So,
course, get checkout line grocery store, going select
shortest line instance. So, DPO stuff. requires decision-making
reward-based, use DPO type processes short term pick groceries
pick line grocery store decide trajectory take home.
use navigating long extended processes life, trying get degree raise
children get particularly challenging year, et cetera. So, duration path
outcome, entire process relies fore brain. prefrontal cortex,
prefrontal cortex allows take information memory, combine
information happening present context, direct
behavior, speech, et cetera, toward particular outcomes. sounds like
mouthful, is, metabolically demanding, decision-making metabolically
demanding. takes effort, okay? Reflexes hand, don't involve prefrontal
cortex way, habits reflexes. Like know walk, get
walk, don't think right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot.
just it. doesn't rely prefrontal cortex. subconscious sometimes
called, basically don't use parts brain involved
duration path outcome type analysis. Okay, so, particular study,
examined brain activity anorexics selecting different foods.
mentioned earlier, hyper acuity awareness foods contain

01:24:06 Habit-Reward Circuits Flipped Anorexics: Reward Deprivation

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit
depth. part set circuits involved called go no-go
tasks. don't want go lot detail right now, take us
far rabbit hole neurocircuitry. basically terms behaviors,
DPO type behaviors. So, decision-making, reward based behaviors.
habits learn acquire. just start reflexively, things like

another aspect behavior, select behaviors perform.
select behaviors suppress. anorexic brain seems reward

01:28:30 Break Habit?

going work intervening neural circuitry. related habit

rewire brain circuitry literally causing reflex? case causing
reflex killing individual, least leading bad health outcomes.
way cognitive mechanism teach individual,
leading habit? little bit similar way somebody


suffers addiction starts put different constraint type behaviors, constraint type

turn exact points entry changing eliminating rewiring habits,
healthy behaviors. highlight isn't just rewiring
habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal

Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,

masterful actually trying keep people's awareness away doing,
hone low fat, low calorie foods. can't seem set shift.
can't just relax enjoy meal, meal essentially like

amazing. frankly also important findings teach anorexics,
happening them, this, able intervene. Now
need support, right? another form therapy seems work well anorexics
ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based
models starting surface lot now various therapy settings, therapy based
models short basically entire family made aware individual's
challenges particular eating disorder disorder. understanding
biology psychology around it, stopped condemning individual.
start support individual queuing towards habits
observe. give autonomy. realize none changes
overnight, taught things like neuroplasticity ability change
one's brain response experience. whole internal support network.


Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia
quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported
therapeutic environment can help people rewire brain, can get relief
major depression various forms trauma. now eating disorders also
explored context MDMA siliciden clinical trials. want
emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails
compounds. People telling amazing experiences
relief various things, not just eating disorders, depression, et cetera. However,
get equal number emails people saying worked self

now experiencing chronic visual, snow. getting genuine visual field deficits.
havering ticks never before, chronic insomnia. So,
not passing judgment compounds people sort
thing. just want see clinical data. believe wait
clinical trials done people start approaching stuff.
serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff
done regularly too. gotten reports back people so-
called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human
knowledge knowledge can allow make better decisions. say again,
beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-

neat. described several decades now. actually pretty
terrific way burn off calories. So, anorexic, actually want
encourage not constantly trying burn off calories. can
challenging. So, shifting toward activities like weight bearing activities resistance
training promote

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode
depression, talked powerful aspect major depression,
anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe
statements feelings behaviors start reflect lie. not
conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic
suffering sort disorder. just means human
cares appear world. not judge case
anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self
image much don't actually see accurately, visual
perceptions off. reason know this, really important
beautiful studies done colleague, Jeremy Bailenson's lab
Stanford, department communications, actually collaborated Dr.
Halpern mentioned earlier. really interesting studies


give us window perceptual defect anorexics have. actually done one
experiments. fortunate not anorexic, done work
VR lab there. get get adjust avatar

distort avatar. words, create serious mismatch
perception reality. So, indeed seem case now
relieving, say encouraging therapies
talked family based model, Connie behavioral treatments. Yes,
drug treatments well. habit intervention model one starts shift
things, appear perception self seems follow
perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning
don't change easily. Whereas appears circuitry related habit
formation, decision-making reward, circuitry, stuff can rewired.
anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need
eat. doesn't seem work. just don't see way
see them. offer point consideration, know someone
anorexic, look anorexic think, still critical
small, even nonexistent amount body fat triceps something?
that? Well, literally brain, relates perceptions, visual perceptions
particular, completely off.

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar
prefrontal cortex. probably know prefrontal cortex ever
wanted to, just episode, prefrontal cortex involved analysis duration
path outcome. Duration path outcome avoid impulsivity.
think. Okay, this, that, that, this, can imagine obsessive
compulsive anorexic, circuits overactive. bulimic
circuit going essentially underactive conditions
think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing
cupboards ordering food. feeling horrible
themselves. tend cycles binge purge followed
feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young
adult. So, really polar opposite see anorexia. So, lack
impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper
limbic hypothalamic circuitry, things sort. Anytime feel like want
say something really offensive don't, top-down control.
prefrontal cortex. Anytime someone says something like grow teeth.
'Cause know shouldn't say anything, gritting teeth top-dow control,
okay? explode burst say wrong thing, say thing
shouldn't say thing shouldn't do, lack prefrontal control.
indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called
adrenergic, norepinephrine levels brain allow top-down control.
also used treat ADHD attention deficit disorder. tend


create hyper-focus. tend push brain into, drugs tend create

think this, that, this, that, anticipating outcomes.
reason, drugs like Wellbutrin, bupropion, antidepressant, mainly

psychiatrist order get prescribed prescription drugs,

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just
pump brakes little bit, no break, right? So, start going faster
faster faster. choice use accelerator just coach it.
essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern
others, think really exciting. even though highly invasive, think going
lead not just relief patients get deep brain stimulation,
also identification sorts receptors present brain areas.
help. means understand brain areas involved
disorder, understand receptors, brain areas express,
can start additional interventions way non invasive treatments, things like
drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral
interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat

fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

muscle important. Building muscle might important you,

don't eat red meat. eat chicken fish eggs. don't,
vegans. shown amino acid leucine vital
cell growth process, including muscle growth, relationship so-called
mTOR pathway, mammalian target rapamycin. can talk like
future episode, means somebody wants maintain
increase amount muscle mass have, ingesting high protein meal early
day beneficial that. mean not eat protein
afternoon evening? No. think lot people might've misinterpreted study
don't want happen. pointing fact ingesting sufficient
quality amino acids, including leucine, early day can beneficial maintenance
growth muscle tissue. not say avoid protein later
day. Now intermittent fasters, relevant. I, instance,
somebody long time skipped breakfast, first meal day
early afternoon, mostly protein salad, case, animal protein. 'Cause
alignment values. evening eat pasta, vegetables, et
cetera. might protein, small piece fish chicken something like
that, didn't really emphasize that. basis results. experimenting

protocol, experimenting eating proteins early day eating lunch.
dinner might light supper sort, not much protein later
evening. Again, want eat six meals day, want eat round clock.
not going stop you. not telling anybody do. mentioned earlier, nobody
knows exactly eat one's particular goals. study really interesting,
really show can utilize proteins ingested early
day, better can utilize proteins ingested later day.
course will factors can shift that. instance, work hard
resistance training later day, resistance training known increase protein
synthesis. So, stands reason ingesting amino acids training
beneficial. However, study, not seem matter resistance training
fell within 24 hour schedule. morning ingestion early day ingestion amino
acids seemed beneficial. early? hours 5:00 A.M.
10:00 A.M. humans. Now just bit mechanism explain happens. So,
ingesting protein early day lead synthesis
muscle ingesting protein later day? reason turns related
circadian clock mechanism present cells, including muscle cells. So,
muscles fibers. think people aware that, muscles not just
one big blob tissue. lot little fibers contract. Within fibers,
however, cells nuclei. nuclei contained DNA. DNA transcribed
RNA. RNA translated proteins. DNA cells, including muscle
cells strong circadian regulation. one pattern gene expression
different different times 24 hour cycle, unescapable reality
cells body, right hair cells brain cells, retinal cells,
toe feet. cells make gene called, BMAL, BMAL, B-M-A-L
clock gene. expression clock gene varies across 24 hour cycle,
proteins downstream BMAL gene influence protein synthesis.
circadian regulation BMAL gene turns vitally important protein
synthesis mechanism. know that? Well, particular study,
mouse lacked BMAL, gene knocked out, bunch
mice. able explore whether not early day feeding effect present
absent mice lack gene BMAL. indeed absent.
words, effect increased protein synthesis early day eliminated
absence BMAL gene. So, means wake


morning, assuming following standard schedule asleep night
awake day, muscle cells primed incorporate amino acids
synthesize muscle, regardless whether not weight trained night 8:00
P.M., don't weight train all, weight train afterwards before. said five
10:00 P.M. sort critical window increased protein synthesis.
means interested maintaining enhancing muscle tissue volume,
might want consider eating quality, protein amino acids early day,
train first. train after, can not train all. entirely different
discussion. quality protein, well quality protein going protein
includes essential amino acids. particular leucine. Now, lot
debate whether not can get essential amino acids purely
plant based diet whether not need ingest animal-based foods not.
term quality protein no strict scientific definition. people define quality protein
protein high essential amino acid caloric ratio. Now, means
is, small piece chicken steak eggs instance, will many essential amino
acids low caloric content relative say beans plant-based food can also
get essential amino acids, requires calories access essential
amino acids. Now many exceptions nuances. one,
perfectly respectful folks just want ingest plant-based foods order get
high quality protein. think actually can done. One careful
thoughtful choices that. So, really isn't animal based
versus non-animal based foods. getting quality amino acids early day
whatever foods alignment particular values particular eating

five free travel packs year supply D3 K2. So, talk eating
disorders. that, want emphasize again, nobody can really define
healthy eating is, single protocol. However, general agreement
unhealthy disordered eating is. clear criteria psychiatric
psychological communities define things like anorexia bulimia, binge eating
disorder, will talk about, discussion, want
emphasize self-diagnosis can terrific, also precarious thing.
talked little bit episode depression, always temptation
one learns symptomology given disorder. doesn't really matter
disorder is, ask question. Well, that? so-and-so know
that, ah, see sort behavior pattern thinking. individual,
tempting diagnose either not particular
disorder. However, diagnoses really need carried people trained
particular field, deep expertise recognizing symptomology,
including subtle symptomology eating disorders. So,
symptoms resonate you, way thinking particular
disorder someone that, know, disorder, take seriously,
take information qualified healthcare professional diagnose
rule possible disorders. say not protect us, protect you,
information valuable. believe knowledge knowledge can
valuable navigating topic improving thoughts behaviors around
topic. one doesn't want to, say, one, shouldn't start self-diagnose
simply basis information without running filter qualified
professional. So, eating disorder? Well, take step back,
confess fact every society, every culture, every family, every individual
different relationship food, eating disorders, however, particular criteria
allow us define think different modes treatment. relates
particular symptoms particular, psychological biological symptoms

00:29:00 Anorexia Nervosa (Overview & Myths)

disorders. Now mouthful, no pun intended. major eating
disorders? Anorexia nervosa, commonly referred anorexia perhaps


prevalent dangerous eating disorders. fact, anorexia
dangerous psychiatric disorder all, even depression. probability
death untreated anorexia high, sadly prevalence anorexia
high. So, anorexia prevalent it? Anorexia, look online
talk qualified professional, essentially failure eat enough, maintain
healthy weight. can see sorts troubling symptoms somebody
anorexic period time, general loss muscle mass
ingesting fewer calories burn. Muscle metabolically active. tend
lose lot muscle mass. will low heart rate. body brain's
attempt lower energy output. will low blood pressure. sometimes
symptoms like fainting. will sometimes even hair growth face,
something called lanugo, essentially body's attempt insulate body
loss body heat. thin. Loss bone density, osteoporosis,
loss periods girls women, sorts disrupted gut immune functions.
So, just tons terrible symptoms anorexia really placed anorexic
risky state, mortality anorexia gone untreated extremely
high. Now, one misconceptions anorexia, stems
overemphasis perfectionism, images social media
advertising extremely thin fit muscular people individuals looking
comparing images thinking don't
match developing anorexia, turns not case. look
prevalence rates anorexia, last 10 years 20 years, compare
anorexia first identified, 1600s, perhaps even
earlier, find rates anorexia not going up. So, idea
images bombarded causing anorexia doesn't seem true.
Now, not say images particular young people
bombarded healthy psychological state mind. classically define
anorexia existed essentially prevalence last 100, 200, 300
400 years, incredible really speaks likelihood strong
biological contribution call anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa extremely
common. anywhere one 2% women. typical onset
adolescence close puberty, can show later life well. fact,
identification diagnosis anorexia tends early '20s. look back
history individuals, typically signs anorexia back


early teens. maybe even that. Now, course, men can anorexic
well, anorexia nervosa seem occur 10 times rate women young
girls, men young boys. So, seem
prevalence anorexia boys young men, days, probably due better
diagnosis detection sort societal shift related imagery, et
cetera. Later, will talk body dysmorphia images
present media social media impacting forms eating
disorders. look anorexia nervosa, failure maintain weight, even
healthy levels often drops weight dangerous even deadly,
existed long time, seems somewhat hardwired biology
individuals suffer it.

00:33:44 Bulimia (Overview & Myths)

Now, say hard wired, doesn't mean can't treated cured,
indeed can. Bulimia defined binge eating overeating. Let explain
is. Binge eating consuming vast amounts calories short period
time. Overeating can ingesting calories one needs, extended
period time, can exist course, bulimia also common.
common young girls women young boys men, present
sexes. Bulimia rates bulimia might increasing. sort
interesting finding. not quite clear whether not existed form
long period time within new forms evolving showing up,
going drill bulimia actually represents. one thing
want clear about, just perfectionist mindset associated
anorexia, turns not case. can be, not always associated
anorexia. idea bulimia associated early trauma
childhood, particular sexual trauma. can case, no direct
correlation two. Now, obviously psychological phenomena trauma can
profound impact way brain wires way people
approach food types behaviors. sort classic idea
anorexics perfectionists, want perform well. control
autonomy. bulimics kind dysregulated acting early
sexual trauma, stereotypes psychological framework anorexics


bulimics, doesn't hold up. look data, many, many meta analysis
done. just simply not case. instances, anorexia
bulimia, clear biological underpinnings, driving under-eating
overeating. So, going talk biology eating overeating
appropriate levels eating. that, will start identify
mechanisms serve entry points treatment anorexia bulimia.
probably aware, anorexia bulimia can comorbid,
can exist one another. anorexics will binge purge order
maintain unhealthily low weight. bulimics fit psychological
criteria anorexia. lot overlap two categories. Now
talk categorization second categorization led now
bunch eating disorders defined psychiatric community. One
classic symptoms anorexia loss menstrual cycles, loss periods.
reason body undernourished, body fat stores, send signals
brain inform body undernourished, turn off signals say,
look, enough body fat cells support healthy metabolism.
therefore shut ovulation, literally signal sent fat muscle
brain brain, hypothalamus pituitary will send signals ovaries,
will turn off signals heading ovaries deploy eggs, maturation
eggs follicle, et cetera. So, instances people anorexia
bulimia, still maintaining healthy menstrual cycles

00:37:35 Binge Eating Disorders, EDNOS, OSFEDS, Pica

least menstrual cycles. led whole set categorizations
eating disorders, like binge eating disorder, tends lot overeating,
not purging categorizations anorexia, people feeding,
not losing periods. number different names
acronyms. include things like, EDNOS, EDNOS eating disorder, not
otherwise specified. So, sub categorization OSFEDs. So, OSFEDs
specified feeding eating disorder. So, right now, look online
looking psychiatric psychological textbooks, find
huge constellation eating disorders today. mainly going talk anorexia,
bulimia, binge eating disorder body dysmorphia. can even find eating disorders


like pica, people actually ingest things like dirt rocks metal
genuine appetite things. certainly not recommend sampling
non food items. foods, incredibly dangerous. People often poisoned
themselves. often can cause structural blockages people died
sorts things. nonetheless, aspects brain biology
disrupted can lead bizarre types eating behavior, sometimes pica
caused malnutrition, not always. today going focus
prevalent eating disorders, going build toward understanding
looking healthy metabolism eating satiety hunger looks like.
one, realized not everyone eating disorder. two,
want people understand relationship think, decisions
take eat body brain subconscious levels
driving behaviors healthy otherwise. think can lead
us better understanding healthy eating us,

00:39:44 Hunger? Satiety?

increase compassion hopefully even increased improvement treatment
eating disorders suffering them. So, hunger
satiety? Satiety, course sated feeling like enough food. want
remind people basic mechanisms brain body communicate.
vitally important, not just discussion, discussion,
think, behave, feel, body communicating two types information
brain regular basis, particular around feeding, two types
information mechanical information, chemical information. mean
mechanical information? Well, take deep breath, oh, hold breath,
find can hold breath lot longer exhale air
hold breath lungs empty. reason not
lungs full, enough oxygen therefore can hold breath.
lungs full, particular class neurons called baroreceptors,
send information brain say, pressure lungs. means
probably oxygen here. trigger breathe actually suppressed,
lungs empty. Even plenty oxygen system,
baroreceptors send different signal brain, no oxygen


breathe. impulse breathe comes earlier. Likewise,
stomach full, sends signals brain purely based mechanical
fullness, nothing nutrients, says full. therefore don't
hungry. Don't motivate find ingest food. Whereas gut empty, even
plenty nutrients plenty body fat stores, tend focus food bit more.
So, volume mechanical influences profound effect think.
consider not doing, likewise chemical effects. ingest food,
so-called blood sugar blood glucose levels go up. information signaled
brain via neuronal pathways hormonal pathways. particular,
neurons within gut, signal areas brain stem involved satiety
sense enough

00:42:00 Neuronal & Hormonal “Accelerators & Brakes” Eating

food system. So, chemical information. So, hunger
feeding satiety regulated way mechanical chemical signaling. have,
have, neurons hypothalamus trigger eating neurons
trigger cessation stopping eating. accelerator eating
break. covered lot detail episode feeding metabolism
hunger. So, want lot detail, see episode, right now, just
going give top contour works. hypothalamus area
forebrain, tells front, base forebrain sits
less roof mouth. hypothalamus contains lots different
kinds neurons, including neurons stimulate sexual activity desire, regulate
body temperature control appetite ceasing eating appetite.
two types neurons within particular area hypothalamus relevant
here. so-called POMC neurons, okay? Pro-opiomelanocortin neurons
tend act break appetite, way another hormone called
melanocytes stimulating hormone. not incidentally getting lot
sunlight viewing lot sunlight, system ramped up.
appetite lower summer months winter months. true
animals. true humans. class neurons called AgRP
neurons. AgRP neurons ones stimulate feeding, create sort
anxiety excitement food, can positive anxiety, can negative


anxiety. mean that? Well, ever seen kids heading get ice cream,
absolutely excited. see people getting raised, sit eat big meal.
excited eat. Sometimes due social factors, increase
overall levels autonomic arousal. depending context, can feel
excited anxious, ramping energy. AgRP neurons
caused that, fact much eliminate kill neurons,
done experimental mouse models laboratory, also humans
lesions neurotoxic effects AgRP neurons. find
don't want eat. essentially become anorexic, meaning don't want
ingest food. no appetite food whatsoever. Now not exactly
anorexia is, AgRP neurons like accelerator wanting eat. Whereas
stimulate AgRP neurons humans say small tumor near
AgRP neurons, become hyperphagic. will eat point bursting,
animals humans elevated levels AgRP neurons anxious.
want eat, will ingest food point override
mechanical chemical signals body. know sounds horrible,
horrible. will eat point burst. Now, signals coming back
body inform brain presence different levels nutrients.
generally comes three sources. First all, body fat. body fat have,
secrete hormone called leptin, L-E-P-T-I-N, leptin body fat, leptin
goes brain suppresses appetite. body brain signaling mechanism
says, look, enough, not incidentally, leptin signaling disrupted people
bulimia obesity certain forms binge eating disorder. So, system
disrupted enough signal enough body fat
don't need eat right here, sort voice body fat, trying talk
brain, signal, dialogue mixed messed up. cases
absent entirely. So, body fat signaling brain much reserve
have. sort like savings account energy, 'cause body fat is.
got lipids lipolysis, can metabolized. interested
process, increase it.

00:46:17 Fat, Leptin & Fertility & Metabolic Dysfunctions Obesity

just generally works. can see episode science fat loss.


body fat something else really interesting relates anorexia,
sufficient levels body fat leptin circulating blood. leptin signal gets
brain, hypothalamus pituitary gland register signal.
completely subconscious way, trigger deployment eggs females
production sperm males. So, body fat stores low, reason
periods shut off sperm production reduced even shut off not
enough leptin getting hypothalamus pituitary. shut off
signals, hormones, things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, hormones. So, don't remember
names don't want travel ovary testes cause ovary
testes ovulate produce sperm. So, reason anorexic stopped
periods, stopped cycling, isn't sufficient leptin
bloodstream. Now attempts give leptin anorexics leptin
sequenced peptide synthesized. can inject leptin
people. studies done that, happens, not
tend alleviate anorexia, not cause people start eating again.
actually makes sense leptin also way shutting off hunger signals
saying, body fats way saying, hey, lot body fat here,
sufficient body fat. doesn't even lot, has, cases
shown rescue menstrual, cycling anorexics, okay? So, body fat
signaling brain. gut signaling brain. neurons gut
primarily responding meaning fire electrical signals.
sufficient fatty acids coming fats ingest, amino acids coming proteins
ingest sugars coming carbohydrates sugars. Things like fructose, glucose,
et cetera. signals sent fat gut brain.
therefore body multiple signals directing toward eating eating
less. So, got two categories neurons. One acts accelerator,
AgRP neuron saying, eat, eat, get excited eat. category
neurons. POMC neurons suppressing hunger. acting like
break, body informing brain time status body
whether not needs food not. So, might ask people
overweight lot body fat, continue eat lot, well past
certain threshold body fat start getting so-called metabolic
disorders, blood glucose metabolism disrupted, leptin signaling disrupted


sorts changes brain side body end things,
hungry, despite fact body plenty energy reserve. Okay,
think sufficient explain basics hunger satiety kind biological
mechanism. important thing again, remember mechanical
chemical signals come fullness absence fullness come
presence glucose blood absence glucose blood.
haven't eaten long time, glucagon levels go up, instance, GLP1 levels go
will drive seek food want food. signals
coming body fat neurons gut. So, lot convergence,
lot pathways. don't offer pathways confuse you. offer
pathways clarify extent something simple eating decision
not eat complicated. perhaps heard, certainly heard that, oh, know,
takes 20 minutes satiety set in, eat slowly won't
realize full 20 minutes. actually not true. don't know
got started, probably chew food better

00:50:30 Overeat

eat slowly, mindful eating, et cetera. So, anticipation
episode, consulted extensively colleague mine Stanford, sadly
us going off University Pennsylvania. So, losses University
Pennsylvania's win. name Dr. Casey Halpern. MD, Medical Doctor
Neurosurgeon, PhD studies binge-eating disorder types eating
disorders arise brain. developed really pioneering
treatments them. talk work little bit later episode,
got discussion body sufficient energy levels desire eat
all. not just case binge eating disorder bulimia,
case. know, primitive biology evolved many tens.
not hundreds thousands years, see mice, see humans,
similar types pathways effects. human beings plenty fat
reserve plenty glycogen liver, et cetera. words, plenty
energy, hungry, eat all. seems like just
shouldn't happen. important, think clear intuitive way
framing stuff around eating motivated behaviors can go


awry, not just eating disorders, us. Basically said was,
evolutionary standpoint, makes sense eat often can, much
can, fast can. Well, sounds crazy. told eat not
often, not much, eat slowly chew food. Dr. Halpern pointed out,
circuits brain reward eating often eating fast cramming much
food possible. purely evolutionary standpoint, food
scarce, seeking food dangerous, whether not animal sources
not. always competitive, grew families lot
siblings. may resonate you. just one sibling, competitive
certain things, typically not competitive food, friends lot
siblings. really interesting see food served taken
households. like food hit table just absolute war
portions got much got slightly bigger piece cake, et
cetera, turned frequent happening meals birthday
parties, whereas children perhaps used food presented
without compete members species. Every animal,
including humans hardwired circuit born pays attention
much food available, much getting now much likely
get future. without going rabbit hole arcuate nucleus biology,
two sentences, hypothalamic area called arcuate nucleus.
fascinating area. actually area houses, PMOC neurons
types neurons regulate hunger satiety. neurons
arcuate nucleus start getting active. see food think food, drive
hunger, drive hunger way responsive food looks like,
smells like, also prior history interactions food. takes
account social context, whether not going get whole pizza
whether not going others going
compete with. So, lot signals arcuate nucleus brain
paying attention to. So, Dr. Halpern pointed actually accelerator
increases level awareness anxiety sort constricts field
view senses. Anytime interact food driving primitive reflex
ingest much food can, quickly can, move there,
presumably elsewhere. So, changed way think
eating behavior eating disorders. fact, think eating disorders like


bulimia unmasking mechanism without so-called top-down control,
without mechanisms use regulate behavior. indeed bulimia
binge-eating disorder closely associated impulsivity impulsive
behaviors kinds, something also will discuss more. pathway?
work?

00:55:30 Homeostasis & Reward Systems/Decisions

Dr. Halpern colleagues order try treat things like binge
eating disorder? Well, can frame behavior, good decision making bad
decision-making. pretty simple box diagram model. realized many
listening this, not watching this. no diagram look at. just explain
can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,
one box, okay? eat that. shouldn't eat that. wait dinner.
shouldn't wait dinner. actually another box, okay?
Now true behaviors, say something want say something,
don't, shouldn't say something, anyway. knowledge
kind looping head. homework. go run. shouldn't
right now. shouldn't social media, kinds shoulds
shouldn'ts circulating head. one box. actually
do. behavior, whether not suppress behavior, turn off phone
go read book go sleep whether not stay night, stay
another hour, even five minutes. two boxes two intervening
forces. intervening forces critically important. intervening forces
homeostatic processes, called processes, thing, homeostatic processes,
regulate balance different systems body, hot cold, awake
asleep, dopamine desire pursue things, serotonin desire just relax
chill. So, homeostatic processes reward systems. now move
discussion anorexia, bulimia specifically, see anorexia
bulimia not breaking mindset one shouldn't do.
disruption homeostatic reward processes, decision-making
completely disrupted. many cases not available anorexic bulimic.
Now, don't want abstract here. saying person starves
point might die cases, sadly die. can


know perfectly well behavior leading bad outcomes possibly even
death. yet not able intervene unless get particular clinical help,
homeostatic processes, signals body brain say,
need food. aren't registering way individuals.
bulimic person suffers binge eating disorder. don't
necessarily want eat food. simply cannot help it. like reflex them,
homeostatic processes reward processes associated food,
can't intervene X, Y, Z, shouldn't X, Y,
Z. actual behavior is. Now, isn't just biological mechanistic
explanation summarized two sentences. is,
roadmap interventions can really make difference. So, talk
different drug based interventions behavioral interventions social interventions,
like think whether not interventions breaking into, tapping
box thinking, sort pattern thinking around food, whether not
behavior, actual ingestion restriction food, whether not tapping
homeostatic process, balance energy systems kind getting enough,
not much, tapping reward system. just little teaser
headed, find based data clinical data experiments done
carefully well excellent groups. find anorexics
sort switch flipped, decision-making actually pretty darn
good. might even better terms evaluating food, nutritional content,
habits disrupted. So, not even consciously aware fact
making terrible. cases, dangerous food choices,

00:59:58 Anorexia

turns habits. way build break rebuild new habits
one effective treatments anorexia. So, now talk anorexia,
failure consume enough energy, individuals risk death, not
death, severe metabolic disorders, lack bone density, et cetera. mentioned
earlier, anorexia things almost certainly were, anorexia
described early 1600s. maybe even earlier, records
saints, 1400s people refuse ingest food. Another common myth
anorexia sort thing see rich societies. spoiled


children much food decide going focus slim
are, look bathing suits, et cetera, not true. careful analysis medical
epidemiology shown find anorexia even cultures societies
food scarce. So, really speaks biological mechanism. Now hard unveil
societies food scarce, lot people starving hungry,
individuals choose still avoid food seem sort
reward mechanism rewards them, makes feel better don't eat,
despite fact body severely depleted nutrients. So,
interesting points disruption biological mechanism. Now,
want make sure emphasizing not favor people, particular
young children, adolescents, teenagers bombarded unrealistic imagery
bodies. idea cause of, amplifying anorexia, data just
don't seem support that, anorexia classic sense, requires
endocrine, meaning hormonal disruption, menstrual abnormalities, lack sperm
production, low testosterone males, order meet classification anorexia.
mentioned earlier, now nuanced new classifications anorexia
even individuals still menstruate maintain sperm production
anorexia, can still considered clinically diagnosable disorder. Now, typically
anorexia starts adolescence, right around puberty. take look puberty is.
Puberty broad level significant dramatic developmental step.
Anyone goes lifespan. body changes, brain changes,
perceptions, change, one's self perception, changes. changes
driven changes circuitry within hypothalamus. So, neurons
controlling production so-called sex steroid hormones, things like testosterone,
estrogen, related hormones, prolactin, et cetera. changing
rapid rates. Anorexia tends show around time subset individuals
face seem find food, aversive, now purely psychological theory
fighting autonomy. want control. Puberty also time
children parents tug war control. small child
told go bed sent room. Now child can talk back say,
don't want to, refuse to. happens lot various households, sure
familiar with. Adolescence puberty also girls start menstruating
typically, boys develop deeper voice, start producing sperm, et cetera. So,
lot bodily changes also drive perceptual changes perceptual changes


drive bodily changes. dramatic shift young girl boy doesn't
nourish sufficiently. period, number downstream
negative effects. list them, just subset effects,
hypogonadism. lack sperm production healthy egg production.
amenorrhea, lack menstrual cycling, okay? So, failure

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached

purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,

masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel

turn exact points entry changing eliminating rewiring habits,
healthy behaviors. highlight isn't just rewiring
habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal
anorexic. might familiar this. kind uncomfortable around.
Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,

masterful actually trying keep people's awareness away doing,
hone low fat, low calorie foods. can't seem set shift.
can't just relax enjoy meal, meal essentially like

otherwise really pleasant circumstance people trying navigate

amazing. frankly also important findings teach anorexics,
happening them, this, able intervene. Now
need support, right? another form therapy seems work well anorexics
ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based
models starting surface lot now various therapy settings, therapy based
models short basically entire family made aware individual's
challenges particular eating disorder disorder. understanding
biology psychology around it, stopped condemning individual.
start support individual queuing towards habits
observe. give autonomy. realize none changes
overnight, taught things like neuroplasticity ability change
one's brain response experience. whole internal support network.


Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia
quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported
therapeutic environment can help people rewire brain, can get relief
major depression various forms trauma. now eating disorders also
explored context MDMA siliciden clinical trials. want
emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails
compounds. People telling amazing experiences
relief various things, not just eating disorders, depression, et cetera. However,
get equal number emails people saying worked self

now experiencing chronic visual, snow. getting genuine visual field deficits.
havering ticks never before, chronic insomnia. So,
not passing judgment compounds people sort

clinical trials done people start approaching stuff.
serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff
done regularly too. gotten reports back people so-
called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human
knowledge knowledge can allow make better decisions. say again,
beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining
weight, don't constantly treadmill, no pun intended
balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-
exercise induced thermogenesis people tend thin, tend bounce
around lot. kind fidgety burns 1000 calories day, anywhere
800 2000 calories day. Now can beneficial folks
overweight healthy mindset food, trying lose weight.

neat. described several decades now. actually pretty
terrific way burn off calories. So, anorexic, actually want
encourage not constantly trying burn off calories. can
challenging. So, shifting toward activities like weight bearing activities resistance
training promote

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode

anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe

conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic

anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self

somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning

anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar
prefrontal cortex. probably know prefrontal cortex ever
wanted to, just episode, prefrontal cortex involved analysis duration
path outcome. Duration path outcome avoid impulsivity.
think. Okay, this, that, that, this, can imagine obsessive
compulsive anorexic, circuits overactive. bulimic
circuit going essentially underactive conditions
think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing
cupboards ordering food. feeling horrible
themselves. tend cycles binge purge followed
feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young
adult. So, really polar opposite see anorexia. So, lack
impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper
limbic hypothalamic circuitry, things sort. Anytime feel like want
say something really offensive don't, top-down control.
prefrontal cortex. Anytime someone says something like grow teeth.
'Cause know shouldn't say anything, gritting teeth top-dow control,
okay? explode burst say wrong thing, say thing
shouldn't say thing shouldn't do, lack prefrontal control.
indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called
adrenergic, norepinephrine levels brain allow top-down control.
also used treat ADHD attention deficit disorder. tend

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.

recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just
pump brakes little bit, no break, right? So, start going faster
faster faster. choice use accelerator just coach it.
essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern
others, think really exciting. even though highly invasive, think going
lead not just relief patients get deep brain stimulation,
also identification sorts receptors present brain areas.
help. means understand brain areas involved
disorder, understand receptors, brain areas express,
can start additional interventions way non invasive treatments, things like
drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral
interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

protocol, experimenting eating proteins early day eating lunch.
dinner might light supper sort, not much protein later
evening. Again, want eat six meals day, want eat round clock.
not going stop you. not telling anybody do. mentioned earlier, nobody
knows exactly eat one's particular goals. study really interesting,
really show can utilize proteins ingested early
day, better can utilize proteins ingested later day.
course will factors can shift that. instance, work hard
resistance training later day, resistance training known increase protein
synthesis. So, stands reason ingesting amino acids training
beneficial. However, study, not seem matter resistance training
fell within 24 hour schedule. morning ingestion early day ingestion amino
acids seemed beneficial. early? hours 5:00 A.M.
10:00 A.M. humans. Now just bit mechanism explain happens. So,
ingesting protein early day lead synthesis
muscle ingesting protein later day? reason turns related
circadian clock mechanism present cells, including muscle cells. So,
muscles fibers. think people aware that, muscles not just
one big blob tissue. lot little fibers contract. Within fibers,
however, cells nuclei. nuclei contained DNA. DNA transcribed
RNA. RNA translated proteins. DNA cells, including muscle
cells strong circadian regulation. one pattern gene expression
different different times 24 hour cycle, unescapable reality
cells body, right hair cells brain cells, retinal cells,
toe feet. cells make gene called, BMAL, BMAL, B-M-A-L
clock gene. expression clock gene varies across 24 hour cycle,
proteins downstream BMAL gene influence protein synthesis.
circadian regulation BMAL gene turns vitally important protein
synthesis mechanism. know that? Well, particular study,
mouse lacked BMAL, gene knocked out, bunch
mice. able explore whether not early day feeding effect present
absent mice lack gene BMAL. indeed absent.
words, effect increased protein synthesis early day eliminated
absence BMAL gene. So, means wake


morning, assuming following standard schedule asleep night
awake day, muscle cells primed incorporate amino acids
synthesize muscle, regardless whether not weight trained night 8:00
P.M., don't weight train all, weight train afterwards before. said five
10:00 P.M. sort critical window increased protein synthesis.
means interested maintaining enhancing muscle tissue volume,
might want consider eating quality, protein amino acids early day,
train first. train after, can not train all. entirely different
discussion. quality protein, well quality protein going protein
includes essential amino acids. particular leucine. Now, lot
debate whether not can get essential amino acids purely
plant based diet whether not need ingest animal-based foods not.
term quality protein no strict scientific definition. people define quality protein
protein high essential amino acid caloric ratio. Now, means
is, small piece chicken steak eggs instance, will many essential amino
acids low caloric content relative say beans plant-based food can also
get essential amino acids, requires calories access essential
amino acids. Now many exceptions nuances. one,
perfectly respectful folks just want ingest plant-based foods order get
high quality protein. think actually can done. One careful
thoughtful choices that. So, really isn't animal based

confess fact every society, every culture, every family, every individual
different relationship food, eating disorders, however, particular criteria
allow us define think different modes treatment. relates
particular symptoms particular, psychological biological symptoms

00:29:00 Anorexia Nervosa (Overview & Myths)

disorders. Now mouthful, no pun intended. major eating
disorders? Anorexia nervosa, commonly referred anorexia perhaps


prevalent dangerous eating disorders. fact, anorexia
dangerous psychiatric disorder all, even depression. probability
death untreated anorexia high, sadly prevalence anorexia
high. So, anorexia prevalent it? Anorexia, look online
talk qualified professional, essentially failure eat enough, maintain
healthy weight. can see sorts troubling symptoms somebody
anorexic period time, general loss muscle mass
ingesting fewer calories burn. Muscle metabolically active. tend
lose lot muscle mass. will low heart rate. body brain's
attempt lower energy output. will low blood pressure. sometimes
symptoms like fainting. will sometimes even hair growth face,
something called lanugo, essentially body's attempt insulate body
loss body heat. thin. Loss bone density, osteoporosis,
loss periods girls women, sorts disrupted gut immune functions.
So, just tons terrible symptoms anorexia really placed anorexic
risky state, mortality anorexia gone untreated extremely
high. Now, one misconceptions anorexia, stems
overemphasis perfectionism, images social media
advertising extremely thin fit muscular people individuals looking
comparing images thinking don't
match developing anorexia, turns not case. look
prevalence rates anorexia, last 10 years 20 years, compare
anorexia first identified, 1600s, perhaps even
earlier, find rates anorexia not going up. So, idea
images bombarded causing anorexia doesn't seem true.
Now, not say images particular young people
bombarded healthy psychological state mind. classically define
anorexia existed essentially prevalence last 100, 200, 300
400 years, incredible really speaks likelihood strong
biological contribution call anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa extremely
common. anywhere one 2% women. typical onset
adolescence close puberty, can show later life well. fact,
identification diagnosis anorexia tends early '20s. look back
history individuals, typically signs anorexia back


early teens. maybe even that. Now, course, men can anorexic
well, anorexia nervosa seem occur 10 times rate women young
girls, men young boys. So, seem
prevalence anorexia boys young men, days, probably due better
diagnosis detection sort societal shift related imagery, et
cetera. Later, will talk body dysmorphia images
present media social media impacting forms eating
disorders. look anorexia nervosa, failure maintain weight, even
healthy levels often drops weight dangerous even deadly,
existed long time, seems somewhat hardwired biology
individuals suffer it.

00:33:44 Bulimia (Overview & Myths)

Now, say hard wired, doesn't mean can't treated cured,
indeed can. Bulimia defined binge eating overeating. Let explain
is. Binge eating consuming vast amounts calories short period
time. Overeating can ingesting calories one needs, extended
period time, can exist course, bulimia also common.
common young girls women young boys men, present
sexes. Bulimia rates bulimia might increasing. sort
interesting finding. not quite clear whether not existed form
long period time within new forms evolving showing up,
going drill bulimia actually represents. one thing
want clear about, just perfectionist mindset associated
anorexia, turns not case. can be, not always associated
anorexia. idea bulimia associated early trauma
childhood, particular sexual trauma. can case, no direct
correlation two. Now, obviously psychological phenomena trauma can
profound impact way brain wires way people
approach food types behaviors. sort classic idea
anorexics perfectionists, want perform well. control
autonomy. bulimics kind dysregulated acting early
sexual trauma, stereotypes psychological framework anorexics


bulimics, doesn't hold up. look data, many, many meta analysis
done. just simply not case. instances, anorexia
bulimia, clear biological underpinnings, driving under-eating
overeating. So, going talk biology eating overeating
appropriate levels eating. that, will start identify
mechanisms serve entry points treatment anorexia bulimia.
probably aware, anorexia bulimia can comorbid,
can exist one another. anorexics will binge purge order
maintain unhealthily low weight. bulimics fit psychological
criteria anorexia. lot overlap two categories. Now
talk categorization second categorization led now
bunch eating disorders defined psychiatric community. One
classic symptoms anorexia loss menstrual cycles, loss periods.
reason body undernourished, body fat stores, send signals
brain inform body undernourished, turn off signals say,
look, enough body fat cells support healthy metabolism.
therefore shut ovulation, literally signal sent fat muscle
brain brain, hypothalamus pituitary will send signals ovaries,
will turn off signals heading ovaries deploy eggs, maturation
eggs follicle, et cetera. So, instances people anorexia
bulimia, still maintaining healthy menstrual cycles

00:37:35 Binge Eating Disorders, EDNOS, OSFEDS, Pica

least menstrual cycles. led whole set categorizations
eating disorders, like binge eating disorder, tends lot overeating,
not purging categorizations anorexia, people feeding,
not losing periods. number different names
acronyms. include things like, EDNOS, EDNOS eating disorder, not
otherwise specified. So, sub categorization OSFEDs. So, OSFEDs
specified feeding eating disorder. So, right now, look online
looking psychiatric psychological textbooks, find
huge constellation eating disorders today. mainly going talk anorexia,
bulimia, binge eating disorder body dysmorphia. can even find eating disorders


like pica, people actually ingest things like dirt rocks metal
genuine appetite things. certainly not recommend sampling
non food items. foods, incredibly dangerous. People often poisoned
themselves. often can cause structural blockages people died
sorts things. nonetheless, aspects brain biology
disrupted can lead bizarre types eating behavior, sometimes pica
caused malnutrition, not always. today going focus
prevalent eating disorders, going build toward understanding
looking healthy metabolism eating satiety hunger looks like.
one, realized not everyone eating disorder. two,
want people understand relationship think, decisions
take eat body brain subconscious levels
driving behaviors healthy otherwise. think can lead
us better understanding healthy eating us,

00:39:44 Hunger? Satiety?

increase compassion hopefully even increased improvement treatment
eating disorders suffering them. So, hunger
satiety? Satiety, course sated feeling like enough food. want
remind people basic mechanisms brain body communicate.
vitally important, not just discussion, discussion,
think, behave, feel, body communicating two types information
brain regular basis, particular around feeding, two types
information mechanical information, chemical information. mean
mechanical information? Well, take deep breath, oh, hold breath,
find can hold breath lot longer exhale air
hold breath lungs empty. reason not
lungs full, enough oxygen therefore can hold breath.
lungs full, particular class neurons called baroreceptors,
send information brain say, pressure lungs. means
probably oxygen here. trigger breathe actually suppressed,
lungs empty. Even plenty oxygen system,
baroreceptors send different signal brain, no oxygen


breathe. impulse breathe comes earlier. Likewise,
stomach full, sends signals brain purely based mechanical
fullness, nothing nutrients, says full. therefore don't
hungry. Don't motivate find ingest food. Whereas gut empty, even
plenty nutrients plenty body fat stores, tend focus food bit more.
So, volume mechanical influences profound effect think.
consider not doing, likewise chemical effects. ingest food,
so-called blood sugar blood glucose levels go up. information signaled
brain via neuronal pathways hormonal pathways. particular,
neurons within gut, signal areas brain stem involved satiety
sense enough

00:42:00 Neuronal & Hormonal “Accelerators & Brakes” Eating

food system. So, chemical information. So, hunger
feeding satiety regulated way mechanical chemical signaling. have,
have, neurons hypothalamus trigger eating neurons
trigger cessation stopping eating. accelerator eating
break. covered lot detail episode feeding metabolism
hunger. So, want lot detail, see episode, right now, just
going give top contour works. hypothalamus area
forebrain, tells front, base forebrain sits
less roof mouth. hypothalamus contains lots different
kinds neurons, including neurons stimulate sexual activity desire, regulate
body temperature control appetite ceasing eating appetite.
two types neurons within particular area hypothalamus relevant
here. so-called POMC neurons, okay? Pro-opiomelanocortin neurons
tend act break appetite, way another hormone called
melanocytes stimulating hormone. not incidentally getting lot
sunlight viewing lot sunlight, system ramped up.
appetite lower summer months winter months. true
animals. true humans. class neurons called AgRP
neurons. AgRP neurons ones stimulate feeding, create sort
anxiety excitement food, can positive anxiety, can negative


anxiety. mean that? Well, ever seen kids heading get ice cream,
absolutely excited. see people getting raised, sit eat big meal.
excited eat. Sometimes due social factors, increase
overall levels autonomic arousal. depending context, can feel
excited anxious, ramping energy. AgRP neurons
caused that, fact much eliminate kill neurons,
done experimental mouse models laboratory, also humans
lesions neurotoxic effects AgRP neurons. find
don't want eat. essentially become anorexic, meaning don't want
ingest food. no appetite food whatsoever. Now not exactly
anorexia is, AgRP neurons like accelerator wanting eat. Whereas
stimulate AgRP neurons humans say small tumor near
AgRP neurons, become hyperphagic. will eat point bursting,
animals humans elevated levels AgRP neurons anxious.
want eat, will ingest food point override
mechanical chemical signals body. know sounds horrible,
horrible. will eat point burst. Now, signals coming back
body inform brain presence different levels nutrients.
generally comes three sources. First all, body fat. body fat have,
secrete hormone called leptin, L-E-P-T-I-N, leptin body fat, leptin
goes brain suppresses appetite. body brain signaling mechanism
says, look, enough, not incidentally, leptin signaling disrupted people
bulimia obesity certain forms binge eating disorder. So, system
disrupted enough signal enough body fat
don't need eat right here, sort voice body fat, trying talk
brain, signal, dialogue mixed messed up. cases
absent entirely. So, body fat signaling brain much reserve
have. sort like savings account energy, 'cause body fat is.
got lipids lipolysis, can metabolized. interested
process, increase it.

00:46:17 Fat, Leptin & Fertility & Metabolic Dysfunctions Obesity

just generally works. can see episode science fat loss.


body fat something else really interesting relates anorexia,
sufficient levels body fat leptin circulating blood. leptin signal gets
brain, hypothalamus pituitary gland register signal.
completely subconscious way, trigger deployment eggs females
production sperm males. So, body fat stores low, reason
periods shut off sperm production reduced even shut off not
enough leptin getting hypothalamus pituitary. shut off
signals, hormones, things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, hormones. So, don't remember
names don't want travel ovary testes cause ovary
testes ovulate produce sperm. So, reason anorexic stopped
periods, stopped cycling, isn't sufficient leptin
bloodstream. Now attempts give leptin anorexics leptin
sequenced peptide synthesized. can inject leptin
people. studies done that, happens, not
tend alleviate anorexia, not cause people start eating again.
actually makes sense leptin also way shutting off hunger signals
saying, body fats way saying, hey, lot body fat here,
sufficient body fat. doesn't even lot, has, cases
shown rescue menstrual, cycling anorexics, okay? So, body fat
signaling brain. gut signaling brain. neurons gut
primarily responding meaning fire electrical signals.
sufficient fatty acids coming fats ingest, amino acids coming proteins
ingest sugars coming carbohydrates sugars. Things like fructose, glucose,
et cetera. signals sent fat gut brain.
therefore body multiple signals directing toward eating eating
less. So, got two categories neurons. One acts accelerator,
AgRP neuron saying, eat, eat, get excited eat. category
neurons. POMC neurons suppressing hunger. acting like
break, body informing brain time status body
whether not needs food not. So, might ask people
overweight lot body fat, continue eat lot, well past
certain threshold body fat start getting so-called metabolic
disorders, blood glucose metabolism disrupted, leptin signaling disrupted


sorts changes brain side body end things,
hungry, despite fact body plenty energy reserve. Okay,
think sufficient explain basics hunger satiety kind biological
mechanism. important thing again, remember mechanical
chemical signals come fullness absence fullness come
presence glucose blood absence glucose blood.
haven't eaten long time, glucagon levels go up, instance, GLP1 levels go
will drive seek food want food. signals
coming body fat neurons gut. So, lot convergence,
lot pathways. don't offer pathways confuse you. offer
pathways clarify extent something simple eating decision
not eat complicated. perhaps heard, certainly heard that, oh, know,
takes 20 minutes satiety set in, eat slowly won't
realize full 20 minutes. actually not true. don't know
got started, probably chew food better

00:50:30 Overeat

eat slowly, mindful eating, et cetera. So, anticipation
episode, consulted extensively colleague mine Stanford, sadly
us going off University Pennsylvania. So, losses University
Pennsylvania's win. name Dr. Casey Halpern. MD, Medical Doctor
Neurosurgeon, PhD studies binge-eating disorder types eating
disorders arise brain. developed really pioneering
treatments them. talk work little bit later episode,
got discussion body sufficient energy levels desire eat
all. not just case binge eating disorder bulimia,
case. know, primitive biology evolved many tens.
not hundreds thousands years, see mice, see humans,
similar types pathways effects. human beings plenty fat
reserve plenty glycogen liver, et cetera. words, plenty
energy, hungry, eat all. seems like just
shouldn't happen. important, think clear intuitive way
framing stuff around eating motivated behaviors can go


awry, not just eating disorders, us. Basically said was,
evolutionary standpoint, makes sense eat often can, much
can, fast can. Well, sounds crazy. told eat not
often, not much, eat slowly chew food. Dr. Halpern pointed out,
circuits brain reward eating often eating fast cramming much
food possible. purely evolutionary standpoint, food
scarce, seeking food dangerous, whether not animal sources
not. always competitive, grew families lot
siblings. may resonate you. just one sibling, competitive
certain things, typically not competitive food, friends lot
siblings. really interesting see food served taken
households. like food hit table just absolute war
portions got much got slightly bigger piece cake, et
cetera, turned frequent happening meals birthday
parties, whereas children perhaps used food presented
without compete members species. Every animal,
including humans hardwired circuit born pays attention
much food available, much getting now much likely
get future. without going rabbit hole arcuate nucleus biology,
two sentences, hypothalamic area called arcuate nucleus.
fascinating area. actually area houses, PMOC neurons
types neurons regulate hunger satiety. neurons
arcuate nucleus start getting active. see food think food, drive
hunger, drive hunger way responsive food looks like,
smells like, also prior history interactions food. takes
account social context, whether not going get whole pizza
whether not going others going
compete with. So, lot signals arcuate nucleus brain
paying attention to. So, Dr. Halpern pointed actually accelerator
increases level awareness anxiety sort constricts field
view senses. Anytime interact food driving primitive reflex
ingest much food can, quickly can, move there,

00:55:30 Homeostasis & Reward Systems/Decisions

Dr. Halpern colleagues order try treat things like binge
eating disorder? Well, can frame behavior, good decision making bad
decision-making. pretty simple box diagram model. realized many
listening this, not watching this. no diagram look at. just explain
can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,
one box, okay? eat that. shouldn't eat that. wait dinner.
shouldn't wait dinner. actually another box, okay?
Now true behaviors, say something want say something,
don't, shouldn't say something, anyway. knowledge
kind looping head. homework. go run. shouldn't

go read book go sleep whether not stay night, stay
another hour, even five minutes. two boxes two intervening
forces. intervening forces critically important. intervening forces
homeostatic processes, called processes, thing, homeostatic processes,
regulate balance different systems body, hot cold, awake

anorexia starts adolescence, right around puberty. take look puberty is.
Puberty broad level significant dramatic developmental step.

little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related

01:24:06 Habit-Reward Circuits Flipped Anorexics: Reward Deprivation

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit
depth. part set circuits involved called go no-go

far rabbit hole neurocircuitry. basically terms behaviors,

another aspect behavior, select behaviors perform.
select behaviors suppress. anorexic brain seems reward

turn exact points entry changing eliminating rewiring habits,
healthy behaviors. highlight isn't just rewiring
habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal
anorexic. might familiar this. kind uncomfortable around.
Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,
around. notice push food around plate lot. become
masterful actually trying keep people's awareness away doing,
hone low fat, low calorie foods. can't seem set shift.
can't just relax enjoy meal, meal essentially like
Waldo find face coffee tasked. constantly
monitoring much people observing trying navigate this.
otherwise really pleasant circumstance people trying navigate
remember them, reward avoidance certain things

amazing. frankly also important findings teach anorexics,
happening them, this, able intervene. Now
need support, right? another form therapy seems work well anorexics
ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based
models starting surface lot now various therapy settings, therapy based
models short basically entire family made aware individual's
challenges particular eating disorder disorder. understanding
biology psychology around it, stopped condemning individual.
start support individual queuing towards habits
observe. give autonomy. realize none changes
overnight, taught things like neuroplasticity ability change
one's brain response experience. whole internal support network.


Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia
quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported
therapeutic environment can help people rewire brain, can get relief
major depression various forms trauma. now eating disorders also
explored context MDMA siliciden clinical trials. want
emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails
compounds. People telling amazing experiences
relief various things, not just eating disorders, depression, et cetera. However,
get equal number emails people saying worked self
appointed guide. outside clinical trials referring to,


now experiencing chronic visual, snow. getting genuine visual field deficits.
havering ticks never before, chronic insomnia. So,
not passing judgment compounds people sort
thing. just want see clinical data. believe wait
clinical trials done people start approaching stuff.
serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff
done regularly too. gotten reports back people so-
called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human
knowledge knowledge can allow make better decisions. say again,
beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining
weight, don't constantly treadmill, no pun intended
balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-
exercise induced thermogenesis people tend thin, tend bounce
around lot. kind fidgety burns 1000 calories day, anywhere
800 2000 calories day. Now can beneficial folks
overweight healthy mindset food, trying lose weight.
turns by, literally fidgeting bouncing around, like,
this. looks ridiculous. actually burn lot body fat calories. way provide


caloric deficit, burn body fat body fat not just passive

neat. described several decades now. actually pretty
terrific way burn off calories. So, anorexic, actually want
encourage not constantly trying burn off calories. can
challenging. So, shifting toward activities like weight bearing activities resistance
training promote

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode
depression, talked powerful aspect major depression,
anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe
statements feelings behaviors start reflect lie. not
conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic
suffering sort disorder. just means human
cares appear world. not judge case
anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self
image much don't actually see accurately, visual

beautiful studies done colleague, Jeremy Bailenson's lab
Stanford, department communications, actually collaborated Dr.
Halpern mentioned earlier. really interesting studies


give us window perceptual defect anorexics have. actually done one

relieving, say encouraging therapies
talked family based model, Connie behavioral treatments. Yes,
drug treatments well. habit intervention model one starts shift
things, appear perception self seems follow
perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning
don't change easily. Whereas appears circuitry related habit
formation, decision-making reward, circuitry, stuff can rewired.
anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need
eat. doesn't seem work. just don't see way
see them. offer point consideration, know someone
anorexic, look anorexic think, still critical
small, even nonexistent amount body fat triceps something?
that? Well, literally brain, relates perceptions, visual perceptions

bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat

think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons

major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar
prefrontal cortex. probably know prefrontal cortex ever
wanted to, just episode, prefrontal cortex involved analysis duration
path outcome. Duration path outcome avoid impulsivity.
think. Okay, this, that, that, this, can imagine obsessive
compulsive anorexic, circuits overactive. bulimic
circuit going essentially underactive conditions
think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing
cupboards ordering food. feeling horrible
themselves. tend cycles binge purge followed
feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young
adult. So, really polar opposite see anorexia. So, lack
impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper
limbic hypothalamic circuitry, things sort. Anytime feel like want
say something really offensive don't, top-down control.
prefrontal cortex. Anytime someone says something like grow teeth.
'Cause know shouldn't say anything, gritting teeth top-dow control,
okay? explode burst say wrong thing, say thing
shouldn't say thing shouldn't do, lack prefrontal control.
indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called
adrenergic, norepinephrine levels brain allow top-down control.
also used treat ADHD attention deficit disorder. tend

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just
pump brakes little bit, no break, right? So, start going faster
faster faster. choice use accelerator just coach it.
essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern
others, think really exciting. even though highly invasive, think going
lead not just relief patients get deep brain stimulation,
also identification sorts receptors present brain areas.
help. means understand brain areas involved
disorder, understand receptors, brain areas express,
can start additional interventions way non invasive treatments, things like
drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral
interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

00:29:00 Anorexia Nervosa (Overview & Myths)

disorders. Now mouthful, no pun intended. major eating
disorders? Anorexia nervosa, commonly referred anorexia perhaps


prevalent dangerous eating disorders. fact, anorexia
dangerous psychiatric disorder all, even depression. probability
death untreated anorexia high, sadly prevalence anorexia
high. So, anorexia prevalent it? Anorexia, look online
talk qualified professional, essentially failure eat enough, maintain
healthy weight. can see sorts troubling symptoms somebody
anorexic period time, general loss muscle mass
ingesting fewer calories burn. Muscle metabolically active. tend
lose lot muscle mass. will low heart rate. body brain's
attempt lower energy output. will low blood pressure. sometimes
symptoms like fainting. will sometimes even hair growth face,
something called lanugo, essentially body's attempt insulate body
loss body heat. thin. Loss bone density, osteoporosis,
loss periods girls women, sorts disrupted gut immune functions.
So, just tons terrible symptoms anorexia really placed anorexic
risky state, mortality anorexia gone untreated extremely
high. Now, one misconceptions anorexia, stems
overemphasis perfectionism, images social media
advertising extremely thin fit muscular people individuals looking
comparing images thinking don't
match developing anorexia, turns not case. look
prevalence rates anorexia, last 10 years 20 years, compare
anorexia first identified, 1600s, perhaps even
earlier, find rates anorexia not going up. So, idea
images bombarded causing anorexia doesn't seem true.
Now, not say images particular young people
bombarded healthy psychological state mind. classically define
anorexia existed essentially prevalence last 100, 200, 300
400 years, incredible really speaks likelihood strong
biological contribution call anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa extremely
common. anywhere one 2% women. typical onset
adolescence close puberty, can show later life well. fact,
identification diagnosis anorexia tends early '20s. look back
history individuals, typically signs anorexia back


early teens. maybe even that. Now, course, men can anorexic
well, anorexia nervosa seem occur 10 times rate women young
girls, men young boys. So, seem
prevalence anorexia boys young men, days, probably due better
diagnosis detection sort societal shift related imagery, et
cetera. Later, will talk body dysmorphia images
present media social media impacting forms eating
disorders. look anorexia nervosa, failure maintain weight, even
healthy levels often drops weight dangerous even deadly,
existed long time, seems somewhat hardwired biology
individuals suffer it.

00:33:44 Bulimia (Overview & Myths)

Now, say hard wired, doesn't mean can't treated cured,
indeed can. Bulimia defined binge eating overeating. Let explain
is. Binge eating consuming vast amounts calories short period
time. Overeating can ingesting calories one needs, extended
period time, can exist course, bulimia also common.
common young girls women young boys men, present
sexes. Bulimia rates bulimia might increasing. sort
interesting finding. not quite clear whether not existed form
long period time within new forms evolving showing up,
going drill bulimia actually represents. one thing
want clear about, just perfectionist mindset associated
anorexia, turns not case. can be, not always associated
anorexia. idea bulimia associated early trauma
childhood, particular sexual trauma. can case, no direct
correlation two. Now, obviously psychological phenomena trauma can
profound impact way brain wires way people
approach food types behaviors. sort classic idea
anorexics perfectionists, want perform well. control
autonomy. bulimics kind dysregulated acting early
sexual trauma, stereotypes psychological framework anorexics


bulimics, doesn't hold up. look data, many, many meta analysis
done. just simply not case. instances, anorexia
bulimia, clear biological underpinnings, driving under-eating
overeating. So, going talk biology eating overeating
appropriate levels eating. that, will start identify
mechanisms serve entry points treatment anorexia bulimia.
probably aware, anorexia bulimia can comorbid,
can exist one another. anorexics will binge purge order
maintain unhealthily low weight. bulimics fit psychological
criteria anorexia. lot overlap two categories. Now
talk categorization second categorization led now
bunch eating disorders defined psychiatric community. One
classic symptoms anorexia loss menstrual cycles, loss periods.
reason body undernourished, body fat stores, send signals
brain inform body undernourished, turn off signals say,
look, enough body fat cells support healthy metabolism.
therefore shut ovulation, literally signal sent fat muscle
brain brain, hypothalamus pituitary will send signals ovaries,
will turn off signals heading ovaries deploy eggs, maturation
eggs follicle, et cetera. So, instances people anorexia
bulimia, still maintaining healthy menstrual cycles

00:37:35 Binge Eating Disorders, EDNOS, OSFEDS, Pica

least menstrual cycles. led whole set categorizations
eating disorders, like binge eating disorder, tends lot overeating,
not purging categorizations anorexia, people feeding,
not losing periods. number different names
acronyms. include things like, EDNOS, EDNOS eating disorder, not
otherwise specified. So, sub categorization OSFEDs. So, OSFEDs
specified feeding eating disorder. So, right now, look online
looking psychiatric psychological textbooks, find
huge constellation eating disorders today. mainly going talk anorexia,
bulimia, binge eating disorder body dysmorphia. can even find eating disorders


like pica, people actually ingest things like dirt rocks metal
genuine appetite things. certainly not recommend sampling
non food items. foods, incredibly dangerous. People often poisoned
themselves. often can cause structural blockages people died
sorts things. nonetheless, aspects brain biology
disrupted can lead bizarre types eating behavior, sometimes pica
caused malnutrition, not always. today going focus
prevalent eating disorders, going build toward understanding
looking healthy metabolism eating satiety hunger looks like.
one, realized not everyone eating disorder. two,
want people understand relationship think, decisions
take eat body brain subconscious levels
driving behaviors healthy otherwise. think can lead
us better understanding healthy eating us,

00:39:44 Hunger? Satiety?

increase compassion hopefully even increased improvement treatment
eating disorders suffering them. So, hunger
satiety? Satiety, course sated feeling like enough food. want
remind people basic mechanisms brain body communicate.
vitally important, not just discussion, discussion,
think, behave, feel, body communicating two types information
brain regular basis, particular around feeding, two types
information mechanical information, chemical information. mean
mechanical information? Well, take deep breath, oh, hold breath,
find can hold breath lot longer exhale air
hold breath lungs empty. reason not
lungs full, enough oxygen therefore can hold breath.
lungs full, particular class neurons called baroreceptors,
send information brain say, pressure lungs. means
probably oxygen here. trigger breathe actually suppressed,
lungs empty. Even plenty oxygen system,
baroreceptors send different signal brain, no oxygen


breathe. impulse breathe comes earlier. Likewise,
stomach full, sends signals brain purely based mechanical
fullness, nothing nutrients, says full. therefore don't
hungry. Don't motivate find ingest food. Whereas gut empty, even
plenty nutrients plenty body fat stores, tend focus food bit more.
So, volume mechanical influences profound effect think.
consider not doing, likewise chemical effects. ingest food,
so-called blood sugar blood glucose levels go up. information signaled
brain via neuronal pathways hormonal pathways. particular,
neurons within gut, signal areas brain stem involved satiety
sense enough

00:42:00 Neuronal & Hormonal “Accelerators & Brakes” Eating

food system. So, chemical information. So, hunger
feeding satiety regulated way mechanical chemical signaling. have,
have, neurons hypothalamus trigger eating neurons
trigger cessation stopping eating. accelerator eating
break. covered lot detail episode feeding metabolism
hunger. So, want lot detail, see episode, right now, just
going give top contour works. hypothalamus area
forebrain, tells front, base forebrain sits
less roof mouth. hypothalamus contains lots different
kinds neurons, including neurons stimulate sexual activity desire, regulate
body temperature control appetite ceasing eating appetite.
two types neurons within particular area hypothalamus relevant
here. so-called POMC neurons, okay? Pro-opiomelanocortin neurons
tend act break appetite, way another hormone called
melanocytes stimulating hormone. not incidentally getting lot
sunlight viewing lot sunlight, system ramped up.
appetite lower summer months winter months. true
animals. true humans. class neurons called AgRP
neurons. AgRP neurons ones stimulate feeding, create sort
anxiety excitement food, can positive anxiety, can negative


anxiety. mean that? Well, ever seen kids heading get ice cream,
absolutely excited. see people getting raised, sit eat big meal.
excited eat. Sometimes due social factors, increase
overall levels autonomic arousal. depending context, can feel
excited anxious, ramping energy. AgRP neurons
caused that, fact much eliminate kill neurons,
done experimental mouse models laboratory, also humans
lesions neurotoxic effects AgRP neurons. find
don't want eat. essentially become anorexic, meaning don't want
ingest food. no appetite food whatsoever. Now not exactly
anorexia is, AgRP neurons like accelerator wanting eat. Whereas
stimulate AgRP neurons humans say small tumor near
AgRP neurons, become hyperphagic. will eat point bursting,
animals humans elevated levels AgRP neurons anxious.
want eat, will ingest food point override
mechanical chemical signals body. know sounds horrible,
horrible. will eat point burst. Now, signals coming back
body inform brain presence different levels nutrients.
generally comes three sources. First all, body fat. body fat have,
secrete hormone called leptin, L-E-P-T-I-N, leptin body fat, leptin
goes brain suppresses appetite. body brain signaling mechanism
says, look, enough, not incidentally, leptin signaling disrupted people
bulimia obesity certain forms binge eating disorder. So, system
disrupted enough signal enough body fat
don't need eat right here, sort voice body fat, trying talk
brain, signal, dialogue mixed messed up. cases
absent entirely. So, body fat signaling brain much reserve
have. sort like savings account energy, 'cause body fat is.
got lipids lipolysis, can metabolized. interested
process, increase it.

00:46:17 Fat, Leptin & Fertility & Metabolic Dysfunctions Obesity

just generally works. can see episode science fat loss.


body fat something else really interesting relates anorexia,
sufficient levels body fat leptin circulating blood. leptin signal gets
brain, hypothalamus pituitary gland register signal.
completely subconscious way, trigger deployment eggs females
production sperm males. So, body fat stores low, reason
periods shut off sperm production reduced even shut off not
enough leptin getting hypothalamus pituitary. shut off
signals, hormones, things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, hormones. So, don't remember
names don't want travel ovary testes cause ovary
testes ovulate produce sperm. So, reason anorexic stopped
periods, stopped cycling, isn't sufficient leptin

therefore body multiple signals directing toward eating eating

00:55:30 Homeostasis & Reward Systems/Decisions

Dr. Halpern colleagues order try treat things like binge
eating disorder? Well, can frame behavior, good decision making bad
decision-making. pretty simple box diagram model. realized many
listening this, not watching this. no diagram look at. just explain
can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,
one box, okay? eat that. shouldn't eat that. wait dinner.
shouldn't wait dinner. actually another box, okay?
Now true behaviors, say something want say something,
don't, shouldn't say something, anyway. knowledge
kind looping head. homework. go run. shouldn't
right now. shouldn't social media, kinds shoulds
shouldn'ts circulating head. one box. actually
do. behavior, whether not suppress behavior, turn off phone
go read book go sleep whether not stay night, stay
another hour, even five minutes. two boxes two intervening
forces. intervening forces critically important. intervening forces
homeostatic processes, called processes, thing, homeostatic processes,
regulate balance different systems body, hot cold, awake

even individuals still menstruate maintain sperm production
anorexia, can still considered clinically diagnosable disorder. Now, typically
anorexia starts adolescence, right around puberty. take look puberty is.
Puberty broad level significant dramatic developmental step.
Anyone goes lifespan. body changes, brain changes,

little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related

brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,

rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel

feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit

habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within

involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal

Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom

Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing

sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical

pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just

want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode
depression, talked powerful aspect major depression,
anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe
statements feelings behaviors start reflect lie. not
conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic
suffering sort disorder. just means human
cares appear world. not judge case
anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self
image much don't actually see accurately, visual

beautiful studies done colleague, Jeremy Bailenson's lab
Stanford, department communications, actually collaborated Dr.
Halpern mentioned earlier. really interesting studies


give us window perceptual defect anorexics have. actually done one
experiments. fortunate not anorexic, done work
VR lab there. get get adjust avatar
point think it's, accurate possibly be, anorexics, really
distort avatar. words, create serious mismatch
perception reality. So, indeed seem case now
relieving, say encouraging therapies
talked family based model, Connie behavioral treatments. Yes,
drug treatments well. habit intervention model one starts shift
things, appear perception self seems follow
perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning
don't change easily. Whereas appears circuitry related habit
formation, decision-making reward, circuitry, stuff can rewired.
anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need
eat. doesn't seem work. just don't see way
see them. offer point consideration, know someone
anorexic, look anorexic think, still critical
small, even nonexistent amount body fat triceps something?
that? Well, literally brain, relates perceptions, visual perceptions
particular, completely off.

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit

common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar

think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing

feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young

impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper

indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food

people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel

this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can

meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat

think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find

question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating

00:29:00 Anorexia Nervosa (Overview & Myths)

disorders. Now mouthful, no pun intended. major eating
disorders? Anorexia nervosa, commonly referred anorexia perhaps


prevalent dangerous eating disorders. fact, anorexia
dangerous psychiatric disorder all, even depression. probability
death untreated anorexia high, sadly prevalence anorexia
high. So, anorexia prevalent it? Anorexia, look online
talk qualified professional, essentially failure eat enough, maintain
healthy weight. can see sorts troubling symptoms somebody
anorexic period time, general loss muscle mass
ingesting fewer calories burn. Muscle metabolically active. tend
lose lot muscle mass. will low heart rate. body brain's
attempt lower energy output. will low blood pressure. sometimes
symptoms like fainting. will sometimes even hair growth face,
something called lanugo, essentially body's attempt insulate body
loss body heat. thin. Loss bone density, osteoporosis,
loss periods girls women, sorts disrupted gut immune functions.
So, just tons terrible symptoms anorexia really placed anorexic
risky state, mortality anorexia gone untreated extremely
high. Now, one misconceptions anorexia, stems
overemphasis perfectionism, images social media
advertising extremely thin fit muscular people individuals looking
comparing images thinking don't
match developing anorexia, turns not case. look
prevalence rates anorexia, last 10 years 20 years, compare
anorexia first identified, 1600s, perhaps even
earlier, find rates anorexia not going up. So, idea
images bombarded causing anorexia doesn't seem true.
Now, not say images particular young people
bombarded healthy psychological state mind. classically define
anorexia existed essentially prevalence last 100, 200, 300
400 years, incredible really speaks likelihood strong
biological contribution call anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa extremely
common. anywhere one 2% women. typical onset
adolescence close puberty, can show later life well. fact,
identification diagnosis anorexia tends early '20s. look back
history individuals, typically signs anorexia back


early teens. maybe even that. Now, course, men can anorexic
well, anorexia nervosa seem occur 10 times rate women young
girls, men young boys. So, seem
prevalence anorexia boys young men, days, probably due better
diagnosis detection sort societal shift related imagery, et
cetera. Later, will talk body dysmorphia images
present media social media impacting forms eating
disorders. look anorexia nervosa, failure maintain weight, even
healthy levels often drops weight dangerous even deadly,
existed long time, seems somewhat hardwired biology
individuals suffer it.

00:33:44 Bulimia (Overview & Myths)

Now, say hard wired, doesn't mean can't treated cured,
indeed can. Bulimia defined binge eating overeating. Let explain
is. Binge eating consuming vast amounts calories short period
time. Overeating can ingesting calories one needs, extended
period time, can exist course, bulimia also common.
common young girls women young boys men, present
sexes. Bulimia rates bulimia might increasing. sort
interesting finding. not quite clear whether not existed form
long period time within new forms evolving showing up,
going drill bulimia actually represents. one thing
want clear about, just perfectionist mindset associated
anorexia, turns not case. can be, not always associated
anorexia. idea bulimia associated early trauma
childhood, particular sexual trauma. can case, no direct
correlation two. Now, obviously psychological phenomena trauma can
profound impact way brain wires way people
approach food types behaviors. sort classic idea
anorexics perfectionists, want perform well. control
autonomy. bulimics kind dysregulated acting early
sexual trauma, stereotypes psychological framework anorexics


bulimics, doesn't hold up. look data, many, many meta analysis
done. just simply not case. instances, anorexia
bulimia, clear biological underpinnings, driving under-eating
overeating. So, going talk biology eating overeating
appropriate levels eating. that, will start identify
mechanisms serve entry points treatment anorexia bulimia.
probably aware, anorexia bulimia can comorbid,
can exist one another. anorexics will binge purge order
maintain unhealthily low weight. bulimics fit psychological
criteria anorexia. lot overlap two categories. Now
talk categorization second categorization led now
bunch eating disorders defined psychiatric community. One
classic symptoms anorexia loss menstrual cycles, loss periods.
reason body undernourished, body fat stores, send signals
brain inform body undernourished, turn off signals say,
look, enough body fat cells support healthy metabolism.
therefore shut ovulation, literally signal sent fat muscle
brain brain, hypothalamus pituitary will send signals ovaries,
will turn off signals heading ovaries deploy eggs, maturation
eggs follicle, et cetera. So, instances people anorexia
bulimia, still maintaining healthy menstrual cycles

00:37:35 Binge Eating Disorders, EDNOS, OSFEDS, Pica

least menstrual cycles. led whole set categorizations
eating disorders, like binge eating disorder, tends lot overeating,
not purging categorizations anorexia, people feeding,
not losing periods. number different names
acronyms. include things like, EDNOS, EDNOS eating disorder, not
otherwise specified. So, sub categorization OSFEDs. So, OSFEDs
specified feeding eating disorder. So, right now, look online
looking psychiatric psychological textbooks, find
huge constellation eating disorders today. mainly going talk anorexia,
bulimia, binge eating disorder body dysmorphia. can even find eating disorders


like pica, people actually ingest things like dirt rocks metal
genuine appetite things. certainly not recommend sampling
non food items. foods, incredibly dangerous. People often poisoned
themselves. often can cause structural blockages people died
sorts things. nonetheless, aspects brain biology
disrupted can lead bizarre types eating behavior, sometimes pica
caused malnutrition, not always. today going focus
prevalent eating disorders, going build toward understanding
looking healthy metabolism eating satiety hunger looks like.
one, realized not everyone eating disorder. two,
want people understand relationship think, decisions
take eat body brain subconscious levels
driving behaviors healthy otherwise. think can lead
us better understanding healthy eating us,

00:39:44 Hunger? Satiety?

increase compassion hopefully even increased improvement treatment
eating disorders suffering them. So, hunger
satiety? Satiety, course sated feeling like enough food. want
remind people basic mechanisms brain body communicate.
vitally important, not just discussion, discussion,
think, behave, feel, body communicating two types information
brain regular basis, particular around feeding, two types
information mechanical information, chemical information. mean
mechanical information? Well, take deep breath, oh, hold breath,
find can hold breath lot longer exhale air
hold breath lungs empty. reason not
lungs full, enough oxygen therefore can hold breath.
lungs full, particular class neurons called baroreceptors,
send information brain say, pressure lungs. means
probably oxygen here. trigger breathe actually suppressed,
lungs empty. Even plenty oxygen system,
baroreceptors send different signal brain, no oxygen


breathe. impulse breathe comes earlier. Likewise,
stomach full, sends signals brain purely based mechanical
fullness, nothing nutrients, says full. therefore don't
hungry. Don't motivate find ingest food. Whereas gut empty, even
plenty nutrients plenty body fat stores, tend focus food bit more.
So, volume mechanical influences profound effect think.
consider not doing, likewise chemical effects. ingest food,
so-called blood sugar blood glucose levels go up. information signaled
brain via neuronal pathways hormonal pathways. particular,
neurons within gut, signal areas brain stem involved satiety

body inform brain presence different levels nutrients.
generally comes three sources. First all, body fat. body fat have,

goes brain suppresses appetite. body brain signaling mechanism
says, look, enough, not incidentally, leptin signaling disrupted people

00:46:17 Fat, Leptin & Fertility & Metabolic Dysfunctions Obesity

just generally works. can see episode science fat loss.


body fat something else really interesting relates anorexia,
sufficient levels body fat leptin circulating blood. leptin signal gets
brain, hypothalamus pituitary gland register signal.
completely subconscious way, trigger deployment eggs females
production sperm males. So, body fat stores low, reason
periods shut off sperm production reduced even shut off not
enough leptin getting hypothalamus pituitary. shut off
signals, hormones, things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, hormones. So, don't remember
names don't want travel ovary testes cause ovary
testes ovulate produce sperm. So, reason anorexic stopped
periods, stopped cycling, isn't sufficient leptin
bloodstream. Now attempts give leptin anorexics leptin
sequenced peptide synthesized. can inject leptin
people. studies done that, happens, not
tend alleviate anorexia, not cause people start eating again.
actually makes sense leptin also way shutting off hunger signals
saying, body fats way saying, hey, lot body fat here,
sufficient body fat. doesn't even lot, has, cases
shown rescue menstrual, cycling anorexics, okay? So, body fat
signaling brain. gut signaling brain. neurons gut
primarily responding meaning fire electrical signals.
sufficient fatty acids coming fats ingest, amino acids coming proteins
ingest sugars coming carbohydrates sugars. Things like fructose, glucose,
et cetera. signals sent fat gut brain.
therefore body multiple signals directing toward eating eating

AgRP neuron saying, eat, eat, get excited eat. category
neurons. POMC neurons suppressing hunger. acting like
break, body informing brain time status body
whether not needs food not. So, might ask people
overweight lot body fat, continue eat lot, well past
certain threshold body fat start getting so-called metabolic

framing stuff around eating motivated behaviors can go


awry, not just eating disorders, us. Basically said was,
evolutionary standpoint, makes sense eat often can, much

00:55:30 Homeostasis & Reward Systems/Decisions

Dr. Halpern colleagues order try treat things like binge
eating disorder? Well, can frame behavior, good decision making bad
decision-making. pretty simple box diagram model. realized many
listening this, not watching this. no diagram look at. just explain
can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,
one box, okay? eat that. shouldn't eat that. wait dinner.
shouldn't wait dinner. actually another box, okay?
Now true behaviors, say something want say something,
don't, shouldn't say something, anyway. knowledge
kind looping head. homework. go run. shouldn't
right now. shouldn't social media, kinds shoulds
shouldn'ts circulating head. one box. actually
do. behavior, whether not suppress behavior, turn off phone
go read book go sleep whether not stay night, stay
another hour, even five minutes. two boxes two intervening
forces. intervening forces critically important. intervening forces
homeostatic processes, called processes, thing, homeostatic processes,
regulate balance different systems body, hot cold, awake
asleep, dopamine desire pursue things, serotonin desire just relax
chill. So, homeostatic processes reward systems. now move

Now, don't want abstract here. saying person starves

homeostatic processes reward processes associated food,

anorexia sort thing see rich societies. spoiled


children much food decide going focus slim

mentioned earlier, now nuanced new classifications anorexia
even individuals still menstruate maintain sperm production
anorexia, can still considered clinically diagnosable disorder. Now, typically
anorexia starts adolescence, right around puberty. take look puberty is.
Puberty broad level significant dramatic developmental step.
Anyone goes lifespan. body changes, brain changes,

little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related

purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,

rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods

masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel

features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within

put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one

Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom

not passing judgment. just like see data. important

self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just

way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can

depression, talked powerful aspect major depression,
anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe

overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic
suffering sort disorder. just means human

anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self

beautiful studies done colleague, Jeremy Bailenson's lab

relieving, say encouraging therapies
talked family based model, Connie behavioral treatments. Yes,
drug treatments well. habit intervention model one starts shift
things, appear perception self seems follow
perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning

accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind

somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue

many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,

indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called

particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire

invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral

So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things

just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area

Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know

Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing

00:29:00 Anorexia Nervosa (Overview & Myths)

disorders. Now mouthful, no pun intended. major eating
disorders? Anorexia nervosa, commonly referred anorexia perhaps


prevalent dangerous eating disorders. fact, anorexia
dangerous psychiatric disorder all, even depression. probability
death untreated anorexia high, sadly prevalence anorexia
high. So, anorexia prevalent it? Anorexia, look online
talk qualified professional, essentially failure eat enough, maintain
healthy weight. can see sorts troubling symptoms somebody
anorexic period time, general loss muscle mass
ingesting fewer calories burn. Muscle metabolically active. tend
lose lot muscle mass. will low heart rate. body brain's
attempt lower energy output. will low blood pressure. sometimes
symptoms like fainting. will sometimes even hair growth face,
something called lanugo, essentially body's attempt insulate body
loss body heat. thin. Loss bone density, osteoporosis,
loss periods girls women, sorts disrupted gut immune functions.
So, just tons terrible symptoms anorexia really placed anorexic
risky state, mortality anorexia gone untreated extremely
high. Now, one misconceptions anorexia, stems
overemphasis perfectionism, images social media
advertising extremely thin fit muscular people individuals looking
comparing images thinking don't
match developing anorexia, turns not case. look
prevalence rates anorexia, last 10 years 20 years, compare
anorexia first identified, 1600s, perhaps even
earlier, find rates anorexia not going up. So, idea
images bombarded causing anorexia doesn't seem true.
Now, not say images particular young people
bombarded healthy psychological state mind. classically define
anorexia existed essentially prevalence last 100, 200, 300
400 years, incredible really speaks likelihood strong
biological contribution call anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa extremely
common. anywhere one 2% women. typical onset
adolescence close puberty, can show later life well. fact,
identification diagnosis anorexia tends early '20s. look back
history individuals, typically signs anorexia back


early teens. maybe even that. Now, course, men can anorexic
well, anorexia nervosa seem occur 10 times rate women young
girls, men young boys. So, seem
prevalence anorexia boys young men, days, probably due better
diagnosis detection sort societal shift related imagery, et
cetera. Later, will talk body dysmorphia images
present media social media impacting forms eating

individuals suffer it.

00:33:44 Bulimia (Overview & Myths)

Now, say hard wired, doesn't mean can't treated cured,
indeed can. Bulimia defined binge eating overeating. Let explain
is. Binge eating consuming vast amounts calories short period
time. Overeating can ingesting calories one needs, extended
period time, can exist course, bulimia also common.
common young girls women young boys men, present
sexes. Bulimia rates bulimia might increasing. sort
interesting finding. not quite clear whether not existed form
long period time within new forms evolving showing up,
going drill bulimia actually represents. one thing
want clear about, just perfectionist mindset associated
anorexia, turns not case. can be, not always associated
anorexia. idea bulimia associated early trauma
childhood, particular sexual trauma. can case, no direct
correlation two. Now, obviously psychological phenomena trauma can
profound impact way brain wires way people
approach food types behaviors. sort classic idea
anorexics perfectionists, want perform well. control
autonomy. bulimics kind dysregulated acting early
sexual trauma, stereotypes psychological framework anorexics


bulimics, doesn't hold up. look data, many, many meta analysis
done. just simply not case. instances, anorexia
bulimia, clear biological underpinnings, driving under-eating
overeating. So, going talk biology eating overeating
appropriate levels eating. that, will start identify
mechanisms serve entry points treatment anorexia bulimia.
probably aware, anorexia bulimia can comorbid,
can exist one another. anorexics will binge purge order
maintain unhealthily low weight. bulimics fit psychological
criteria anorexia. lot overlap two categories. Now
talk categorization second categorization led now
bunch eating disorders defined psychiatric community. One
classic symptoms anorexia loss menstrual cycles, loss periods.
reason body undernourished, body fat stores, send signals
brain inform body undernourished, turn off signals say,
look, enough body fat cells support healthy metabolism.
therefore shut ovulation, literally signal sent fat muscle
brain brain, hypothalamus pituitary will send signals ovaries,
will turn off signals heading ovaries deploy eggs, maturation
eggs follicle, et cetera. So, instances people anorexia
bulimia, still maintaining healthy menstrual cycles

00:37:35 Binge Eating Disorders, EDNOS, OSFEDS, Pica

least menstrual cycles. led whole set categorizations
eating disorders, like binge eating disorder, tends lot overeating,
not purging categorizations anorexia, people feeding,
not losing periods. number different names
acronyms. include things like, EDNOS, EDNOS eating disorder, not
otherwise specified. So, sub categorization OSFEDs. So, OSFEDs
specified feeding eating disorder. So, right now, look online
looking psychiatric psychological textbooks, find
huge constellation eating disorders today. mainly going talk anorexia,
bulimia, binge eating disorder body dysmorphia. can even find eating disorders


like pica, people actually ingest things like dirt rocks metal
genuine appetite things. certainly not recommend sampling
non food items. foods, incredibly dangerous. People often poisoned
themselves. often can cause structural blockages people died
sorts things. nonetheless, aspects brain biology
disrupted can lead bizarre types eating behavior, sometimes pica
caused malnutrition, not always. today going focus
prevalent eating disorders, going build toward understanding
looking healthy metabolism eating satiety hunger looks like.
one, realized not everyone eating disorder. two,
want people understand relationship think, decisions
take eat body brain subconscious levels
driving behaviors healthy otherwise. think can lead
us better understanding healthy eating us,

00:39:44 Hunger? Satiety?

increase compassion hopefully even increased improvement treatment
eating disorders suffering them. So, hunger
satiety? Satiety, course sated feeling like enough food. want
remind people basic mechanisms brain body communicate.
vitally important, not just discussion, discussion,
think, behave, feel, body communicating two types information
brain regular basis, particular around feeding, two types
information mechanical information, chemical information. mean
mechanical information? Well, take deep breath, oh, hold breath,
find can hold breath lot longer exhale air
hold breath lungs empty. reason not
lungs full, enough oxygen therefore can hold breath.
lungs full, particular class neurons called baroreceptors,
send information brain say, pressure lungs. means
probably oxygen here. trigger breathe actually suppressed,
lungs empty. Even plenty oxygen system,
baroreceptors send different signal brain, no oxygen


breathe. impulse breathe comes earlier. Likewise,
stomach full, sends signals brain purely based mechanical
fullness, nothing nutrients, says full. therefore don't
hungry. Don't motivate find ingest food. Whereas gut empty, even
plenty nutrients plenty body fat stores, tend focus food bit more.
So, volume mechanical influences profound effect think.
consider not doing, likewise chemical effects. ingest food,
so-called blood sugar blood glucose levels go up. information signaled
brain via neuronal pathways hormonal pathways. particular,
neurons within gut, signal areas brain stem involved satiety

body inform brain presence different levels nutrients.
generally comes three sources. First all, body fat. body fat have,
secrete hormone called leptin, L-E-P-T-I-N, leptin body fat, leptin
goes brain suppresses appetite. body brain signaling mechanism
says, look, enough, not incidentally, leptin signaling disrupted people

00:46:17 Fat, Leptin & Fertility & Metabolic Dysfunctions Obesity

just generally works. can see episode science fat loss.


body fat something else really interesting relates anorexia,
sufficient levels body fat leptin circulating blood. leptin signal gets
brain, hypothalamus pituitary gland register signal.
completely subconscious way, trigger deployment eggs females
production sperm males. So, body fat stores low, reason
periods shut off sperm production reduced even shut off not
enough leptin getting hypothalamus pituitary. shut off
signals, hormones, things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, hormones. So, don't remember
names don't want travel ovary testes cause ovary
testes ovulate produce sperm. So, reason anorexic stopped
periods, stopped cycling, isn't sufficient leptin
bloodstream. Now attempts give leptin anorexics leptin
sequenced peptide synthesized. can inject leptin
people. studies done that, happens, not
tend alleviate anorexia, not cause people start eating again.
actually makes sense leptin also way shutting off hunger signals
saying, body fats way saying, hey, lot body fat here,
sufficient body fat. doesn't even lot, has, cases
shown rescue menstrual, cycling anorexics, okay? So, body fat
signaling brain. gut signaling brain. neurons gut
primarily responding meaning fire electrical signals.
sufficient fatty acids coming fats ingest, amino acids coming proteins
ingest sugars coming carbohydrates sugars. Things like fructose, glucose,
et cetera. signals sent fat gut brain.
therefore body multiple signals directing toward eating eating

AgRP neuron saying, eat, eat, get excited eat. category

break, body informing brain time status body
whether not needs food not. So, might ask people
overweight lot body fat, continue eat lot, well past
certain threshold body fat start getting so-called metabolic

00:50:30 Overeat

eat slowly, mindful eating, et cetera. So, anticipation

framing stuff around eating motivated behaviors can go


awry, not just eating disorders, us. Basically said was,
evolutionary standpoint, makes sense eat often can, much
can, fast can. Well, sounds crazy. told eat not

food possible. purely evolutionary standpoint, food

00:55:30 Homeostasis & Reward Systems/Decisions

Dr. Halpern colleagues order try treat things like binge
eating disorder? Well, can frame behavior, good decision making bad
decision-making. pretty simple box diagram model. realized many
listening this, not watching this. no diagram look at. just explain
can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,
one box, okay? eat that. shouldn't eat that. wait dinner.
shouldn't wait dinner. actually another box, okay?
Now true behaviors, say something want say something,
don't, shouldn't say something, anyway. knowledge
kind looping head. homework. go run. shouldn't
right now. shouldn't social media, kinds shoulds
shouldn'ts circulating head. one box. actually
do. behavior, whether not suppress behavior, turn off phone
go read book go sleep whether not stay night, stay
another hour, even five minutes. two boxes two intervening
forces. intervening forces critically important. intervening forces
homeostatic processes, called processes, thing, homeostatic processes,
regulate balance different systems body, hot cold, awake
asleep, dopamine desire pursue things, serotonin desire just relax
chill. So, homeostatic processes reward systems. now move

Now, don't want abstract here. saying person starves

homeostatic processes reward processes associated food,

earlier, anorexia things almost certainly were, anorexia

saints, 1400s people refuse ingest food. Another common myth
anorexia sort thing see rich societies. spoiled


children much food decide going focus slim

interesting points disruption biological mechanism. Now,
want make sure emphasizing not favor people, particular
young children, adolescents, teenagers bombarded unrealistic imagery

mentioned earlier, now nuanced new classifications anorexia
even individuals still menstruate maintain sperm production
anorexia, can still considered clinically diagnosable disorder. Now, typically
anorexia starts adolescence, right around puberty. take look puberty is.
Puberty broad level significant dramatic developmental step.
Anyone goes lifespan. body changes, brain changes,

sense, drugs increase serotonin, general effect increase
serotonin, will lower anxiety. sounds like great thing. lot anorexics
really anxious around food. talk why, lowering anxiety might think
lead ingestion food, not often happens, increasing serotonin,

little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related

purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry

feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit

put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,

called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human
knowledge knowledge can allow make better decisions. say again,
beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining
weight, don't constantly treadmill, no pun intended
balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-
exercise induced thermogenesis people tend thin, tend bounce
around lot. kind fidgety burns 1000 calories day, anywhere
800 2000 calories day. Now can beneficial folks
overweight healthy mindset food, trying lose weight.
turns by, literally fidgeting bouncing around, like,
this. looks ridiculous. actually burn lot body fat calories. way provide


caloric deficit, burn body fat body fat not just passive
tissue. actually receives input neurons release noradrenaline adrenaline.
neat. described several decades now. actually pretty
terrific way burn off calories. So, anorexic, actually want
encourage not constantly trying burn off calories. can
challenging. So, shifting toward activities like weight bearing activities resistance
training promote

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode
depression, talked powerful aspect major depression,
anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe
statements feelings behaviors start reflect lie. not
conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic
suffering sort disorder. just means human
cares appear world. not judge case
anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self
image much don't actually see accurately, visual
perceptions off. reason know this, really important
beautiful studies done colleague, Jeremy Bailenson's lab
Stanford, department communications, actually collaborated Dr.
Halpern mentioned earlier. really interesting studies


give us window perceptual defect anorexics have. actually done one
experiments. fortunate not anorexic, done work
VR lab there. get get adjust avatar
point think it's, accurate possibly be, anorexics, really
distort avatar. words, create serious mismatch
perception reality. So, indeed seem case now
relieving, say encouraging therapies
talked family based model, Connie behavioral treatments. Yes,
drug treatments well. habit intervention model one starts shift
things, appear perception self seems follow
perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning
don't change easily. Whereas appears circuitry related habit
formation, decision-making reward, circuitry, stuff can rewired.
anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need
eat. doesn't seem work. just don't see way
see them. offer point consideration, know someone
anorexic, look anorexic think, still critical
small, even nonexistent amount body fat triceps something?
that? Well, literally brain, relates perceptions, visual perceptions
particular, completely off.

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar

think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing

embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young

impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper

indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food

people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things

this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area

Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing

disorders. Now mouthful, no pun intended. major eating
disorders? Anorexia nervosa, commonly referred anorexia perhaps


prevalent dangerous eating disorders. fact, anorexia
dangerous psychiatric disorder all, even depression. probability
death untreated anorexia high, sadly prevalence anorexia
high. So, anorexia prevalent it? Anorexia, look online
talk qualified professional, essentially failure eat enough, maintain
healthy weight. can see sorts troubling symptoms somebody
anorexic period time, general loss muscle mass
ingesting fewer calories burn. Muscle metabolically active. tend

So, just tons terrible symptoms anorexia really placed anorexic
risky state, mortality anorexia gone untreated extremely
high. Now, one misconceptions anorexia, stems
overemphasis perfectionism, images social media
advertising extremely thin fit muscular people individuals looking
comparing images thinking don't
match developing anorexia, turns not case. look
prevalence rates anorexia, last 10 years 20 years, compare
anorexia first identified, 1600s, perhaps even
earlier, find rates anorexia not going up. So, idea
images bombarded causing anorexia doesn't seem true.
Now, not say images particular young people

00:33:44 Bulimia (Overview & Myths)

Now, say hard wired, doesn't mean can't treated cured,
indeed can. Bulimia defined binge eating overeating. Let explain
is. Binge eating consuming vast amounts calories short period
time. Overeating can ingesting calories one needs, extended
period time, can exist course, bulimia also common.
common young girls women young boys men, present
sexes. Bulimia rates bulimia might increasing. sort
interesting finding. not quite clear whether not existed form

going drill bulimia actually represents. one thing
want clear about, just perfectionist mindset associated
anorexia, turns not case. can be, not always associated

sexual trauma, stereotypes psychological framework anorexics


bulimics, doesn't hold up. look data, many, many meta analysis

appropriate levels eating. that, will start identify

probably aware, anorexia bulimia can comorbid,
can exist one another. anorexics will binge purge order
maintain unhealthily low weight. bulimics fit psychological
criteria anorexia. lot overlap two categories. Now
talk categorization second categorization led now
bunch eating disorders defined psychiatric community. One
classic symptoms anorexia loss menstrual cycles, loss periods.
reason body undernourished, body fat stores, send signals

look, enough body fat cells support healthy metabolism.
therefore shut ovulation, literally signal sent fat muscle

looking psychiatric psychological textbooks, find
huge constellation eating disorders today. mainly going talk anorexia,
bulimia, binge eating disorder body dysmorphia. can even find eating disorders


like pica, people actually ingest things like dirt rocks metal

satiety? Satiety, course sated feeling like enough food. want
remind people basic mechanisms brain body communicate.
vitally important, not just discussion, discussion,
think, behave, feel, body communicating two types information
brain regular basis, particular around feeding, two types
information mechanical information, chemical information. mean
mechanical information? Well, take deep breath, oh, hold breath,
find can hold breath lot longer exhale air
hold breath lungs empty. reason not
lungs full, enough oxygen therefore can hold breath.
lungs full, particular class neurons called baroreceptors,
send information brain say, pressure lungs. means
probably oxygen here. trigger breathe actually suppressed,
lungs empty. Even plenty oxygen system,
baroreceptors send different signal brain, no oxygen


breathe. impulse breathe comes earlier. Likewise,
stomach full, sends signals brain purely based mechanical
fullness, nothing nutrients, says full. therefore don't
hungry. Don't motivate find ingest food. Whereas gut empty, even
plenty nutrients plenty body fat stores, tend focus food bit more.
So, volume mechanical influences profound effect think.
consider not doing, likewise chemical effects. ingest food,
so-called blood sugar blood glucose levels go up. information signaled

generally comes three sources. First all, body fat. body fat have,

00:46:17 Fat, Leptin & Fertility & Metabolic Dysfunctions Obesity

just generally works. can see episode science fat loss.


body fat something else really interesting relates anorexia,
sufficient levels body fat leptin circulating blood. leptin signal gets
brain, hypothalamus pituitary gland register signal.
completely subconscious way, trigger deployment eggs females
production sperm males. So, body fat stores low, reason
periods shut off sperm production reduced even shut off not
enough leptin getting hypothalamus pituitary. shut off
signals, hormones, things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, hormones. So, don't remember
names don't want travel ovary testes cause ovary
testes ovulate produce sperm. So, reason anorexic stopped
periods, stopped cycling, isn't sufficient leptin
bloodstream. Now attempts give leptin anorexics leptin
sequenced peptide synthesized. can inject leptin
people. studies done that, happens, not
tend alleviate anorexia, not cause people start eating again.
actually makes sense leptin also way shutting off hunger signals
saying, body fats way saying, hey, lot body fat here,
sufficient body fat. doesn't even lot, has, cases
shown rescue menstrual, cycling anorexics, okay? So, body fat
signaling brain. gut signaling brain. neurons gut
primarily responding meaning fire electrical signals.
sufficient fatty acids coming fats ingest, amino acids coming proteins
ingest sugars coming carbohydrates sugars. Things like fructose, glucose,
et cetera. signals sent fat gut brain.
therefore body multiple signals directing toward eating eating

AgRP neuron saying, eat, eat, get excited eat. category
neurons. POMC neurons suppressing hunger. acting like
break, body informing brain time status body
whether not needs food not. So, might ask people
overweight lot body fat, continue eat lot, well past
certain threshold body fat start getting so-called metabolic

00:50:30 Overeat

framing stuff around eating motivated behaviors can go


awry, not just eating disorders, us. Basically said was,
evolutionary standpoint, makes sense eat often can, much
can, fast can. Well, sounds crazy. told eat not

00:55:30 Homeostasis & Reward Systems/Decisions

Dr. Halpern colleagues order try treat things like binge
eating disorder? Well, can frame behavior, good decision making bad
decision-making. pretty simple box diagram model. realized many
listening this, not watching this. no diagram look at. just explain
can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,
one box, okay? eat that. shouldn't eat that. wait dinner.
shouldn't wait dinner. actually another box, okay?
Now true behaviors, say something want say something,
don't, shouldn't say something, anyway. knowledge
kind looping head. homework. go run. shouldn't
right now. shouldn't social media, kinds shoulds
shouldn'ts circulating head. one box. actually
do. behavior, whether not suppress behavior, turn off phone
go read book go sleep whether not stay night, stay
another hour, even five minutes. two boxes two intervening
forces. intervening forces critically important. intervening forces
homeostatic processes, called processes, thing, homeostatic processes,
regulate balance different systems body, hot cold, awake
asleep, dopamine desire pursue things, serotonin desire just relax
chill. So, homeostatic processes reward systems. now move

Now, don't want abstract here. saying person starves

homeostatic processes reward processes associated food,

earlier, anorexia things almost certainly were, anorexia

anorexia sort thing see rich societies. spoiled


children much food decide going focus slim

mentioned earlier, now nuanced new classifications anorexia
even individuals still menstruate maintain sperm production
anorexia, can still considered clinically diagnosable disorder. Now, typically
anorexia starts adolescence, right around puberty. take look puberty is.
Puberty broad level significant dramatic developmental step.
Anyone goes lifespan. body changes, brain changes,

little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related

01:24:06 Habit-Reward Circuits Flipped Anorexics: Reward Deprivation

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit

habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within

involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal

Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical

clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating

pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just

Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can

anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life

overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face

anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self

beautiful studies done colleague, Jeremy Bailenson's lab

talked family based model, Connie behavioral treatments. Yes,
drug treatments well. habit intervention model one starts shift

perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning

accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar

think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing

feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young

impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper

indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just
pump brakes little bit, no break, right? So, start going faster
faster faster. choice use accelerator just coach it.
essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern
others, think really exciting. even though highly invasive, think going
lead not just relief patients get deep brain stimulation,
also identification sorts receptors present brain areas.

disorder, understand receptors, brain areas express,
can start additional interventions way non invasive treatments, things like
drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral
interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

prevalent dangerous eating disorders. fact, anorexia
dangerous psychiatric disorder all, even depression. probability
death untreated anorexia high, sadly prevalence anorexia
high. So, anorexia prevalent it? Anorexia, look online
talk qualified professional, essentially failure eat enough, maintain
healthy weight. can see sorts troubling symptoms somebody
anorexic period time, general loss muscle mass
ingesting fewer calories burn. Muscle metabolically active. tend
lose lot muscle mass. will low heart rate. body brain's
attempt lower energy output. will low blood pressure. sometimes
symptoms like fainting. will sometimes even hair growth face,
something called lanugo, essentially body's attempt insulate body
loss body heat. thin. Loss bone density, osteoporosis,
loss periods girls women, sorts disrupted gut immune functions.
So, just tons terrible symptoms anorexia really placed anorexic
risky state, mortality anorexia gone untreated extremely
high. Now, one misconceptions anorexia, stems
overemphasis perfectionism, images social media
advertising extremely thin fit muscular people individuals looking
comparing images thinking don't
match developing anorexia, turns not case. look
prevalence rates anorexia, last 10 years 20 years, compare
anorexia first identified, 1600s, perhaps even
earlier, find rates anorexia not going up. So, idea
images bombarded causing anorexia doesn't seem true.
Now, not say images particular young people
bombarded healthy psychological state mind. classically define
anorexia existed essentially prevalence last 100, 200, 300
400 years, incredible really speaks likelihood strong
biological contribution call anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa extremely
common. anywhere one 2% women. typical onset
adolescence close puberty, can show later life well. fact,
identification diagnosis anorexia tends early '20s. look back
history individuals, typically signs anorexia back


early teens. maybe even that. Now, course, men can anorexic
well, anorexia nervosa seem occur 10 times rate women young
girls, men young boys. So, seem
prevalence anorexia boys young men, days, probably due better
diagnosis detection sort societal shift related imagery, et
cetera. Later, will talk body dysmorphia images
present media social media impacting forms eating
disorders. look anorexia nervosa, failure maintain weight, even
healthy levels often drops weight dangerous even deadly,
existed long time, seems somewhat hardwired biology
individuals suffer it.

00:33:44 Bulimia (Overview & Myths)

Now, say hard wired, doesn't mean can't treated cured,
indeed can. Bulimia defined binge eating overeating. Let explain
is. Binge eating consuming vast amounts calories short period
time. Overeating can ingesting calories one needs, extended
period time, can exist course, bulimia also common.
common young girls women young boys men, present
sexes. Bulimia rates bulimia might increasing. sort
interesting finding. not quite clear whether not existed form
long period time within new forms evolving showing up,
going drill bulimia actually represents. one thing
want clear about, just perfectionist mindset associated
anorexia, turns not case. can be, not always associated
anorexia. idea bulimia associated early trauma
childhood, particular sexual trauma. can case, no direct
correlation two. Now, obviously psychological phenomena trauma can
profound impact way brain wires way people
approach food types behaviors. sort classic idea
anorexics perfectionists, want perform well. control
autonomy. bulimics kind dysregulated acting early
sexual trauma, stereotypes psychological framework anorexics


bulimics, doesn't hold up. look data, many, many meta analysis
done. just simply not case. instances, anorexia
bulimia, clear biological underpinnings, driving under-eating
overeating. So, going talk biology eating overeating
appropriate levels eating. that, will start identify
mechanisms serve entry points treatment anorexia bulimia.
probably aware, anorexia bulimia can comorbid,
can exist one another. anorexics will binge purge order
maintain unhealthily low weight. bulimics fit psychological
criteria anorexia. lot overlap two categories. Now
talk categorization second categorization led now
bunch eating disorders defined psychiatric community. One
classic symptoms anorexia loss menstrual cycles, loss periods.
reason body undernourished, body fat stores, send signals
brain inform body undernourished, turn off signals say,
look, enough body fat cells support healthy metabolism.
therefore shut ovulation, literally signal sent fat muscle
brain brain, hypothalamus pituitary will send signals ovaries,
will turn off signals heading ovaries deploy eggs, maturation
eggs follicle, et cetera. So, instances people anorexia
bulimia, still maintaining healthy menstrual cycles

00:37:35 Binge Eating Disorders, EDNOS, OSFEDS, Pica

least menstrual cycles. led whole set categorizations
eating disorders, like binge eating disorder, tends lot overeating,
not purging categorizations anorexia, people feeding,
not losing periods. number different names
acronyms. include things like, EDNOS, EDNOS eating disorder, not
otherwise specified. So, sub categorization OSFEDs. So, OSFEDs
specified feeding eating disorder. So, right now, look online
looking psychiatric psychological textbooks, find
huge constellation eating disorders today. mainly going talk anorexia,
bulimia, binge eating disorder body dysmorphia. can even find eating disorders


like pica, people actually ingest things like dirt rocks metal
genuine appetite things. certainly not recommend sampling
non food items. foods, incredibly dangerous. People often poisoned
themselves. often can cause structural blockages people died
sorts things. nonetheless, aspects brain biology
disrupted can lead bizarre types eating behavior, sometimes pica
caused malnutrition, not always. today going focus
prevalent eating disorders, going build toward understanding
looking healthy metabolism eating satiety hunger looks like.
one, realized not everyone eating disorder. two,
want people understand relationship think, decisions
take eat body brain subconscious levels
driving behaviors healthy otherwise. think can lead
us better understanding healthy eating us,

00:39:44 Hunger? Satiety?

increase compassion hopefully even increased improvement treatment
eating disorders suffering them. So, hunger
satiety? Satiety, course sated feeling like enough food. want
remind people basic mechanisms brain body communicate.
vitally important, not just discussion, discussion,
think, behave, feel, body communicating two types information
brain regular basis, particular around feeding, two types
information mechanical information, chemical information. mean
mechanical information? Well, take deep breath, oh, hold breath,
find can hold breath lot longer exhale air
hold breath lungs empty. reason not
lungs full, enough oxygen therefore can hold breath.
lungs full, particular class neurons called baroreceptors,
send information brain say, pressure lungs. means
probably oxygen here. trigger breathe actually suppressed,
lungs empty. Even plenty oxygen system,
baroreceptors send different signal brain, no oxygen


breathe. impulse breathe comes earlier. Likewise,
stomach full, sends signals brain purely based mechanical
fullness, nothing nutrients, says full. therefore don't
hungry. Don't motivate find ingest food. Whereas gut empty, even
plenty nutrients plenty body fat stores, tend focus food bit more.
So, volume mechanical influences profound effect think.
consider not doing, likewise chemical effects. ingest food,
so-called blood sugar blood glucose levels go up. information signaled
brain via neuronal pathways hormonal pathways. particular,
neurons within gut, signal areas brain stem involved satiety
sense enough

00:42:00 Neuronal & Hormonal “Accelerators & Brakes” Eating

food system. So, chemical information. So, hunger
feeding satiety regulated way mechanical chemical signaling. have,
have, neurons hypothalamus trigger eating neurons
trigger cessation stopping eating. accelerator eating
break. covered lot detail episode feeding metabolism
hunger. So, want lot detail, see episode, right now, just
going give top contour works. hypothalamus area
forebrain, tells front, base forebrain sits
less roof mouth. hypothalamus contains lots different
kinds neurons, including neurons stimulate sexual activity desire, regulate
body temperature control appetite ceasing eating appetite.
two types neurons within particular area hypothalamus relevant
here. so-called POMC neurons, okay? Pro-opiomelanocortin neurons
tend act break appetite, way another hormone called
melanocytes stimulating hormone. not incidentally getting lot
sunlight viewing lot sunlight, system ramped up.
appetite lower summer months winter months. true
animals. true humans. class neurons called AgRP
neurons. AgRP neurons ones stimulate feeding, create sort
anxiety excitement food, can positive anxiety, can negative


anxiety. mean that? Well, ever seen kids heading get ice cream,
absolutely excited. see people getting raised, sit eat big meal.
excited eat. Sometimes due social factors, increase
overall levels autonomic arousal. depending context, can feel
excited anxious, ramping energy. AgRP neurons
caused that, fact much eliminate kill neurons,
done experimental mouse models laboratory, also humans
lesions neurotoxic effects AgRP neurons. find
don't want eat. essentially become anorexic, meaning don't want
ingest food. no appetite food whatsoever. Now not exactly
anorexia is, AgRP neurons like accelerator wanting eat. Whereas
stimulate AgRP neurons humans say small tumor near
AgRP neurons, become hyperphagic. will eat point bursting,
animals humans elevated levels AgRP neurons anxious.
want eat, will ingest food point override
mechanical chemical signals body. know sounds horrible,
horrible. will eat point burst. Now, signals coming back
body inform brain presence different levels nutrients.
generally comes three sources. First all, body fat. body fat have,
secrete hormone called leptin, L-E-P-T-I-N, leptin body fat, leptin
goes brain suppresses appetite. body brain signaling mechanism
says, look, enough, not incidentally, leptin signaling disrupted people
bulimia obesity certain forms binge eating disorder. So, system
disrupted enough signal enough body fat
don't need eat right here, sort voice body fat, trying talk
brain, signal, dialogue mixed messed up. cases
absent entirely. So, body fat signaling brain much reserve
have. sort like savings account energy, 'cause body fat is.
got lipids lipolysis, can metabolized. interested
process, increase it.

00:46:17 Fat, Leptin & Fertility & Metabolic Dysfunctions Obesity

just generally works. can see episode science fat loss.


body fat something else really interesting relates anorexia,
sufficient levels body fat leptin circulating blood. leptin signal gets
brain, hypothalamus pituitary gland register signal.
completely subconscious way, trigger deployment eggs females
production sperm males. So, body fat stores low, reason
periods shut off sperm production reduced even shut off not
enough leptin getting hypothalamus pituitary. shut off
signals, hormones, things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, hormones. So, don't remember
names don't want travel ovary testes cause ovary
testes ovulate produce sperm. So, reason anorexic stopped
periods, stopped cycling, isn't sufficient leptin
bloodstream. Now attempts give leptin anorexics leptin
sequenced peptide synthesized. can inject leptin
people. studies done that, happens, not
tend alleviate anorexia, not cause people start eating again.
actually makes sense leptin also way shutting off hunger signals
saying, body fats way saying, hey, lot body fat here,
sufficient body fat. doesn't even lot, has, cases
shown rescue menstrual, cycling anorexics, okay? So, body fat

00:55:30 Homeostasis & Reward Systems/Decisions

Dr. Halpern colleagues order try treat things like binge
eating disorder? Well, can frame behavior, good decision making bad
decision-making. pretty simple box diagram model. realized many
listening this, not watching this. no diagram look at. just explain
can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,
one box, okay? eat that. shouldn't eat that. wait dinner.
shouldn't wait dinner. actually another box, okay?
Now true behaviors, say something want say something,
don't, shouldn't say something, anyway. knowledge
kind looping head. homework. go run. shouldn't
right now. shouldn't social media, kinds shoulds
shouldn'ts circulating head. one box. actually
do. behavior, whether not suppress behavior, turn off phone
go read book go sleep whether not stay night, stay
another hour, even five minutes. two boxes two intervening
forces. intervening forces critically important. intervening forces
homeostatic processes, called processes, thing, homeostatic processes,
regulate balance different systems body, hot cold, awake

homeostatic processes reward processes associated food,

even individuals still menstruate maintain sperm production
anorexia, can still considered clinically diagnosable disorder. Now, typically
anorexia starts adolescence, right around puberty. take look puberty is.
Puberty broad level significant dramatic developmental step.

little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related

01:24:06 Habit-Reward Circuits Flipped Anorexics: Reward Deprivation

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit

habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within

involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal

Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,

Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing

sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical

clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just

way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might

common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue

many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar

impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper

indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see

bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just
pump brakes little bit, no break, right? So, start going faster
faster faster. choice use accelerator just coach it.
essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern
others, think really exciting. even though highly invasive, think going
lead not just relief patients get deep brain stimulation,
also identification sorts receptors present brain areas.
help. means understand brain areas involved
disorder, understand receptors, brain areas express,
can start additional interventions way non invasive treatments, things like
drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral
interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat

fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

00:33:44 Bulimia (Overview & Myths)

Now, say hard wired, doesn't mean can't treated cured,
indeed can. Bulimia defined binge eating overeating. Let explain
is. Binge eating consuming vast amounts calories short period
time. Overeating can ingesting calories one needs, extended
period time, can exist course, bulimia also common.
common young girls women young boys men, present
sexes. Bulimia rates bulimia might increasing. sort
interesting finding. not quite clear whether not existed form
long period time within new forms evolving showing up,
going drill bulimia actually represents. one thing
want clear about, just perfectionist mindset associated
anorexia, turns not case. can be, not always associated
anorexia. idea bulimia associated early trauma
childhood, particular sexual trauma. can case, no direct
correlation two. Now, obviously psychological phenomena trauma can
profound impact way brain wires way people
approach food types behaviors. sort classic idea
anorexics perfectionists, want perform well. control

sexual trauma, stereotypes psychological framework anorexics


bulimics, doesn't hold up. look data, many, many meta analysis
done. just simply not case. instances, anorexia
bulimia, clear biological underpinnings, driving under-eating
overeating. So, going talk biology eating overeating
appropriate levels eating. that, will start identify
mechanisms serve entry points treatment anorexia bulimia.
probably aware, anorexia bulimia can comorbid,
can exist one another. anorexics will binge purge order
maintain unhealthily low weight. bulimics fit psychological
criteria anorexia. lot overlap two categories. Now
talk categorization second categorization led now
bunch eating disorders defined psychiatric community. One
classic symptoms anorexia loss menstrual cycles, loss periods.
reason body undernourished, body fat stores, send signals
brain inform body undernourished, turn off signals say,
look, enough body fat cells support healthy metabolism.
therefore shut ovulation, literally signal sent fat muscle
brain brain, hypothalamus pituitary will send signals ovaries,
will turn off signals heading ovaries deploy eggs, maturation
eggs follicle, et cetera. So, instances people anorexia
bulimia, still maintaining healthy menstrual cycles

00:37:35 Binge Eating Disorders, EDNOS, OSFEDS, Pica

least menstrual cycles. led whole set categorizations
eating disorders, like binge eating disorder, tends lot overeating,
not purging categorizations anorexia, people feeding,
not losing periods. number different names
acronyms. include things like, EDNOS, EDNOS eating disorder, not
otherwise specified. So, sub categorization OSFEDs. So, OSFEDs
specified feeding eating disorder. So, right now, look online
looking psychiatric psychological textbooks, find
huge constellation eating disorders today. mainly going talk anorexia,
bulimia, binge eating disorder body dysmorphia. can even find eating disorders


like pica, people actually ingest things like dirt rocks metal
genuine appetite things. certainly not recommend sampling
non food items. foods, incredibly dangerous. People often poisoned
themselves. often can cause structural blockages people died
sorts things. nonetheless, aspects brain biology
disrupted can lead bizarre types eating behavior, sometimes pica
caused malnutrition, not always. today going focus
prevalent eating disorders, going build toward understanding
looking healthy metabolism eating satiety hunger looks like.
one, realized not everyone eating disorder. two,
want people understand relationship think, decisions
take eat body brain subconscious levels
driving behaviors healthy otherwise. think can lead
us better understanding healthy eating us,

00:39:44 Hunger? Satiety?

increase compassion hopefully even increased improvement treatment
eating disorders suffering them. So, hunger
satiety? Satiety, course sated feeling like enough food. want
remind people basic mechanisms brain body communicate.
vitally important, not just discussion, discussion,
think, behave, feel, body communicating two types information
brain regular basis, particular around feeding, two types
information mechanical information, chemical information. mean
mechanical information? Well, take deep breath, oh, hold breath,
find can hold breath lot longer exhale air
hold breath lungs empty. reason not
lungs full, enough oxygen therefore can hold breath.
lungs full, particular class neurons called baroreceptors,
send information brain say, pressure lungs. means
probably oxygen here. trigger breathe actually suppressed,
lungs empty. Even plenty oxygen system,
baroreceptors send different signal brain, no oxygen


breathe. impulse breathe comes earlier. Likewise,
stomach full, sends signals brain purely based mechanical
fullness, nothing nutrients, says full. therefore don't
hungry. Don't motivate find ingest food. Whereas gut empty, even
plenty nutrients plenty body fat stores, tend focus food bit more.
So, volume mechanical influences profound effect think.
consider not doing, likewise chemical effects. ingest food,
so-called blood sugar blood glucose levels go up. information signaled
brain via neuronal pathways hormonal pathways. particular,
neurons within gut, signal areas brain stem involved satiety
sense enough

00:42:00 Neuronal & Hormonal “Accelerators & Brakes” Eating

food system. So, chemical information. So, hunger
feeding satiety regulated way mechanical chemical signaling. have,
have, neurons hypothalamus trigger eating neurons
trigger cessation stopping eating. accelerator eating
break. covered lot detail episode feeding metabolism
hunger. So, want lot detail, see episode, right now, just
going give top contour works. hypothalamus area
forebrain, tells front, base forebrain sits
less roof mouth. hypothalamus contains lots different
kinds neurons, including neurons stimulate sexual activity desire, regulate
body temperature control appetite ceasing eating appetite.
two types neurons within particular area hypothalamus relevant
here. so-called POMC neurons, okay? Pro-opiomelanocortin neurons
tend act break appetite, way another hormone called
melanocytes stimulating hormone. not incidentally getting lot
sunlight viewing lot sunlight, system ramped up.
appetite lower summer months winter months. true
animals. true humans. class neurons called AgRP
neurons. AgRP neurons ones stimulate feeding, create sort
anxiety excitement food, can positive anxiety, can negative


anxiety. mean that? Well, ever seen kids heading get ice cream,
absolutely excited. see people getting raised, sit eat big meal.
excited eat. Sometimes due social factors, increase
overall levels autonomic arousal. depending context, can feel
excited anxious, ramping energy. AgRP neurons
caused that, fact much eliminate kill neurons,
done experimental mouse models laboratory, also humans
lesions neurotoxic effects AgRP neurons. find
don't want eat. essentially become anorexic, meaning don't want
ingest food. no appetite food whatsoever. Now not exactly
anorexia is, AgRP neurons like accelerator wanting eat. Whereas
stimulate AgRP neurons humans say small tumor near
AgRP neurons, become hyperphagic. will eat point bursting,
animals humans elevated levels AgRP neurons anxious.
want eat, will ingest food point override
mechanical chemical signals body. know sounds horrible,
horrible. will eat point burst. Now, signals coming back
body inform brain presence different levels nutrients.
generally comes three sources. First all, body fat. body fat have,
secrete hormone called leptin, L-E-P-T-I-N, leptin body fat, leptin
goes brain suppresses appetite. body brain signaling mechanism
says, look, enough, not incidentally, leptin signaling disrupted people
bulimia obesity certain forms binge eating disorder. So, system
disrupted enough signal enough body fat
don't need eat right here, sort voice body fat, trying talk
brain, signal, dialogue mixed messed up. cases
absent entirely. So, body fat signaling brain much reserve
have. sort like savings account energy, 'cause body fat is.
got lipids lipolysis, can metabolized. interested
process, increase it.

00:46:17 Fat, Leptin & Fertility & Metabolic Dysfunctions Obesity

just generally works. can see episode science fat loss.


body fat something else really interesting relates anorexia,
sufficient levels body fat leptin circulating blood. leptin signal gets
brain, hypothalamus pituitary gland register signal.
completely subconscious way, trigger deployment eggs females
production sperm males. So, body fat stores low, reason
periods shut off sperm production reduced even shut off not
enough leptin getting hypothalamus pituitary. shut off
signals, hormones, things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, hormones. So, don't remember
names don't want travel ovary testes cause ovary
testes ovulate produce sperm. So, reason anorexic stopped
periods, stopped cycling, isn't sufficient leptin
bloodstream. Now attempts give leptin anorexics leptin
sequenced peptide synthesized. can inject leptin
people. studies done that, happens, not
tend alleviate anorexia, not cause people start eating again.
actually makes sense leptin also way shutting off hunger signals
saying, body fats way saying, hey, lot body fat here,
sufficient body fat. doesn't even lot, has, cases
shown rescue menstrual, cycling anorexics, okay? So, body fat
signaling brain. gut signaling brain. neurons gut
primarily responding meaning fire electrical signals.
sufficient fatty acids coming fats ingest, amino acids coming proteins
ingest sugars coming carbohydrates sugars. Things like fructose, glucose,
et cetera. signals sent fat gut brain.
therefore body multiple signals directing toward eating eating
less. So, got two categories neurons. One acts accelerator,
AgRP neuron saying, eat, eat, get excited eat. category
neurons. POMC neurons suppressing hunger. acting like
break, body informing brain time status body
whether not needs food not. So, might ask people
overweight lot body fat, continue eat lot, well past
certain threshold body fat start getting so-called metabolic
disorders, blood glucose metabolism disrupted, leptin signaling disrupted


sorts changes brain side body end things,
hungry, despite fact body plenty energy reserve. Okay,
think sufficient explain basics hunger satiety kind biological
mechanism. important thing again, remember mechanical
chemical signals come fullness absence fullness come
presence glucose blood absence glucose blood.
haven't eaten long time, glucagon levels go up, instance, GLP1 levels go
will drive seek food want food. signals
coming body fat neurons gut. So, lot convergence,
lot pathways. don't offer pathways confuse you. offer
pathways clarify extent something simple eating decision
not eat complicated. perhaps heard, certainly heard that, oh, know,
takes 20 minutes satiety set in, eat slowly won't
realize full 20 minutes. actually not true. don't know
got started, probably chew food better

00:50:30 Overeat

eat slowly, mindful eating, et cetera. So, anticipation

not hundreds thousands years, see mice, see humans,
similar types pathways effects. human beings plenty fat

energy, hungry, eat all. seems like just
shouldn't happen. important, think clear intuitive way
framing stuff around eating motivated behaviors can go


awry, not just eating disorders, us. Basically said was,
evolutionary standpoint, makes sense eat often can, much
can, fast can. Well, sounds crazy. told eat not
often, not much, eat slowly chew food. Dr. Halpern pointed out,
circuits brain reward eating often eating fast cramming much
food possible. purely evolutionary standpoint, food
scarce, seeking food dangerous, whether not animal sources
not. always competitive, grew families lot

little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related

01:24:06 Habit-Reward Circuits Flipped Anorexics: Reward Deprivation

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit
depth. part set circuits involved called go no-go
tasks. don't want go lot detail right now, take us
far rabbit hole neurocircuitry. basically terms behaviors,

another aspect behavior, select behaviors perform.
select behaviors suppress. anorexic brain seems reward

even hyper-focus consumption low fat, low calorie foods. So, homeostatic

leading habit? little bit similar way somebody


suffers addiction starts put different constraint type behaviors, constraint type

start able notice things happening, can start
intervene. So, talk things lead habit,
turn exact points entry changing eliminating rewiring habits,
healthy behaviors. highlight isn't just rewiring
habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal
anorexic. might familiar this. kind uncomfortable around.
Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,
around. notice push food around plate lot. become
masterful actually trying keep people's awareness away doing,
hone low fat, low calorie foods. can't seem set shift.
can't just relax enjoy meal, meal essentially like
Waldo find face coffee tasked. constantly
monitoring much people observing trying navigate this.
otherwise really pleasant circumstance people trying navigate
remember them, reward avoidance certain things

amazing. frankly also important findings teach anorexics,
happening them, this, able intervene. Now
need support, right? another form therapy seems work well anorexics
ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based
models starting surface lot now various therapy settings, therapy based
models short basically entire family made aware individual's
challenges particular eating disorder disorder. understanding
biology psychology around it, stopped condemning individual.
start support individual queuing towards habits
observe. give autonomy. realize none changes
overnight, taught things like neuroplasticity ability change
one's brain response experience. whole internal support network.


Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia
quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported
therapeutic environment can help people rewire brain, can get relief
major depression various forms trauma. now eating disorders also
explored context MDMA siliciden clinical trials. want
emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails
compounds. People telling amazing experiences
relief various things, not just eating disorders, depression, et cetera. However,
get equal number emails people saying worked self

now experiencing chronic visual, snow. getting genuine visual field deficits.
havering ticks never before, chronic insomnia. So,
not passing judgment compounds people sort
thing. just want see clinical data. believe wait
clinical trials done people start approaching stuff.
serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff
done regularly too. gotten reports back people so-
called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human
knowledge knowledge can allow make better decisions. say again,
beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining
weight, don't constantly treadmill, no pun intended
balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-
exercise induced thermogenesis people tend thin, tend bounce
around lot. kind fidgety burns 1000 calories day, anywhere
800 2000 calories day. Now can beneficial folks
overweight healthy mindset food, trying lose weight.
turns by, literally fidgeting bouncing around, like,
this. looks ridiculous. actually burn lot body fat calories. way provide


caloric deficit, burn body fat body fat not just passive
tissue. actually receives input neurons release noradrenaline adrenaline.
neat. described several decades now. actually pretty
terrific way burn off calories. So, anorexic, actually want
encourage not constantly trying burn off calories. can
challenging. So, shifting toward activities like weight bearing activities resistance
training promote

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode
depression, talked powerful aspect major depression,
anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe
statements feelings behaviors start reflect lie. not
conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic
suffering sort disorder. just means human
cares appear world. not judge case
anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self
image much don't actually see accurately, visual
perceptions off. reason know this, really important
beautiful studies done colleague, Jeremy Bailenson's lab
Stanford, department communications, actually collaborated Dr.
Halpern mentioned earlier. really interesting studies


give us window perceptual defect anorexics have. actually done one
experiments. fortunate not anorexic, done work
VR lab there. get get adjust avatar

perception reality. So, indeed seem case now
relieving, say encouraging therapies
talked family based model, Connie behavioral treatments. Yes,
drug treatments well. habit intervention model one starts shift
things, appear perception self seems follow
perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning
don't change easily. Whereas appears circuitry related habit
formation, decision-making reward, circuitry, stuff can rewired.
anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need
eat. doesn't seem work. just don't see way
see them. offer point consideration, know someone
anorexic, look anorexic think, still critical
small, even nonexistent amount body fat triceps something?
that? Well, literally brain, relates perceptions, visual perceptions
particular, completely off.

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,

common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar

think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing

indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see

bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just
pump brakes little bit, no break, right? So, start going faster
faster faster. choice use accelerator just coach it.
essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern
others, think really exciting. even though highly invasive, think going
lead not just relief patients get deep brain stimulation,
also identification sorts receptors present brain areas.
help. means understand brain areas involved
disorder, understand receptors, brain areas express,
can start additional interventions way non invasive treatments, things like
drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral
interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

bulimics, doesn't hold up. look data, many, many meta analysis
done. just simply not case. instances, anorexia
bulimia, clear biological underpinnings, driving under-eating
overeating. So, going talk biology eating overeating
appropriate levels eating. that, will start identify
mechanisms serve entry points treatment anorexia bulimia.
probably aware, anorexia bulimia can comorbid,
can exist one another. anorexics will binge purge order
maintain unhealthily low weight. bulimics fit psychological
criteria anorexia. lot overlap two categories. Now
talk categorization second categorization led now
bunch eating disorders defined psychiatric community. One
classic symptoms anorexia loss menstrual cycles, loss periods.
reason body undernourished, body fat stores, send signals
brain inform body undernourished, turn off signals say,
look, enough body fat cells support healthy metabolism.
therefore shut ovulation, literally signal sent fat muscle
brain brain, hypothalamus pituitary will send signals ovaries,
will turn off signals heading ovaries deploy eggs, maturation
eggs follicle, et cetera. So, instances people anorexia
bulimia, still maintaining healthy menstrual cycles

00:37:35 Binge Eating Disorders, EDNOS, OSFEDS, Pica

least menstrual cycles. led whole set categorizations
eating disorders, like binge eating disorder, tends lot overeating,
not purging categorizations anorexia, people feeding,
not losing periods. number different names
acronyms. include things like, EDNOS, EDNOS eating disorder, not
otherwise specified. So, sub categorization OSFEDs. So, OSFEDs
specified feeding eating disorder. So, right now, look online
looking psychiatric psychological textbooks, find
huge constellation eating disorders today. mainly going talk anorexia,
bulimia, binge eating disorder body dysmorphia. can even find eating disorders


like pica, people actually ingest things like dirt rocks metal
genuine appetite things. certainly not recommend sampling
non food items. foods, incredibly dangerous. People often poisoned
themselves. often can cause structural blockages people died
sorts things. nonetheless, aspects brain biology
disrupted can lead bizarre types eating behavior, sometimes pica
caused malnutrition, not always. today going focus
prevalent eating disorders, going build toward understanding
looking healthy metabolism eating satiety hunger looks like.
one, realized not everyone eating disorder. two,
want people understand relationship think, decisions
take eat body brain subconscious levels
driving behaviors healthy otherwise. think can lead
us better understanding healthy eating us,

00:39:44 Hunger? Satiety?

increase compassion hopefully even increased improvement treatment
eating disorders suffering them. So, hunger
satiety? Satiety, course sated feeling like enough food. want
remind people basic mechanisms brain body communicate.
vitally important, not just discussion, discussion,
think, behave, feel, body communicating two types information
brain regular basis, particular around feeding, two types
information mechanical information, chemical information. mean
mechanical information? Well, take deep breath, oh, hold breath,
find can hold breath lot longer exhale air
hold breath lungs empty. reason not
lungs full, enough oxygen therefore can hold breath.
lungs full, particular class neurons called baroreceptors,
send information brain say, pressure lungs. means
probably oxygen here. trigger breathe actually suppressed,
lungs empty. Even plenty oxygen system,
baroreceptors send different signal brain, no oxygen


breathe. impulse breathe comes earlier. Likewise,
stomach full, sends signals brain purely based mechanical
fullness, nothing nutrients, says full. therefore don't
hungry. Don't motivate find ingest food. Whereas gut empty, even
plenty nutrients plenty body fat stores, tend focus food bit more.
So, volume mechanical influences profound effect think.
consider not doing, likewise chemical effects. ingest food,
so-called blood sugar blood glucose levels go up. information signaled
brain via neuronal pathways hormonal pathways. particular,
neurons within gut, signal areas brain stem involved satiety
sense enough

00:42:00 Neuronal & Hormonal “Accelerators & Brakes” Eating

food system. So, chemical information. So, hunger
feeding satiety regulated way mechanical chemical signaling. have,
have, neurons hypothalamus trigger eating neurons
trigger cessation stopping eating. accelerator eating
break. covered lot detail episode feeding metabolism
hunger. So, want lot detail, see episode, right now, just
going give top contour works. hypothalamus area
forebrain, tells front, base forebrain sits
less roof mouth. hypothalamus contains lots different
kinds neurons, including neurons stimulate sexual activity desire, regulate
body temperature control appetite ceasing eating appetite.
two types neurons within particular area hypothalamus relevant
here. so-called POMC neurons, okay? Pro-opiomelanocortin neurons
tend act break appetite, way another hormone called
melanocytes stimulating hormone. not incidentally getting lot
sunlight viewing lot sunlight, system ramped up.
appetite lower summer months winter months. true
animals. true humans. class neurons called AgRP
neurons. AgRP neurons ones stimulate feeding, create sort
anxiety excitement food, can positive anxiety, can negative


anxiety. mean that? Well, ever seen kids heading get ice cream,
absolutely excited. see people getting raised, sit eat big meal.
excited eat. Sometimes due social factors, increase
overall levels autonomic arousal. depending context, can feel
excited anxious, ramping energy. AgRP neurons
caused that, fact much eliminate kill neurons,
done experimental mouse models laboratory, also humans
lesions neurotoxic effects AgRP neurons. find
don't want eat. essentially become anorexic, meaning don't want
ingest food. no appetite food whatsoever. Now not exactly
anorexia is, AgRP neurons like accelerator wanting eat. Whereas
stimulate AgRP neurons humans say small tumor near
AgRP neurons, become hyperphagic. will eat point bursting,
animals humans elevated levels AgRP neurons anxious.
want eat, will ingest food point override
mechanical chemical signals body. know sounds horrible,
horrible. will eat point burst. Now, signals coming back
body inform brain presence different levels nutrients.
generally comes three sources. First all, body fat. body fat have,
secrete hormone called leptin, L-E-P-T-I-N, leptin body fat, leptin
goes brain suppresses appetite. body brain signaling mechanism
says, look, enough, not incidentally, leptin signaling disrupted people
bulimia obesity certain forms binge eating disorder. So, system
disrupted enough signal enough body fat
don't need eat right here, sort voice body fat, trying talk
brain, signal, dialogue mixed messed up. cases
absent entirely. So, body fat signaling brain much reserve
have. sort like savings account energy, 'cause body fat is.
got lipids lipolysis, can metabolized. interested
process, increase it.

00:46:17 Fat, Leptin & Fertility & Metabolic Dysfunctions Obesity

just generally works. can see episode science fat loss.


body fat something else really interesting relates anorexia,
sufficient levels body fat leptin circulating blood. leptin signal gets
brain, hypothalamus pituitary gland register signal.
completely subconscious way, trigger deployment eggs females
production sperm males. So, body fat stores low, reason
periods shut off sperm production reduced even shut off not
enough leptin getting hypothalamus pituitary. shut off
signals, hormones, things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, hormones. So, don't remember
names don't want travel ovary testes cause ovary
testes ovulate produce sperm. So, reason anorexic stopped
periods, stopped cycling, isn't sufficient leptin
bloodstream. Now attempts give leptin anorexics leptin
sequenced peptide synthesized. can inject leptin
people. studies done that, happens, not
tend alleviate anorexia, not cause people start eating again.
actually makes sense leptin also way shutting off hunger signals
saying, body fats way saying, hey, lot body fat here,
sufficient body fat. doesn't even lot, has, cases
shown rescue menstrual, cycling anorexics, okay? So, body fat
signaling brain. gut signaling brain. neurons gut
primarily responding meaning fire electrical signals.
sufficient fatty acids coming fats ingest, amino acids coming proteins
ingest sugars coming carbohydrates sugars. Things like fructose, glucose,
et cetera. signals sent fat gut brain.
therefore body multiple signals directing toward eating eating
less. So, got two categories neurons. One acts accelerator,
AgRP neuron saying, eat, eat, get excited eat. category
neurons. POMC neurons suppressing hunger. acting like
break, body informing brain time status body
whether not needs food not. So, might ask people
overweight lot body fat, continue eat lot, well past
certain threshold body fat start getting so-called metabolic
disorders, blood glucose metabolism disrupted, leptin signaling disrupted


sorts changes brain side body end things,
hungry, despite fact body plenty energy reserve. Okay,
think sufficient explain basics hunger satiety kind biological
mechanism. important thing again, remember mechanical
chemical signals come fullness absence fullness come
presence glucose blood absence glucose blood.
haven't eaten long time, glucagon levels go up, instance, GLP1 levels go
will drive seek food want food. signals
coming body fat neurons gut. So, lot convergence,
lot pathways. don't offer pathways confuse you. offer
pathways clarify extent something simple eating decision
not eat complicated. perhaps heard, certainly heard that, oh, know,
takes 20 minutes satiety set in, eat slowly won't
realize full 20 minutes. actually not true. don't know
got started, probably chew food better

00:50:30 Overeat

eat slowly, mindful eating, et cetera. So, anticipation
episode, consulted extensively colleague mine Stanford, sadly
us going off University Pennsylvania. So, losses University
Pennsylvania's win. name Dr. Casey Halpern. MD, Medical Doctor
Neurosurgeon, PhD studies binge-eating disorder types eating
disorders arise brain. developed really pioneering
treatments them. talk work little bit later episode,
got discussion body sufficient energy levels desire eat
all. not just case binge eating disorder bulimia,
case. know, primitive biology evolved many tens.
not hundreds thousands years, see mice, see humans,
similar types pathways effects. human beings plenty fat
reserve plenty glycogen liver, et cetera. words, plenty
energy, hungry, eat all. seems like just
shouldn't happen. important, think clear intuitive way
framing stuff around eating motivated behaviors can go


awry, not just eating disorders, us. Basically said was,
evolutionary standpoint, makes sense eat often can, much
can, fast can. Well, sounds crazy. told eat not
often, not much, eat slowly chew food. Dr. Halpern pointed out,
circuits brain reward eating often eating fast cramming much
food possible. purely evolutionary standpoint, food
scarce, seeking food dangerous, whether not animal sources
not. always competitive, grew families lot
siblings. may resonate you. just one sibling, competitive
certain things, typically not competitive food, friends lot
siblings. really interesting see food served taken
households. like food hit table just absolute war
portions got much got slightly bigger piece cake, et
cetera, turned frequent happening meals birthday
parties, whereas children perhaps used food presented
without compete members species. Every animal,
including humans hardwired circuit born pays attention
much food available, much getting now much likely
get future. without going rabbit hole arcuate nucleus biology,
two sentences, hypothalamic area called arcuate nucleus.
fascinating area. actually area houses, PMOC neurons
types neurons regulate hunger satiety. neurons
arcuate nucleus start getting active. see food think food, drive
hunger, drive hunger way responsive food looks like,
smells like, also prior history interactions food. takes
account social context, whether not going get whole pizza
whether not going others going
compete with. So, lot signals arcuate nucleus brain
paying attention to. So, Dr. Halpern pointed actually accelerator
increases level awareness anxiety sort constricts field
view senses. Anytime interact food driving primitive reflex
ingest much food can, quickly can, move there,
presumably elsewhere. So, changed way think
eating behavior eating disorders. fact, think eating disorders like


bulimia unmasking mechanism without so-called top-down control,
without mechanisms use regulate behavior. indeed bulimia
binge-eating disorder closely associated impulsivity impulsive
behaviors kinds, something also will discuss more. pathway?
work?

00:55:30 Homeostasis & Reward Systems/Decisions

Dr. Halpern colleagues order try treat things like binge
eating disorder? Well, can frame behavior, good decision making bad
decision-making. pretty simple box diagram model. realized many
listening this, not watching this. no diagram look at. just explain
can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,
one box, okay? eat that. shouldn't eat that. wait dinner.
shouldn't wait dinner. actually another box, okay?
Now true behaviors, say something want say something,
don't, shouldn't say something, anyway. knowledge
kind looping head. homework. go run. shouldn't
right now. shouldn't social media, kinds shoulds
shouldn'ts circulating head. one box. actually
do. behavior, whether not suppress behavior, turn off phone
go read book go sleep whether not stay night, stay
another hour, even five minutes. two boxes two intervening
forces. intervening forces critically important. intervening forces
homeostatic processes, called processes, thing, homeostatic processes,
regulate balance different systems body, hot cold, awake
asleep, dopamine desire pursue things, serotonin desire just relax
chill. So, homeostatic processes reward systems. now move
discussion anorexia, bulimia specifically, see anorexia
bulimia not breaking mindset one shouldn't do.
disruption homeostatic reward processes, decision-making
completely disrupted. many cases not available anorexic bulimic.
Now, don't want abstract here. saying person starves
point might die cases, sadly die. can


know perfectly well behavior leading bad outcomes possibly even
death. yet not able intervene unless get particular clinical help,
homeostatic processes, signals body brain say,
need food. aren't registering way individuals.
bulimic person suffers binge eating disorder. don't
necessarily want eat food. simply cannot help it. like reflex them,
homeostatic processes reward processes associated food,
can't intervene X, Y, Z, shouldn't X, Y,
Z. actual behavior is. Now, isn't just biological mechanistic
explanation summarized two sentences. is,
roadmap interventions can really make difference. So, talk
different drug based interventions behavioral interventions social interventions,
like think whether not interventions breaking into, tapping
box thinking, sort pattern thinking around food, whether not
behavior, actual ingestion restriction food, whether not tapping
homeostatic process, balance energy systems kind getting enough,
not much, tapping reward system. just little teaser
headed, find based data clinical data experiments done
carefully well excellent groups. find anorexics
sort switch flipped, decision-making actually pretty darn
good. might even better terms evaluating food, nutritional content,
habits disrupted. So, not even consciously aware fact
making terrible. cases, dangerous food choices,

00:59:58 Anorexia

turns habits. way build break rebuild new habits
one effective treatments anorexia. So, now talk anorexia,
failure consume enough energy, individuals risk death, not
death, severe metabolic disorders, lack bone density, et cetera. mentioned
earlier, anorexia things almost certainly were, anorexia
described early 1600s. maybe even earlier, records
saints, 1400s people refuse ingest food. Another common myth
anorexia sort thing see rich societies. spoiled


children much food decide going focus slim
are, look bathing suits, et cetera, not true. careful analysis medical
epidemiology shown find anorexia even cultures societies
food scarce. So, really speaks biological mechanism. Now hard unveil
societies food scarce, lot people starving hungry,
individuals choose still avoid food seem sort
reward mechanism rewards them, makes feel better don't eat,
despite fact body severely depleted nutrients. So,
interesting points disruption biological mechanism. Now,
want make sure emphasizing not favor people, particular
young children, adolescents, teenagers bombarded unrealistic imagery
bodies. idea cause of, amplifying anorexia, data just
don't seem support that, anorexia classic sense, requires
endocrine, meaning hormonal disruption, menstrual abnormalities, lack sperm
production, low testosterone males, order meet classification anorexia.
mentioned earlier, now nuanced new classifications anorexia
even individuals still menstruate maintain sperm production
anorexia, can still considered clinically diagnosable disorder. Now, typically
anorexia starts adolescence, right around puberty. take look puberty is.
Puberty broad level significant dramatic developmental step.
Anyone goes lifespan. body changes, brain changes,
perceptions, change, one's self perception, changes. changes
driven changes circuitry within hypothalamus. So, neurons
controlling production so-called sex steroid hormones, things like testosterone,
estrogen, related hormones, prolactin, et cetera. changing
rapid rates. Anorexia tends show around time subset individuals
face seem find food, aversive, now purely psychological theory
fighting autonomy. want control. Puberty also time
children parents tug war control. small child
told go bed sent room. Now child can talk back say,
don't want to, refuse to. happens lot various households, sure
familiar with. Adolescence puberty also girls start menstruating
typically, boys develop deeper voice, start producing sperm, et cetera. So,
lot bodily changes also drive perceptual changes perceptual changes


drive bodily changes. dramatic shift young girl boy doesn't
nourish sufficiently. period, number downstream
negative effects. list them, just subset effects,
hypogonadism. lack sperm production healthy egg production.
amenorrhea, lack menstrual cycling, okay? So, failure

interesting implications sake cholesterol hypothesis anorexics
ingest little food often cosmically high levels cholesterol, including LDL, low

anorexics consume little food. often cosmically high levels

hypothesis cholesterol see blood panel due eat.
explanation conditions not sufficient cholesterol

purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward

turn exact points entry changing eliminating rewiring habits,
healthy behaviors. highlight isn't just rewiring
habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal
anorexic. might familiar this. kind uncomfortable around.
Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,

masterful actually trying keep people's awareness away doing,
hone low fat, low calorie foods. can't seem set shift.
can't just relax enjoy meal, meal essentially like

amazing. frankly also important findings teach anorexics,
happening them, this, able intervene. Now
need support, right? another form therapy seems work well anorexics
ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based
models starting surface lot now various therapy settings, therapy based
models short basically entire family made aware individual's
challenges particular eating disorder disorder. understanding
biology psychology around it, stopped condemning individual.
start support individual queuing towards habits
observe. give autonomy. realize none changes
overnight, taught things like neuroplasticity ability change
one's brain response experience. whole internal support network.


Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia
quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported
therapeutic environment can help people rewire brain, can get relief
major depression various forms trauma. now eating disorders also
explored context MDMA siliciden clinical trials. want
emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails
compounds. People telling amazing experiences
relief various things, not just eating disorders, depression, et cetera. However,
get equal number emails people saying worked self

now experiencing chronic visual, snow. getting genuine visual field deficits.

not passing judgment compounds people sort

clinical trials done people start approaching stuff.
serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff

called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human

beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining
weight, don't constantly treadmill, no pun intended
balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-
exercise induced thermogenesis people tend thin, tend bounce
around lot. kind fidgety burns 1000 calories day, anywhere
800 2000 calories day. Now can beneficial folks
overweight healthy mindset food, trying lose weight.

terrific way burn off calories. So, anorexic, actually want
encourage not constantly trying burn off calories. can
challenging. So, shifting toward activities like weight bearing activities resistance
training promote

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode

anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe

conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic

somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning

anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar
prefrontal cortex. probably know prefrontal cortex ever
wanted to, just episode, prefrontal cortex involved analysis duration
path outcome. Duration path outcome avoid impulsivity.
think. Okay, this, that, that, this, can imagine obsessive
compulsive anorexic, circuits overactive. bulimic
circuit going essentially underactive conditions
think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing
cupboards ordering food. feeling horrible
themselves. tend cycles binge purge followed
feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young
adult. So, really polar opposite see anorexia. So, lack
impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper
limbic hypothalamic circuitry, things sort. Anytime feel like want
say something really offensive don't, top-down control.
prefrontal cortex. Anytime someone says something like grow teeth.
'Cause know shouldn't say anything, gritting teeth top-dow control,
okay? explode burst say wrong thing, say thing
shouldn't say thing shouldn't do, lack prefrontal control.
indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called
adrenergic, norepinephrine levels brain allow top-down control.
also used treat ADHD attention deficit disorder. tend

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,

accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin

individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral

utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just
pump brakes little bit, no break, right? So, start going faster
faster faster. choice use accelerator just coach it.
essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern

also identification sorts receptors present brain areas.

disorder, understand receptors, brain areas express,
can start additional interventions way non invasive treatments, things like
drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral
interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

looking healthy metabolism eating satiety hunger looks like.
one, realized not everyone eating disorder. two,
want people understand relationship think, decisions
take eat body brain subconscious levels
driving behaviors healthy otherwise. think can lead
us better understanding healthy eating us,

00:39:44 Hunger? Satiety?

increase compassion hopefully even increased improvement treatment
eating disorders suffering them. So, hunger
satiety? Satiety, course sated feeling like enough food. want
remind people basic mechanisms brain body communicate.
vitally important, not just discussion, discussion,
think, behave, feel, body communicating two types information
brain regular basis, particular around feeding, two types
information mechanical information, chemical information. mean
mechanical information? Well, take deep breath, oh, hold breath,
find can hold breath lot longer exhale air
hold breath lungs empty. reason not
lungs full, enough oxygen therefore can hold breath.
lungs full, particular class neurons called baroreceptors,
send information brain say, pressure lungs. means
probably oxygen here. trigger breathe actually suppressed,
lungs empty. Even plenty oxygen system,
baroreceptors send different signal brain, no oxygen


breathe. impulse breathe comes earlier. Likewise,
stomach full, sends signals brain purely based mechanical
fullness, nothing nutrients, says full. therefore don't
hungry. Don't motivate find ingest food. Whereas gut empty, even
plenty nutrients plenty body fat stores, tend focus food bit more.
So, volume mechanical influences profound effect think.
consider not doing, likewise chemical effects. ingest food,
so-called blood sugar blood glucose levels go up. information signaled
brain via neuronal pathways hormonal pathways. particular,
neurons within gut, signal areas brain stem involved satiety
sense enough

00:42:00 Neuronal & Hormonal “Accelerators & Brakes” Eating

food system. So, chemical information. So, hunger
feeding satiety regulated way mechanical chemical signaling. have,
have, neurons hypothalamus trigger eating neurons
trigger cessation stopping eating. accelerator eating
break. covered lot detail episode feeding metabolism
hunger. So, want lot detail, see episode, right now, just
going give top contour works. hypothalamus area
forebrain, tells front, base forebrain sits
less roof mouth. hypothalamus contains lots different
kinds neurons, including neurons stimulate sexual activity desire, regulate
body temperature control appetite ceasing eating appetite.
two types neurons within particular area hypothalamus relevant
here. so-called POMC neurons, okay? Pro-opiomelanocortin neurons
tend act break appetite, way another hormone called
melanocytes stimulating hormone. not incidentally getting lot
sunlight viewing lot sunlight, system ramped up.
appetite lower summer months winter months. true
animals. true humans. class neurons called AgRP
neurons. AgRP neurons ones stimulate feeding, create sort
anxiety excitement food, can positive anxiety, can negative


anxiety. mean that? Well, ever seen kids heading get ice cream,
absolutely excited. see people getting raised, sit eat big meal.
excited eat. Sometimes due social factors, increase
overall levels autonomic arousal. depending context, can feel
excited anxious, ramping energy. AgRP neurons
caused that, fact much eliminate kill neurons,
done experimental mouse models laboratory, also humans
lesions neurotoxic effects AgRP neurons. find
don't want eat. essentially become anorexic, meaning don't want
ingest food. no appetite food whatsoever. Now not exactly
anorexia is, AgRP neurons like accelerator wanting eat. Whereas
stimulate AgRP neurons humans say small tumor near
AgRP neurons, become hyperphagic. will eat point bursting,
animals humans elevated levels AgRP neurons anxious.
want eat, will ingest food point override
mechanical chemical signals body. know sounds horrible,
horrible. will eat point burst. Now, signals coming back
body inform brain presence different levels nutrients.
generally comes three sources. First all, body fat. body fat have,
secrete hormone called leptin, L-E-P-T-I-N, leptin body fat, leptin
goes brain suppresses appetite. body brain signaling mechanism
says, look, enough, not incidentally, leptin signaling disrupted people
bulimia obesity certain forms binge eating disorder. So, system
disrupted enough signal enough body fat
don't need eat right here, sort voice body fat, trying talk
brain, signal, dialogue mixed messed up. cases
absent entirely. So, body fat signaling brain much reserve
have. sort like savings account energy, 'cause body fat is.
got lipids lipolysis, can metabolized. interested
process, increase it.

00:46:17 Fat, Leptin & Fertility & Metabolic Dysfunctions Obesity

just generally works. can see episode science fat loss.


body fat something else really interesting relates anorexia,
sufficient levels body fat leptin circulating blood. leptin signal gets
brain, hypothalamus pituitary gland register signal.
completely subconscious way, trigger deployment eggs females
production sperm males. So, body fat stores low, reason
periods shut off sperm production reduced even shut off not
enough leptin getting hypothalamus pituitary. shut off
signals, hormones, things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, hormones. So, don't remember
names don't want travel ovary testes cause ovary
testes ovulate produce sperm. So, reason anorexic stopped
periods, stopped cycling, isn't sufficient leptin
bloodstream. Now attempts give leptin anorexics leptin
sequenced peptide synthesized. can inject leptin
people. studies done that, happens, not
tend alleviate anorexia, not cause people start eating again.
actually makes sense leptin also way shutting off hunger signals
saying, body fats way saying, hey, lot body fat here,
sufficient body fat. doesn't even lot, has, cases
shown rescue menstrual, cycling anorexics, okay? So, body fat
signaling brain. gut signaling brain. neurons gut
primarily responding meaning fire electrical signals.
sufficient fatty acids coming fats ingest, amino acids coming proteins
ingest sugars coming carbohydrates sugars. Things like fructose, glucose,
et cetera. signals sent fat gut brain.
therefore body multiple signals directing toward eating eating
less. So, got two categories neurons. One acts accelerator,
AgRP neuron saying, eat, eat, get excited eat. category
neurons. POMC neurons suppressing hunger. acting like
break, body informing brain time status body
whether not needs food not. So, might ask people
overweight lot body fat, continue eat lot, well past
certain threshold body fat start getting so-called metabolic
disorders, blood glucose metabolism disrupted, leptin signaling disrupted


sorts changes brain side body end things,
hungry, despite fact body plenty energy reserve. Okay,
think sufficient explain basics hunger satiety kind biological
mechanism. important thing again, remember mechanical
chemical signals come fullness absence fullness come
presence glucose blood absence glucose blood.
haven't eaten long time, glucagon levels go up, instance, GLP1 levels go
will drive seek food want food. signals
coming body fat neurons gut. So, lot convergence,
lot pathways. don't offer pathways confuse you. offer
pathways clarify extent something simple eating decision
not eat complicated. perhaps heard, certainly heard that, oh, know,
takes 20 minutes satiety set in, eat slowly won't
realize full 20 minutes. actually not true. don't know
got started, probably chew food better

00:50:30 Overeat

eat slowly, mindful eating, et cetera. So, anticipation
episode, consulted extensively colleague mine Stanford, sadly
us going off University Pennsylvania. So, losses University
Pennsylvania's win. name Dr. Casey Halpern. MD, Medical Doctor
Neurosurgeon, PhD studies binge-eating disorder types eating
disorders arise brain. developed really pioneering
treatments them. talk work little bit later episode,
got discussion body sufficient energy levels desire eat
all. not just case binge eating disorder bulimia,
case. know, primitive biology evolved many tens.
not hundreds thousands years, see mice, see humans,
similar types pathways effects. human beings plenty fat
reserve plenty glycogen liver, et cetera. words, plenty
energy, hungry, eat all. seems like just
shouldn't happen. important, think clear intuitive way
framing stuff around eating motivated behaviors can go


awry, not just eating disorders, us. Basically said was,
evolutionary standpoint, makes sense eat often can, much
can, fast can. Well, sounds crazy. told eat not
often, not much, eat slowly chew food. Dr. Halpern pointed out,
circuits brain reward eating often eating fast cramming much
food possible. purely evolutionary standpoint, food
scarce, seeking food dangerous, whether not animal sources
not. always competitive, grew families lot
siblings. may resonate you. just one sibling, competitive
certain things, typically not competitive food, friends lot
siblings. really interesting see food served taken
households. like food hit table just absolute war
portions got much got slightly bigger piece cake, et
cetera, turned frequent happening meals birthday
parties, whereas children perhaps used food presented
without compete members species. Every animal,
including humans hardwired circuit born pays attention
much food available, much getting now much likely
get future. without going rabbit hole arcuate nucleus biology,
two sentences, hypothalamic area called arcuate nucleus.
fascinating area. actually area houses, PMOC neurons
types neurons regulate hunger satiety. neurons
arcuate nucleus start getting active. see food think food, drive
hunger, drive hunger way responsive food looks like,
smells like, also prior history interactions food. takes
account social context, whether not going get whole pizza
whether not going others going

paying attention to. So, Dr. Halpern pointed actually accelerator
increases level awareness anxiety sort constricts field
view senses. Anytime interact food driving primitive reflex
ingest much food can, quickly can, move there,
presumably elsewhere. So, changed way think
eating behavior eating disorders. fact, think eating disorders like


bulimia unmasking mechanism without so-called top-down control,
without mechanisms use regulate behavior. indeed bulimia
binge-eating disorder closely associated impulsivity impulsive
behaviors kinds, something also will discuss more. pathway?
work?

00:55:30 Homeostasis & Reward Systems/Decisions

Dr. Halpern colleagues order try treat things like binge
eating disorder? Well, can frame behavior, good decision making bad
decision-making. pretty simple box diagram model. realized many
listening this, not watching this. no diagram look at. just explain
can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,
one box, okay? eat that. shouldn't eat that. wait dinner.
shouldn't wait dinner. actually another box, okay?
Now true behaviors, say something want say something,
don't, shouldn't say something, anyway. knowledge
kind looping head. homework. go run. shouldn't
right now. shouldn't social media, kinds shoulds
shouldn'ts circulating head. one box. actually
do. behavior, whether not suppress behavior, turn off phone
go read book go sleep whether not stay night, stay
another hour, even five minutes. two boxes two intervening
forces. intervening forces critically important. intervening forces
homeostatic processes, called processes, thing, homeostatic processes,
regulate balance different systems body, hot cold, awake
asleep, dopamine desire pursue things, serotonin desire just relax
chill. So, homeostatic processes reward systems. now move
discussion anorexia, bulimia specifically, see anorexia
bulimia not breaking mindset one shouldn't do.
disruption homeostatic reward processes, decision-making
completely disrupted. many cases not available anorexic bulimic.
Now, don't want abstract here. saying person starves
point might die cases, sadly die. can


know perfectly well behavior leading bad outcomes possibly even
death. yet not able intervene unless get particular clinical help,
homeostatic processes, signals body brain say,
need food. aren't registering way individuals.
bulimic person suffers binge eating disorder. don't
necessarily want eat food. simply cannot help it. like reflex them,
homeostatic processes reward processes associated food,
can't intervene X, Y, Z, shouldn't X, Y,
Z. actual behavior is. Now, isn't just biological mechanistic
explanation summarized two sentences. is,
roadmap interventions can really make difference. So, talk
different drug based interventions behavioral interventions social interventions,
like think whether not interventions breaking into, tapping
box thinking, sort pattern thinking around food, whether not
behavior, actual ingestion restriction food, whether not tapping
homeostatic process, balance energy systems kind getting enough,
not much, tapping reward system. just little teaser
headed, find based data clinical data experiments done
carefully well excellent groups. find anorexics
sort switch flipped, decision-making actually pretty darn
good. might even better terms evaluating food, nutritional content,
habits disrupted. So, not even consciously aware fact
making terrible. cases, dangerous food choices,

00:59:58 Anorexia

turns habits. way build break rebuild new habits
one effective treatments anorexia. So, now talk anorexia,
failure consume enough energy, individuals risk death, not
death, severe metabolic disorders, lack bone density, et cetera. mentioned
earlier, anorexia things almost certainly were, anorexia
described early 1600s. maybe even earlier, records
saints, 1400s people refuse ingest food. Another common myth
anorexia sort thing see rich societies. spoiled


children much food decide going focus slim
are, look bathing suits, et cetera, not true. careful analysis medical
epidemiology shown find anorexia even cultures societies
food scarce. So, really speaks biological mechanism. Now hard unveil
societies food scarce, lot people starving hungry,
individuals choose still avoid food seem sort
reward mechanism rewards them, makes feel better don't eat,
despite fact body severely depleted nutrients. So,
interesting points disruption biological mechanism. Now,
want make sure emphasizing not favor people, particular
young children, adolescents, teenagers bombarded unrealistic imagery
bodies. idea cause of, amplifying anorexia, data just
don't seem support that, anorexia classic sense, requires
endocrine, meaning hormonal disruption, menstrual abnormalities, lack sperm
production, low testosterone males, order meet classification anorexia.
mentioned earlier, now nuanced new classifications anorexia
even individuals still menstruate maintain sperm production
anorexia, can still considered clinically diagnosable disorder. Now, typically
anorexia starts adolescence, right around puberty. take look puberty is.
Puberty broad level significant dramatic developmental step.
Anyone goes lifespan. body changes, brain changes,
perceptions, change, one's self perception, changes. changes
driven changes circuitry within hypothalamus. So, neurons

answers not intuitive all. least surprising.

Meaning disruption one major chemical systems brain
makes anorexics anorexic therefore, can replace chemical? can
reduce chemical essentially eliminate anorexia? answer not really
sort maybe no, why, lot different chemicals brain body,
category chemicals particularly important listened

many categories drugs emphasize serotonergic circuitry, meaning
cause release of, efficiency serotonin brain body. Things like
Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, things variety. drugs used degree
success. Although not much treat things like anorexia nervosa. make


sense, drugs increase serotonin, general effect increase
serotonin, will lower anxiety. sounds like great thing. lot anorexics
really anxious around food. talk why, lowering anxiety might think
lead ingestion food, not often happens, increasing serotonin,
way drug regimen will tend make one less hungry,
heightened levels serotonin blood brain, isn't desire go seek
things will raise serotonin own. Now, anorexics well
benefit serotonergic drugs, drugs increase activity

reward based decision-making, drive pursue particular food drive
perform particular task, lot throughout day,
controlled brain area called ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Let simplify
little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related
behaviors. So, instance, want get particular grade exam, want
learn something, want complete workout. want go grocery store
pick stuff head home. going think duration. long
have, okay, 45 minutes get store? long take get
store path? way going drive there? way going navigate
grocery store, outcome, able get get items need get


home time, okay? DPO, duration path outcome. conscious process.
tend take account different criteria related preventing
accomplishing want helping assisting you. So,
course, get checkout line grocery store, going select
shortest line instance. So, DPO stuff. requires decision-making
reward-based, use DPO type processes short term pick groceries
pick line grocery store decide trajectory take home.
use navigating long extended processes life, trying get degree raise
children get particularly challenging year, et cetera. So, duration path
outcome, entire process relies fore brain. prefrontal cortex,
prefrontal cortex allows take information memory, combine
information happening present context, direct
behavior, speech, et cetera, toward particular outcomes. sounds like
mouthful, is, metabolically demanding, decision-making metabolically
demanding. takes effort, okay? Reflexes hand, don't involve prefrontal
cortex way, habits reflexes. Like know walk, get
walk, don't think right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot.
just it. doesn't rely prefrontal cortex. subconscious sometimes
called, basically don't use parts brain involved
duration path outcome type analysis. Okay, so, particular study,
examined brain activity anorexics selecting different foods.
mentioned earlier, hyper acuity awareness foods contain

01:24:06 Habit-Reward Circuits Flipped Anorexics: Reward Deprivation

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit
depth. part set circuits involved called go no-go
tasks. don't want go lot detail right now, take us
far rabbit hole neurocircuitry. basically terms behaviors,
DPO type behaviors. So, decision-making, reward based behaviors.
habits learn acquire. just start reflexively, things like

another aspect behavior, select behaviors perform.
select behaviors suppress. anorexic brain seems reward

01:28:30 Break Habit?

going work intervening neural circuitry. related habit

rewire brain circuitry literally causing reflex? case causing
reflex killing individual, least leading bad health outcomes.
way cognitive mechanism teach individual,
leading habit? little bit similar way somebody


suffers addiction starts put different constraint type behaviors, constraint type

turn exact points entry changing eliminating rewiring habits,
healthy behaviors. highlight isn't just rewiring
habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal

Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,

masterful actually trying keep people's awareness away doing,
hone low fat, low calorie foods. can't seem set shift.
can't just relax enjoy meal, meal essentially like

amazing. frankly also important findings teach anorexics,
happening them, this, able intervene. Now
need support, right? another form therapy seems work well anorexics
ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based
models starting surface lot now various therapy settings, therapy based
models short basically entire family made aware individual's
challenges particular eating disorder disorder. understanding
biology psychology around it, stopped condemning individual.
start support individual queuing towards habits
observe. give autonomy. realize none changes
overnight, taught things like neuroplasticity ability change
one's brain response experience. whole internal support network.


Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia
quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported
therapeutic environment can help people rewire brain, can get relief
major depression various forms trauma. now eating disorders also
explored context MDMA siliciden clinical trials. want
emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails
compounds. People telling amazing experiences
relief various things, not just eating disorders, depression, et cetera. However,
get equal number emails people saying worked self

now experiencing chronic visual, snow. getting genuine visual field deficits.
havering ticks never before, chronic insomnia. So,
not passing judgment compounds people sort
thing. just want see clinical data. believe wait
clinical trials done people start approaching stuff.
serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff
done regularly too. gotten reports back people so-
called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human
knowledge knowledge can allow make better decisions. say again,
beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-

neat. described several decades now. actually pretty
terrific way burn off calories. So, anorexic, actually want
encourage not constantly trying burn off calories. can
challenging. So, shifting toward activities like weight bearing activities resistance
training promote

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode
depression, talked powerful aspect major depression,
anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe
statements feelings behaviors start reflect lie. not
conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic
suffering sort disorder. just means human
cares appear world. not judge case
anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self
image much don't actually see accurately, visual
perceptions off. reason know this, really important
beautiful studies done colleague, Jeremy Bailenson's lab
Stanford, department communications, actually collaborated Dr.
Halpern mentioned earlier. really interesting studies


give us window perceptual defect anorexics have. actually done one
experiments. fortunate not anorexic, done work
VR lab there. get get adjust avatar

distort avatar. words, create serious mismatch
perception reality. So, indeed seem case now
relieving, say encouraging therapies
talked family based model, Connie behavioral treatments. Yes,
drug treatments well. habit intervention model one starts shift
things, appear perception self seems follow
perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning
don't change easily. Whereas appears circuitry related habit
formation, decision-making reward, circuitry, stuff can rewired.
anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need
eat. doesn't seem work. just don't see way
see them. offer point consideration, know someone
anorexic, look anorexic think, still critical
small, even nonexistent amount body fat triceps something?
that? Well, literally brain, relates perceptions, visual perceptions
particular, completely off.

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar
prefrontal cortex. probably know prefrontal cortex ever
wanted to, just episode, prefrontal cortex involved analysis duration
path outcome. Duration path outcome avoid impulsivity.
think. Okay, this, that, that, this, can imagine obsessive
compulsive anorexic, circuits overactive. bulimic
circuit going essentially underactive conditions
think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing
cupboards ordering food. feeling horrible
themselves. tend cycles binge purge followed
feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young
adult. So, really polar opposite see anorexia. So, lack
impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper
limbic hypothalamic circuitry, things sort. Anytime feel like want
say something really offensive don't, top-down control.
prefrontal cortex. Anytime someone says something like grow teeth.
'Cause know shouldn't say anything, gritting teeth top-dow control,
okay? explode burst say wrong thing, say thing
shouldn't say thing shouldn't do, lack prefrontal control.
indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called
adrenergic, norepinephrine levels brain allow top-down control.
also used treat ADHD attention deficit disorder. tend


create hyper-focus. tend push brain into, drugs tend create

think this, that, this, that, anticipating outcomes.
reason, drugs like Wellbutrin, bupropion, antidepressant, mainly

psychiatrist order get prescribed prescription drugs,

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just
pump brakes little bit, no break, right? So, start going faster
faster faster. choice use accelerator just coach it.
essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern
others, think really exciting. even though highly invasive, think going
lead not just relief patients get deep brain stimulation,
also identification sorts receptors present brain areas.
help. means understand brain areas involved
disorder, understand receptors, brain areas express,
can start additional interventions way non invasive treatments, things like
drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral
interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat

fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

breathe. impulse breathe comes earlier. Likewise,
stomach full, sends signals brain purely based mechanical
fullness, nothing nutrients, says full. therefore don't

plenty nutrients plenty body fat stores, tend focus food bit more.
So, volume mechanical influences profound effect think.
consider not doing, likewise chemical effects. ingest food,
so-called blood sugar blood glucose levels go up. information signaled

going give top contour works. hypothalamus area
forebrain, tells front, base forebrain sits
less roof mouth. hypothalamus contains lots different
kinds neurons, including neurons stimulate sexual activity desire, regulate
body temperature control appetite ceasing eating appetite.
two types neurons within particular area hypothalamus relevant
here. so-called POMC neurons, okay? Pro-opiomelanocortin neurons
tend act break appetite, way another hormone called
melanocytes stimulating hormone. not incidentally getting lot

appetite lower summer months winter months. true
animals. true humans. class neurons called AgRP
neurons. AgRP neurons ones stimulate feeding, create sort
anxiety excitement food, can positive anxiety, can negative


anxiety. mean that? Well, ever seen kids heading get ice cream,
absolutely excited. see people getting raised, sit eat big meal.
excited eat. Sometimes due social factors, increase
overall levels autonomic arousal. depending context, can feel
excited anxious, ramping energy. AgRP neurons
caused that, fact much eliminate kill neurons,
done experimental mouse models laboratory, also humans
lesions neurotoxic effects AgRP neurons. find
don't want eat. essentially become anorexic, meaning don't want
ingest food. no appetite food whatsoever. Now not exactly
anorexia is, AgRP neurons like accelerator wanting eat. Whereas
stimulate AgRP neurons humans say small tumor near
AgRP neurons, become hyperphagic. will eat point bursting,
animals humans elevated levels AgRP neurons anxious.
want eat, will ingest food point override
mechanical chemical signals body. know sounds horrible,
horrible. will eat point burst. Now, signals coming back
body inform brain presence different levels nutrients.
generally comes three sources. First all, body fat. body fat have,
secrete hormone called leptin, L-E-P-T-I-N, leptin body fat, leptin
goes brain suppresses appetite. body brain signaling mechanism
says, look, enough, not incidentally, leptin signaling disrupted people
bulimia obesity certain forms binge eating disorder. So, system
disrupted enough signal enough body fat
don't need eat right here, sort voice body fat, trying talk
brain, signal, dialogue mixed messed up. cases
absent entirely. So, body fat signaling brain much reserve
have. sort like savings account energy, 'cause body fat is.
got lipids lipolysis, can metabolized. interested
process, increase it.

00:46:17 Fat, Leptin & Fertility & Metabolic Dysfunctions Obesity

just generally works. can see episode science fat loss.


body fat something else really interesting relates anorexia,
sufficient levels body fat leptin circulating blood. leptin signal gets
brain, hypothalamus pituitary gland register signal.
completely subconscious way, trigger deployment eggs females
production sperm males. So, body fat stores low, reason
periods shut off sperm production reduced even shut off not
enough leptin getting hypothalamus pituitary. shut off
signals, hormones, things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, hormones. So, don't remember
names don't want travel ovary testes cause ovary
testes ovulate produce sperm. So, reason anorexic stopped
periods, stopped cycling, isn't sufficient leptin
bloodstream. Now attempts give leptin anorexics leptin
sequenced peptide synthesized. can inject leptin
people. studies done that, happens, not
tend alleviate anorexia, not cause people start eating again.
actually makes sense leptin also way shutting off hunger signals
saying, body fats way saying, hey, lot body fat here,
sufficient body fat. doesn't even lot, has, cases
shown rescue menstrual, cycling anorexics, okay? So, body fat
signaling brain. gut signaling brain. neurons gut
primarily responding meaning fire electrical signals.
sufficient fatty acids coming fats ingest, amino acids coming proteins
ingest sugars coming carbohydrates sugars. Things like fructose, glucose,
et cetera. signals sent fat gut brain.
therefore body multiple signals directing toward eating eating
less. So, got two categories neurons. One acts accelerator,
AgRP neuron saying, eat, eat, get excited eat. category
neurons. POMC neurons suppressing hunger. acting like
break, body informing brain time status body
whether not needs food not. So, might ask people
overweight lot body fat, continue eat lot, well past
certain threshold body fat start getting so-called metabolic
disorders, blood glucose metabolism disrupted, leptin signaling disrupted


sorts changes brain side body end things,
hungry, despite fact body plenty energy reserve. Okay,
think sufficient explain basics hunger satiety kind biological
mechanism. important thing again, remember mechanical
chemical signals come fullness absence fullness come
presence glucose blood absence glucose blood.
haven't eaten long time, glucagon levels go up, instance, GLP1 levels go
will drive seek food want food. signals
coming body fat neurons gut. So, lot convergence,
lot pathways. don't offer pathways confuse you. offer
pathways clarify extent something simple eating decision
not eat complicated. perhaps heard, certainly heard that, oh, know,
takes 20 minutes satiety set in, eat slowly won't
realize full 20 minutes. actually not true. don't know
got started, probably chew food better

00:50:30 Overeat

eat slowly, mindful eating, et cetera. So, anticipation
episode, consulted extensively colleague mine Stanford, sadly
us going off University Pennsylvania. So, losses University
Pennsylvania's win. name Dr. Casey Halpern. MD, Medical Doctor
Neurosurgeon, PhD studies binge-eating disorder types eating
disorders arise brain. developed really pioneering
treatments them. talk work little bit later episode,
got discussion body sufficient energy levels desire eat
all. not just case binge eating disorder bulimia,
case. know, primitive biology evolved many tens.
not hundreds thousands years, see mice, see humans,
similar types pathways effects. human beings plenty fat
reserve plenty glycogen liver, et cetera. words, plenty
energy, hungry, eat all. seems like just
shouldn't happen. important, think clear intuitive way
framing stuff around eating motivated behaviors can go


awry, not just eating disorders, us. Basically said was,
evolutionary standpoint, makes sense eat often can, much
can, fast can. Well, sounds crazy. told eat not
often, not much, eat slowly chew food. Dr. Halpern pointed out,
circuits brain reward eating often eating fast cramming much
food possible. purely evolutionary standpoint, food
scarce, seeking food dangerous, whether not animal sources
not. always competitive, grew families lot
siblings. may resonate you. just one sibling, competitive
certain things, typically not competitive food, friends lot
siblings. really interesting see food served taken
households. like food hit table just absolute war
portions got much got slightly bigger piece cake, et
cetera, turned frequent happening meals birthday
parties, whereas children perhaps used food presented
without compete members species. Every animal,
including humans hardwired circuit born pays attention
much food available, much getting now much likely
get future. without going rabbit hole arcuate nucleus biology,
two sentences, hypothalamic area called arcuate nucleus.
fascinating area. actually area houses, PMOC neurons
types neurons regulate hunger satiety. neurons
arcuate nucleus start getting active. see food think food, drive
hunger, drive hunger way responsive food looks like,
smells like, also prior history interactions food. takes
account social context, whether not going get whole pizza
whether not going others going
compete with. So, lot signals arcuate nucleus brain
paying attention to. So, Dr. Halpern pointed actually accelerator
increases level awareness anxiety sort constricts field
view senses. Anytime interact food driving primitive reflex
ingest much food can, quickly can, move there,
presumably elsewhere. So, changed way think
eating behavior eating disorders. fact, think eating disorders like


bulimia unmasking mechanism without so-called top-down control,
without mechanisms use regulate behavior. indeed bulimia
binge-eating disorder closely associated impulsivity impulsive
behaviors kinds, something also will discuss more. pathway?
work?

00:55:30 Homeostasis & Reward Systems/Decisions

Dr. Halpern colleagues order try treat things like binge
eating disorder? Well, can frame behavior, good decision making bad
decision-making. pretty simple box diagram model. realized many
listening this, not watching this. no diagram look at. just explain
can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,
one box, okay? eat that. shouldn't eat that. wait dinner.
shouldn't wait dinner. actually another box, okay?
Now true behaviors, say something want say something,
don't, shouldn't say something, anyway. knowledge
kind looping head. homework. go run. shouldn't
right now. shouldn't social media, kinds shoulds
shouldn'ts circulating head. one box. actually
do. behavior, whether not suppress behavior, turn off phone
go read book go sleep whether not stay night, stay
another hour, even five minutes. two boxes two intervening
forces. intervening forces critically important. intervening forces
homeostatic processes, called processes, thing, homeostatic processes,
regulate balance different systems body, hot cold, awake
asleep, dopamine desire pursue things, serotonin desire just relax
chill. So, homeostatic processes reward systems. now move
discussion anorexia, bulimia specifically, see anorexia
bulimia not breaking mindset one shouldn't do.
disruption homeostatic reward processes, decision-making
completely disrupted. many cases not available anorexic bulimic.
Now, don't want abstract here. saying person starves
point might die cases, sadly die. can


know perfectly well behavior leading bad outcomes possibly even
death. yet not able intervene unless get particular clinical help,
homeostatic processes, signals body brain say,
need food. aren't registering way individuals.
bulimic person suffers binge eating disorder. don't
necessarily want eat food. simply cannot help it. like reflex them,
homeostatic processes reward processes associated food,
can't intervene X, Y, Z, shouldn't X, Y,
Z. actual behavior is. Now, isn't just biological mechanistic
explanation summarized two sentences. is,
roadmap interventions can really make difference. So, talk
different drug based interventions behavioral interventions social interventions,
like think whether not interventions breaking into, tapping
box thinking, sort pattern thinking around food, whether not
behavior, actual ingestion restriction food, whether not tapping
homeostatic process, balance energy systems kind getting enough,
not much, tapping reward system. just little teaser
headed, find based data clinical data experiments done
carefully well excellent groups. find anorexics
sort switch flipped, decision-making actually pretty darn
good. might even better terms evaluating food, nutritional content,
habits disrupted. So, not even consciously aware fact
making terrible. cases, dangerous food choices,

00:59:58 Anorexia

turns habits. way build break rebuild new habits
one effective treatments anorexia. So, now talk anorexia,
failure consume enough energy, individuals risk death, not
death, severe metabolic disorders, lack bone density, et cetera. mentioned
earlier, anorexia things almost certainly were, anorexia
described early 1600s. maybe even earlier, records
saints, 1400s people refuse ingest food. Another common myth
anorexia sort thing see rich societies. spoiled


children much food decide going focus slim
are, look bathing suits, et cetera, not true. careful analysis medical
epidemiology shown find anorexia even cultures societies
food scarce. So, really speaks biological mechanism. Now hard unveil
societies food scarce, lot people starving hungry,
individuals choose still avoid food seem sort
reward mechanism rewards them, makes feel better don't eat,
despite fact body severely depleted nutrients. So,
interesting points disruption biological mechanism. Now,
want make sure emphasizing not favor people, particular
young children, adolescents, teenagers bombarded unrealistic imagery
bodies. idea cause of, amplifying anorexia, data just
don't seem support that, anorexia classic sense, requires
endocrine, meaning hormonal disruption, menstrual abnormalities, lack sperm
production, low testosterone males, order meet classification anorexia.
mentioned earlier, now nuanced new classifications anorexia
even individuals still menstruate maintain sperm production
anorexia, can still considered clinically diagnosable disorder. Now, typically
anorexia starts adolescence, right around puberty. take look puberty is.
Puberty broad level significant dramatic developmental step.
Anyone goes lifespan. body changes, brain changes,
perceptions, change, one's self perception, changes. changes
driven changes circuitry within hypothalamus. So, neurons
controlling production so-called sex steroid hormones, things like testosterone,
estrogen, related hormones, prolactin, et cetera. changing
rapid rates. Anorexia tends show around time subset individuals
face seem find food, aversive, now purely psychological theory
fighting autonomy. want control. Puberty also time
children parents tug war control. small child
told go bed sent room. Now child can talk back say,
don't want to, refuse to. happens lot various households, sure
familiar with. Adolescence puberty also girls start menstruating
typically, boys develop deeper voice, start producing sperm, et cetera. So,
lot bodily changes also drive perceptual changes perceptual changes


drive bodily changes. dramatic shift young girl boy doesn't
nourish sufficiently. period, number downstream

01:06:13 Psychological vs. Biological/Genetic Factors Anorexia



picture indeed bleak picture. So, ask can done

way food restriction used reward household, right? making up,
can imagine hypothetical scenario just say mother
particular individual vocal avoidance food. seen before,

child genetic predisposition, right? never think genes terms

01:09:44 Chemical Imbalances, Serotonergic Treatments

answers not intuitive all. least surprising.
remiss didn't start obvious, is, chemical defect?
Meaning disruption one major chemical systems brain
makes anorexics anorexic therefore, can replace chemical? can
reduce chemical essentially eliminate anorexia? answer not really
sort maybe no, why, lot different chemicals brain body,
category chemicals particularly important listened
podcast before, even haven't going come
again, category chemicals brain body called
neuromodulators, neuromodulators different neuro-transmitters sense
neuromodulators modulator change activity brain areas neural circuits,
can think microphones held particular sets
connections brain make connections brain, likely
active relative others, okay? make louder speak, many
neuromodulators, ones important sake today's discussion
classic ones, dopamine, acetylcholine, epinephrin serotonin. focus
serotonin. Serotonin neuromodulator tends increase activity certain
neural circuits, including within hypothalamus, also within body trigger
sense satiety, enough, enough food, enough warmth, enough social
connection, enough motivated goal drive type thing behavior
one want of, serotonin tends make circuits quiet down. Now,
many categories drugs emphasize serotonergic circuitry, meaning
cause release of, efficiency serotonin brain body. Things like
Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, things variety. drugs used degree
success. Although not much treat things like anorexia nervosa. make


sense, drugs increase serotonin, general effect increase
serotonin, will lower anxiety. sounds like great thing. lot anorexics
really anxious around food. talk why, lowering anxiety might think
lead ingestion food, not often happens, increasing serotonin,
way drug regimen will tend make one less hungry,
heightened levels serotonin blood brain, isn't desire go seek
things will raise serotonin own. Now, anorexics well
benefit serotonergic drugs, drugs increase activity
circuits leads satiety. think major goal treating

01:12:56 Altered Habits & Rewards Anorexia: Hyperacuity Fat Content

anorexic get hunger, appetite. So, now want focus
work done around habits behaviors anorexics,
turned ideal places intervention. work
describe done Dr. Joanna Steinglass colleagues Columbia University
New York. groups well. course, type work,
think really beautiful experiments beautiful
explorations potential treatments anorexics. seemed quite high
degree effectiveness applied correctly. First all, challenge
studying anorexia anorexia, essentially studying
absence behavior. hard study absence behavior, opposed
behavior. So, experiments anorexics, giving gallery
pictures different foods, allowing anorexia patients arrange foods,
according preference select, food, nutrient content
caloric content. essentially asked anorexics evaluate food,
so, able identify something unique anorexics level
perception food. found anorexics, rather anxious
presence food, anxiety driving avoidance food. found
anorexics hyper acuity, hyper awareness fat content foods, almost
point sort fat content savant. Now don't necessarily know
this. not looking avocado thinking, okay, X number
grams fat rather, looking apple saying, okay, no fat. start
less reflexively. Now well-known symptom anorexia, especially


young anorexics kind obsession food, caloric contents,
macronutrient ratios, meaning fat protein carbohydrate ratios. know caloric
numbers, sort pass information memory system brain
allows interactions food, reflexive way actively
avoiding high-fat content, foods, calorie rich foods, defaulting towards low
calorie foods. eat. Now, might seem like almost trivial result
face it, think, okay, don't like eat eat. eat low calorie,
low fat foods, duh, way subconsciously
learn information pass off reflexive habit.
important means need look processes
brain, brain areas, chemicals drive decision-making knowledge.
also need look areas brain drive habit formation habit execution,

habit reflexive. mosquito bite leg, scratch it.
didn't necessarily even think, oh, going scratch that. fact, just take little bit
moment respites talk habits general, beautiful study
done Caltech University, looking parking lot people park

01:18:28 Brain Areas Reward Based Decision Making vs. Habits

best point intervention. So, Dr. Steinglass colleagues did,
took anorexics course control groups put FMRI
scanner, brain scanners allow evaluate brain areas
active, particular tasks. one scanners,
actually, know, actually one things. biting
bite bar time scanners immobile. So,
looking things TV screen. Sometimes can press buttons select
choices forth, can't really eat within things. found
reward based decision-making, drive pursue particular food drive
perform particular task, lot throughout day,
controlled brain area called ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Let simplify
little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related
behaviors. So, instance, want get particular grade exam, want
learn something, want complete workout. want go grocery store
pick stuff head home. going think duration. long
have, okay, 45 minutes get store? long take get
store path? way going drive there? way going navigate
grocery store, outcome, able get get items need get


home time, okay? DPO, duration path outcome. conscious process.
tend take account different criteria related preventing
accomplishing want helping assisting you. So,
course, get checkout line grocery store, going select
shortest line instance. So, DPO stuff. requires decision-making
reward-based, use DPO type processes short term pick groceries
pick line grocery store decide trajectory take home.
use navigating long extended processes life, trying get degree raise
children get particularly challenging year, et cetera. So, duration path
outcome, entire process relies fore brain. prefrontal cortex,
prefrontal cortex allows take information memory, combine
information happening present context, direct
behavior, speech, et cetera, toward particular outcomes. sounds like
mouthful, is, metabolically demanding, decision-making metabolically
demanding. takes effort, okay? Reflexes hand, don't involve prefrontal
cortex way, habits reflexes. Like know walk, get
walk, don't think right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot.
just it. doesn't rely prefrontal cortex. subconscious sometimes
called, basically don't use parts brain involved
duration path outcome type analysis. Okay, so, particular study,
examined brain activity anorexics selecting different foods.
mentioned earlier, hyper acuity awareness foods contain
less calories foods fat content particular foods is,

sorts brain areas active task done. found really
interesting, found dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex not surprisingly
involved decision-making evaluation food, foods going

anorexics framework okay eat not okay eat much.
However, areas brain active decision-making
process. brain areas turn drive habit avoiding
particular foods approaching foods. case, wasn't dorsolateral

striatum big area brain. involved lot different things. includes areas


like caudate putamen. just want mention, throw
names, not need remember names different structures.
just there, interested level detail, basically brain area
anorexics brain area involved evaluating decision-making

01:24:06 Habit-Reward Circuits Flipped Anorexics: Reward Deprivation

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit
depth. part set circuits involved called go no-go
tasks. don't want go lot detail right now, take us
far rabbit hole neurocircuitry. basically terms behaviors,
DPO type behaviors. So, decision-making, reward based behaviors.
habits learn acquire. just start reflexively, things like
walking, things like yawning tired, things like taking particular route
parking lot, right? learned first time go given parking lot walk


building. that, tend follow exact trajectory becomes
automatized. just like, just without thinking. Well, go no-go circuitry
another aspect behavior, select behaviors perform.
select behaviors suppress. anorexic brain seems reward
suppression one set behaviors, ingestion high calorie foods, reward focus,
even hyper-focus consumption low fat, low calorie foods. So, homeostatic
process learn like high school onward, that, oh, everything
body designed keep everything balance. stay awake certain amount
time. want sleep, don't eat while. want eat maintain
weight, right? eat much. want eat less. systems

says place intervene habit. stuff already passed
learning, passed reward systems. clearly not

Clearly, overriding homeostatic processes, signals say

just performing habits rewarded it. So, come along
say, look, really eat whole pie whole pizza feel better.
aversive them. So, since appears habit, reflex perpetuating

01:28:30 Break Habit?

going work intervening neural circuitry. related habit

rewire brain circuitry literally causing reflex? case causing
reflex killing individual, least leading bad health outcomes.
way cognitive mechanism teach individual,
leading habit? little bit similar way somebody


suffers addiction starts put different constraint type behaviors, constraint type
behaviors, sorts things like alcoholic will call hotel ahead time
say, listen, want mini bar taken room. don't want television
room, et cetera, constraint type behaviors. really ways keeping oneself
temptation. habits, work subconscious level.
seems work best combination teaching individual internal
state register internal state. call interoception ability
perceive internal state, can start learn, associate interactions
different types food, sorts cues occurring within body,
quickening heart rate, hyper acuity focus talked earlier.
start able notice things happening, can start
intervene. So, talk things lead habit,
turn exact points entry changing eliminating rewiring habits,
healthy behaviors. highlight isn't just rewiring
habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal
anorexic. might familiar this. kind uncomfortable around.
Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,
around. notice push food around plate lot. become
masterful actually trying keep people's awareness away doing,
hone low fat, low calorie foods. can't seem set shift.
can't just relax enjoy meal, meal essentially like
Waldo find face coffee tasked. constantly
monitoring much people observing trying navigate this.
otherwise really pleasant circumstance people trying navigate
remember them, reward avoidance certain things

clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard

pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human

beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make

overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly

distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just

way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode
depression, talked powerful aspect major depression,
anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe

conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic
suffering sort disorder. just means human
cares appear world. not judge case
anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self
image much don't actually see accurately, visual

beautiful studies done colleague, Jeremy Bailenson's lab
Stanford, department communications, actually collaborated Dr.
Halpern mentioned earlier. really interesting studies


give us window perceptual defect anorexics have. actually done one

talked family based model, Connie behavioral treatments. Yes,
drug treatments well. habit intervention model one starts shift
things, appear perception self seems follow
perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning
don't change easily. Whereas appears circuitry related habit
formation, decision-making reward, circuitry, stuff can rewired.
anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need
eat. doesn't seem work. just don't see way
see them. offer point consideration, know someone
anorexic, look anorexic think, still critical
small, even nonexistent amount body fat triceps something?
that? Well, literally brain, relates perceptions, visual perceptions
particular, completely off.

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar

think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing
cupboards ordering food. feeling horrible

feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young

impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper
limbic hypothalamic circuitry, things sort. Anytime feel like want

indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called
adrenergic, norepinephrine levels brain allow top-down control.
also used treat ADHD attention deficit disorder. tend

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain

invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion

So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry

world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy

good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel

this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area

Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing

question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not

body fat something else really interesting relates anorexia,

follicle-stimulating hormone, hormones. So, don't remember
names don't want travel ovary testes cause ovary
testes ovulate produce sperm. So, reason anorexic stopped
periods, stopped cycling, isn't sufficient leptin
bloodstream. Now attempts give leptin anorexics leptin
sequenced peptide synthesized. can inject leptin
people. studies done that, happens, not
tend alleviate anorexia, not cause people start eating again.
actually makes sense leptin also way shutting off hunger signals
saying, body fats way saying, hey, lot body fat here,
sufficient body fat. doesn't even lot, has, cases

sufficient fatty acids coming fats ingest, amino acids coming proteins

therefore body multiple signals directing toward eating eating

01:24:06 Habit-Reward Circuits Flipped Anorexics: Reward Deprivation

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit

another aspect behavior, select behaviors perform.
select behaviors suppress. anorexic brain seems reward

turn exact points entry changing eliminating rewiring habits,
healthy behaviors. highlight isn't just rewiring
habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal
anorexic. might familiar this. kind uncomfortable around.
Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,

masterful actually trying keep people's awareness away doing,
hone low fat, low calorie foods. can't seem set shift.
can't just relax enjoy meal, meal essentially like
Waldo find face coffee tasked. constantly

otherwise really pleasant circumstance people trying navigate
remember them, reward avoidance certain things

amazing. frankly also important findings teach anorexics,
happening them, this, able intervene. Now
need support, right? another form therapy seems work well anorexics
ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based
models starting surface lot now various therapy settings, therapy based
models short basically entire family made aware individual's
challenges particular eating disorder disorder. understanding
biology psychology around it, stopped condemning individual.
start support individual queuing towards habits
observe. give autonomy. realize none changes
overnight, taught things like neuroplasticity ability change
one's brain response experience. whole internal support network.


Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia
quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported
therapeutic environment can help people rewire brain, can get relief

emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails

get equal number emails people saying worked self

not passing judgment compounds people sort

clinical trials done people start approaching stuff.
serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff

called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human
knowledge knowledge can allow make better decisions. say again,
beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining
weight, don't constantly treadmill, no pun intended
balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-
exercise induced thermogenesis people tend thin, tend bounce
around lot. kind fidgety burns 1000 calories day, anywhere
800 2000 calories day. Now can beneficial folks
overweight healthy mindset food, trying lose weight.
turns by, literally fidgeting bouncing around, like,
this. looks ridiculous. actually burn lot body fat calories. way provide


caloric deficit, burn body fat body fat not just passive

neat. described several decades now. actually pretty
terrific way burn off calories. So, anorexic, actually want
encourage not constantly trying burn off calories. can
challenging. So, shifting toward activities like weight bearing activities resistance
training promote

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode
depression, talked powerful aspect major depression,
anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe
statements feelings behaviors start reflect lie. not
conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic
suffering sort disorder. just means human
cares appear world. not judge case
anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self
image much don't actually see accurately, visual

beautiful studies done colleague, Jeremy Bailenson's lab

give us window perceptual defect anorexics have. actually done one

relieving, say encouraging therapies
talked family based model, Connie behavioral treatments. Yes,
drug treatments well. habit intervention model one starts shift
things, appear perception self seems follow
perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning
don't change easily. Whereas appears circuitry related habit
formation, decision-making reward, circuitry, stuff can rewired.
anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need
eat. doesn't seem work. just don't see way
see them. offer point consideration, know someone

small, even nonexistent amount body fat triceps something?
that? Well, literally brain, relates perceptions, visual perceptions

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid

So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just
pump brakes little bit, no break, right? So, start going faster
faster faster. choice use accelerator just coach it.
essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern
others, think really exciting. even though highly invasive, think going
lead not just relief patients get deep brain stimulation,
also identification sorts receptors present brain areas.

can start additional interventions way non invasive treatments, things like
drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral
interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

body fat something else really interesting relates anorexia,
sufficient levels body fat leptin circulating blood. leptin signal gets
brain, hypothalamus pituitary gland register signal.
completely subconscious way, trigger deployment eggs females
production sperm males. So, body fat stores low, reason
periods shut off sperm production reduced even shut off not
enough leptin getting hypothalamus pituitary. shut off
signals, hormones, things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, hormones. So, don't remember
names don't want travel ovary testes cause ovary
testes ovulate produce sperm. So, reason anorexic stopped
periods, stopped cycling, isn't sufficient leptin
bloodstream. Now attempts give leptin anorexics leptin
sequenced peptide synthesized. can inject leptin
people. studies done that, happens, not
tend alleviate anorexia, not cause people start eating again.
actually makes sense leptin also way shutting off hunger signals
saying, body fats way saying, hey, lot body fat here,
sufficient body fat. doesn't even lot, has, cases
shown rescue menstrual, cycling anorexics, okay? So, body fat
signaling brain. gut signaling brain. neurons gut
primarily responding meaning fire electrical signals.
sufficient fatty acids coming fats ingest, amino acids coming proteins
ingest sugars coming carbohydrates sugars. Things like fructose, glucose,
et cetera. signals sent fat gut brain.
therefore body multiple signals directing toward eating eating
less. So, got two categories neurons. One acts accelerator,
AgRP neuron saying, eat, eat, get excited eat. category
neurons. POMC neurons suppressing hunger. acting like
break, body informing brain time status body
whether not needs food not. So, might ask people
overweight lot body fat, continue eat lot, well past
certain threshold body fat start getting so-called metabolic
disorders, blood glucose metabolism disrupted, leptin signaling disrupted


sorts changes brain side body end things,
hungry, despite fact body plenty energy reserve. Okay,
think sufficient explain basics hunger satiety kind biological
mechanism. important thing again, remember mechanical
chemical signals come fullness absence fullness come
presence glucose blood absence glucose blood.
haven't eaten long time, glucagon levels go up, instance, GLP1 levels go

coming body fat neurons gut. So, lot convergence,
lot pathways. don't offer pathways confuse you. offer
pathways clarify extent something simple eating decision
not eat complicated. perhaps heard, certainly heard that, oh, know,
takes 20 minutes satiety set in, eat slowly won't
realize full 20 minutes. actually not true. don't know
got started, probably chew food better

00:50:30 Overeat

eat slowly, mindful eating, et cetera. So, anticipation
episode, consulted extensively colleague mine Stanford, sadly
us going off University Pennsylvania. So, losses University
Pennsylvania's win. name Dr. Casey Halpern. MD, Medical Doctor
Neurosurgeon, PhD studies binge-eating disorder types eating
disorders arise brain. developed really pioneering
treatments them. talk work little bit later episode,
got discussion body sufficient energy levels desire eat
all. not just case binge eating disorder bulimia,
case. know, primitive biology evolved many tens.
not hundreds thousands years, see mice, see humans,
similar types pathways effects. human beings plenty fat
reserve plenty glycogen liver, et cetera. words, plenty
energy, hungry, eat all. seems like just
shouldn't happen. important, think clear intuitive way
framing stuff around eating motivated behaviors can go


awry, not just eating disorders, us. Basically said was,
evolutionary standpoint, makes sense eat often can, much
can, fast can. Well, sounds crazy. told eat not
often, not much, eat slowly chew food. Dr. Halpern pointed out,
circuits brain reward eating often eating fast cramming much
food possible. purely evolutionary standpoint, food
scarce, seeking food dangerous, whether not animal sources
not. always competitive, grew families lot
siblings. may resonate you. just one sibling, competitive
certain things, typically not competitive food, friends lot
siblings. really interesting see food served taken
households. like food hit table just absolute war

bulimia unmasking mechanism without so-called top-down control,
without mechanisms use regulate behavior. indeed bulimia
binge-eating disorder closely associated impulsivity impulsive
behaviors kinds, something also will discuss more. pathway?
work?

00:55:30 Homeostasis & Reward Systems/Decisions

Dr. Halpern colleagues order try treat things like binge
eating disorder? Well, can frame behavior, good decision making bad
decision-making. pretty simple box diagram model. realized many
listening this, not watching this. no diagram look at. just explain
can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,
one box, okay? eat that. shouldn't eat that. wait dinner.
shouldn't wait dinner. actually another box, okay?
Now true behaviors, say something want say something,
don't, shouldn't say something, anyway. knowledge
kind looping head. homework. go run. shouldn't
right now. shouldn't social media, kinds shoulds
shouldn'ts circulating head. one box. actually
do. behavior, whether not suppress behavior, turn off phone
go read book go sleep whether not stay night, stay
another hour, even five minutes. two boxes two intervening
forces. intervening forces critically important. intervening forces
homeostatic processes, called processes, thing, homeostatic processes,
regulate balance different systems body, hot cold, awake
asleep, dopamine desire pursue things, serotonin desire just relax
chill. So, homeostatic processes reward systems. now move
discussion anorexia, bulimia specifically, see anorexia
bulimia not breaking mindset one shouldn't do.
disruption homeostatic reward processes, decision-making
completely disrupted. many cases not available anorexic bulimic.
Now, don't want abstract here. saying person starves
point might die cases, sadly die. can


know perfectly well behavior leading bad outcomes possibly even
death. yet not able intervene unless get particular clinical help,
homeostatic processes, signals body brain say,
need food. aren't registering way individuals.
bulimic person suffers binge eating disorder. don't
necessarily want eat food. simply cannot help it. like reflex them,
homeostatic processes reward processes associated food,
can't intervene X, Y, Z, shouldn't X, Y,
Z. actual behavior is. Now, isn't just biological mechanistic
explanation summarized two sentences. is,
roadmap interventions can really make difference. So, talk
different drug based interventions behavioral interventions social interventions,
like think whether not interventions breaking into, tapping
box thinking, sort pattern thinking around food, whether not
behavior, actual ingestion restriction food, whether not tapping
homeostatic process, balance energy systems kind getting enough,
not much, tapping reward system. just little teaser
headed, find based data clinical data experiments done
carefully well excellent groups. find anorexics
sort switch flipped, decision-making actually pretty darn
good. might even better terms evaluating food, nutritional content,
habits disrupted. So, not even consciously aware fact
making terrible. cases, dangerous food choices,

00:59:58 Anorexia

turns habits. way build break rebuild new habits
one effective treatments anorexia. So, now talk anorexia,
failure consume enough energy, individuals risk death, not
death, severe metabolic disorders, lack bone density, et cetera. mentioned
earlier, anorexia things almost certainly were, anorexia
described early 1600s. maybe even earlier, records
saints, 1400s people refuse ingest food. Another common myth
anorexia sort thing see rich societies. spoiled


children much food decide going focus slim
are, look bathing suits, et cetera, not true. careful analysis medical
epidemiology shown find anorexia even cultures societies
food scarce. So, really speaks biological mechanism. Now hard unveil
societies food scarce, lot people starving hungry,
individuals choose still avoid food seem sort
reward mechanism rewards them, makes feel better don't eat,
despite fact body severely depleted nutrients. So,
interesting points disruption biological mechanism. Now,
want make sure emphasizing not favor people, particular
young children, adolescents, teenagers bombarded unrealistic imagery
bodies. idea cause of, amplifying anorexia, data just
don't seem support that, anorexia classic sense, requires
endocrine, meaning hormonal disruption, menstrual abnormalities, lack sperm
production, low testosterone males, order meet classification anorexia.
mentioned earlier, now nuanced new classifications anorexia
even individuals still menstruate maintain sperm production
anorexia, can still considered clinically diagnosable disorder. Now, typically
anorexia starts adolescence, right around puberty. take look puberty is.
Puberty broad level significant dramatic developmental step.
Anyone goes lifespan. body changes, brain changes,
perceptions, change, one's self perception, changes. changes
driven changes circuitry within hypothalamus. So, neurons
controlling production so-called sex steroid hormones, things like testosterone,
estrogen, related hormones, prolactin, et cetera. changing
rapid rates. Anorexia tends show around time subset individuals

told go bed sent room. Now child can talk back say,
don't want to, refuse to. happens lot various households, sure
familiar with. Adolescence puberty also girls start menstruating
typically, boys develop deeper voice, start producing sperm, et cetera. So,
lot bodily changes also drive perceptual changes perceptual changes


drive bodily changes. dramatic shift young girl boy doesn't

answers not intuitive all. least surprising.
remiss didn't start obvious, is, chemical defect?
Meaning disruption one major chemical systems brain
makes anorexics anorexic therefore, can replace chemical? can
reduce chemical essentially eliminate anorexia? answer not really
sort maybe no, why, lot different chemicals brain body,
category chemicals particularly important listened
podcast before, even haven't going come
again, category chemicals brain body called

serotonin. Serotonin neuromodulator tends increase activity certain
neural circuits, including within hypothalamus, also within body trigger
sense satiety, enough, enough food, enough warmth, enough social
connection, enough motivated goal drive type thing behavior
one want of, serotonin tends make circuits quiet down. Now,
many categories drugs emphasize serotonergic circuitry, meaning
cause release of, efficiency serotonin brain body. Things like
Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, things variety. drugs used degree
success. Although not much treat things like anorexia nervosa. make


sense, drugs increase serotonin, general effect increase
serotonin, will lower anxiety. sounds like great thing. lot anorexics
really anxious around food. talk why, lowering anxiety might think
lead ingestion food, not often happens, increasing serotonin,
way drug regimen will tend make one less hungry,
heightened levels serotonin blood brain, isn't desire go seek
things will raise serotonin own. Now, anorexics well
benefit serotonergic drugs, drugs increase activity
circuits leads satiety. think major goal treating

reward based decision-making, drive pursue particular food drive
perform particular task, lot throughout day,
controlled brain area called ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Let simplify
little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related
behaviors. So, instance, want get particular grade exam, want
learn something, want complete workout. want go grocery store
pick stuff head home. going think duration. long
have, okay, 45 minutes get store? long take get
store path? way going drive there? way going navigate
grocery store, outcome, able get get items need get


home time, okay? DPO, duration path outcome. conscious process.
tend take account different criteria related preventing
accomplishing want helping assisting you. So,
course, get checkout line grocery store, going select

reward-based, use DPO type processes short term pick groceries
pick line grocery store decide trajectory take home.
use navigating long extended processes life, trying get degree raise

outcome, entire process relies fore brain. prefrontal cortex,
prefrontal cortex allows take information memory, combine
information happening present context, direct
behavior, speech, et cetera, toward particular outcomes. sounds like
mouthful, is, metabolically demanding, decision-making metabolically
demanding. takes effort, okay? Reflexes hand, don't involve prefrontal

walk, don't think right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot.
just it. doesn't rely prefrontal cortex. subconscious sometimes
called, basically don't use parts brain involved

examined brain activity anorexics selecting different foods.
mentioned earlier, hyper acuity awareness foods contain

01:24:06 Habit-Reward Circuits Flipped Anorexics: Reward Deprivation

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit
depth. part set circuits involved called go no-go
tasks. don't want go lot detail right now, take us
far rabbit hole neurocircuitry. basically terms behaviors,
DPO type behaviors. So, decision-making, reward based behaviors.

another aspect behavior, select behaviors perform.
select behaviors suppress. anorexic brain seems reward

habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort

ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based

Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think

includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high

many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails

get equal number emails people saying worked self

not passing judgment compounds people sort

clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating

pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human

distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just

Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can

anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need
eat. doesn't seem work. just don't see way
see them. offer point consideration, know someone

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar
prefrontal cortex. probably know prefrontal cortex ever
wanted to, just episode, prefrontal cortex involved analysis duration

think. Okay, this, that, that, this, can imagine obsessive

circuit going essentially underactive conditions
think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing
cupboards ordering food. feeling horrible
themselves. tend cycles binge purge followed
feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young
adult. So, really polar opposite see anorexia. So, lack
impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper
limbic hypothalamic circuitry, things sort. Anytime feel like want

okay? explode burst say wrong thing, say thing
shouldn't say thing shouldn't do, lack prefrontal control.
indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called
adrenergic, norepinephrine levels brain allow top-down control.
also used treat ADHD attention deficit disorder. tend

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain

food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just

can start additional interventions way non invasive treatments, things like
drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral

either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

00:55:30 Homeostasis & Reward Systems/Decisions

Dr. Halpern colleagues order try treat things like binge
eating disorder? Well, can frame behavior, good decision making bad
decision-making. pretty simple box diagram model. realized many
listening this, not watching this. no diagram look at. just explain
can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,
one box, okay? eat that. shouldn't eat that. wait dinner.
shouldn't wait dinner. actually another box, okay?
Now true behaviors, say something want say something,
don't, shouldn't say something, anyway. knowledge
kind looping head. homework. go run. shouldn't
right now. shouldn't social media, kinds shoulds
shouldn'ts circulating head. one box. actually
do. behavior, whether not suppress behavior, turn off phone
go read book go sleep whether not stay night, stay
another hour, even five minutes. two boxes two intervening
forces. intervening forces critically important. intervening forces
homeostatic processes, called processes, thing, homeostatic processes,
regulate balance different systems body, hot cold, awake

chill. So, homeostatic processes reward systems. now move

Now, don't want abstract here. saying person starves

earlier, anorexia things almost certainly were, anorexia

saints, 1400s people refuse ingest food. Another common myth
anorexia sort thing see rich societies. spoiled


children much food decide going focus slim

despite fact body severely depleted nutrients. So,
interesting points disruption biological mechanism. Now,
want make sure emphasizing not favor people, particular

mentioned earlier, now nuanced new classifications anorexia
even individuals still menstruate maintain sperm production
anorexia, can still considered clinically diagnosable disorder. Now, typically
anorexia starts adolescence, right around puberty. take look puberty is.
Puberty broad level significant dramatic developmental step.
Anyone goes lifespan. body changes, brain changes,

01:09:44 Chemical Imbalances, Serotonergic Treatments

answers not intuitive all. least surprising.
remiss didn't start obvious, is, chemical defect?
Meaning disruption one major chemical systems brain
makes anorexics anorexic therefore, can replace chemical? can
reduce chemical essentially eliminate anorexia? answer not really
sort maybe no, why, lot different chemicals brain body,
category chemicals particularly important listened
podcast before, even haven't going come
again, category chemicals brain body called
neuromodulators, neuromodulators different neuro-transmitters sense
neuromodulators modulator change activity brain areas neural circuits,

neural circuits, including within hypothalamus, also within body trigger
sense satiety, enough, enough food, enough warmth, enough social
connection, enough motivated goal drive type thing behavior
one want of, serotonin tends make circuits quiet down. Now,
many categories drugs emphasize serotonergic circuitry, meaning
cause release of, efficiency serotonin brain body. Things like
Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, things variety. drugs used degree
success. Although not much treat things like anorexia nervosa. make


sense, drugs increase serotonin, general effect increase
serotonin, will lower anxiety. sounds like great thing. lot anorexics
really anxious around food. talk why, lowering anxiety might think
lead ingestion food, not often happens, increasing serotonin,
way drug regimen will tend make one less hungry,
heightened levels serotonin blood brain, isn't desire go seek
things will raise serotonin own. Now, anorexics well
benefit serotonergic drugs, drugs increase activity
circuits leads satiety. think major goal treating

studying anorexia anorexia, essentially studying
absence behavior. hard study absence behavior, opposed

pictures different foods, allowing anorexia patients arrange foods,
according preference select, food, nutrient content
caloric content. essentially asked anorexics evaluate food,
so, able identify something unique anorexics level
perception food. found anorexics, rather anxious

anorexics hyper acuity, hyper awareness fat content foods, almost

this. not looking avocado thinking, okay, X number
grams fat rather, looking apple saying, okay, no fat. start

young anorexics kind obsession food, caloric contents,
macronutrient ratios, meaning fat protein carbohydrate ratios. know caloric

01:18:28 Brain Areas Reward Based Decision Making vs. Habits

best point intervention. So, Dr. Steinglass colleagues did,
took anorexics course control groups put FMRI
scanner, brain scanners allow evaluate brain areas
active, particular tasks. one scanners,
actually, know, actually one things. biting
bite bar time scanners immobile. So,
looking things TV screen. Sometimes can press buttons select
choices forth, can't really eat within things. found
reward based decision-making, drive pursue particular food drive
perform particular task, lot throughout day,
controlled brain area called ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Let simplify
little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related
behaviors. So, instance, want get particular grade exam, want
learn something, want complete workout. want go grocery store
pick stuff head home. going think duration. long
have, okay, 45 minutes get store? long take get
store path? way going drive there? way going navigate
grocery store, outcome, able get get items need get


home time, okay? DPO, duration path outcome. conscious process.
tend take account different criteria related preventing
accomplishing want helping assisting you. So,
course, get checkout line grocery store, going select
shortest line instance. So, DPO stuff. requires decision-making
reward-based, use DPO type processes short term pick groceries
pick line grocery store decide trajectory take home.
use navigating long extended processes life, trying get degree raise
children get particularly challenging year, et cetera. So, duration path
outcome, entire process relies fore brain. prefrontal cortex,
prefrontal cortex allows take information memory, combine

mouthful, is, metabolically demanding, decision-making metabolically

01:24:06 Habit-Reward Circuits Flipped Anorexics: Reward Deprivation

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit
depth. part set circuits involved called go no-go
tasks. don't want go lot detail right now, take us
far rabbit hole neurocircuitry. basically terms behaviors,
DPO type behaviors. So, decision-making, reward based behaviors.
habits learn acquire. just start reflexively, things like
walking, things like yawning tired, things like taking particular route
parking lot, right? learned first time go given parking lot walk


building. that, tend follow exact trajectory becomes
automatized. just like, just without thinking. Well, go no-go circuitry
another aspect behavior, select behaviors perform.
select behaviors suppress. anorexic brain seems reward
suppression one set behaviors, ingestion high calorie foods, reward focus,
even hyper-focus consumption low fat, low calorie foods. So, homeostatic

01:28:30 Break Habit?

going work intervening neural circuitry. related habit

rewire brain circuitry literally causing reflex? case causing
reflex killing individual, least leading bad health outcomes.
way cognitive mechanism teach individual,
leading habit? little bit similar way somebody


suffers addiction starts put different constraint type behaviors, constraint type
behaviors, sorts things like alcoholic will call hotel ahead time
say, listen, want mini bar taken room. don't want television

perceive internal state, can start learn, associate interactions
different types food, sorts cues occurring within body,
quickening heart rate, hyper acuity focus talked earlier.
start able notice things happening, can start
intervene. So, talk things lead habit,
turn exact points entry changing eliminating rewiring habits,
healthy behaviors. highlight isn't just rewiring
habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal
anorexic. might familiar this. kind uncomfortable around.
Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,
around. notice push food around plate lot. become
masterful actually trying keep people's awareness away doing,
hone low fat, low calorie foods. can't seem set shift.
can't just relax enjoy meal, meal essentially like
Waldo find face coffee tasked. constantly
monitoring much people observing trying navigate this.
otherwise really pleasant circumstance people trying navigate
remember them, reward avoidance certain things
acquiring foods brain rewards for,

01:33:23 Family Based Models, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

foods preselected now habit.
amazing. frankly also important findings teach anorexics,
happening them, this, able intervene. Now
need support, right? another form therapy seems work well anorexics
ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based
models starting surface lot now various therapy settings, therapy based
models short basically entire family made aware individual's
challenges particular eating disorder disorder. understanding
biology psychology around it, stopped condemning individual.
start support individual queuing towards habits
observe. give autonomy. realize none changes
overnight, taught things like neuroplasticity ability change
one's brain response experience. whole internal support network.


Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia
quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported
therapeutic environment can help people rewire brain, can get relief
major depression various forms trauma. now eating disorders also
explored context MDMA siliciden clinical trials. want
emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails
compounds. People telling amazing experiences
relief various things, not just eating disorders, depression, et cetera. However,
get equal number emails people saying worked self
appointed guide. outside clinical trials referring to,


now experiencing chronic visual, snow. getting genuine visual field deficits.
havering ticks never before, chronic insomnia. So,
not passing judgment compounds people sort
thing. just want see clinical data. believe wait
clinical trials done people start approaching stuff.
serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff
done regularly too. gotten reports back people so-
called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human
knowledge knowledge can allow make better decisions. say again,
beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might

common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue

many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar

impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper

indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see

bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called

particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies

invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin

individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral

So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things

00:55:30 Homeostasis & Reward Systems/Decisions

Dr. Halpern colleagues order try treat things like binge
eating disorder? Well, can frame behavior, good decision making bad
decision-making. pretty simple box diagram model. realized many
listening this, not watching this. no diagram look at. just explain
can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,
one box, okay? eat that. shouldn't eat that. wait dinner.
shouldn't wait dinner. actually another box, okay?
Now true behaviors, say something want say something,
don't, shouldn't say something, anyway. knowledge
kind looping head. homework. go run. shouldn't
right now. shouldn't social media, kinds shoulds
shouldn'ts circulating head. one box. actually
do. behavior, whether not suppress behavior, turn off phone
go read book go sleep whether not stay night, stay
another hour, even five minutes. two boxes two intervening
forces. intervening forces critically important. intervening forces
homeostatic processes, called processes, thing, homeostatic processes,
regulate balance different systems body, hot cold, awake
asleep, dopamine desire pursue things, serotonin desire just relax
chill. So, homeostatic processes reward systems. now move
discussion anorexia, bulimia specifically, see anorexia

disruption homeostatic reward processes, decision-making
completely disrupted. many cases not available anorexic bulimic.
Now, don't want abstract here. saying person starves

homeostatic processes reward processes associated food,

one effective treatments anorexia. So, now talk anorexia,
failure consume enough energy, individuals risk death, not

earlier, anorexia things almost certainly were, anorexia

saints, 1400s people refuse ingest food. Another common myth
anorexia sort thing see rich societies. spoiled


children much food decide going focus slim

societies food scarce, lot people starving hungry,
individuals choose still avoid food seem sort
reward mechanism rewards them, makes feel better don't eat,
despite fact body severely depleted nutrients. So,
interesting points disruption biological mechanism. Now,
want make sure emphasizing not favor people, particular
young children, adolescents, teenagers bombarded unrealistic imagery

don't seem support that, anorexia classic sense, requires
endocrine, meaning hormonal disruption, menstrual abnormalities, lack sperm

mentioned earlier, now nuanced new classifications anorexia
even individuals still menstruate maintain sperm production
anorexia, can still considered clinically diagnosable disorder. Now, typically
anorexia starts adolescence, right around puberty. take look puberty is.
Puberty broad level significant dramatic developmental step.
Anyone goes lifespan. body changes, brain changes,

masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel

want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within

involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive

Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing

sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think

includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical

pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within

distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar

think. Okay, this, that, that, this, can imagine obsessive

think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing
cupboards ordering food. feeling horrible

feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young

impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper

shouldn't say thing shouldn't do, lack prefrontal control.
indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called
adrenergic, norepinephrine levels brain allow top-down control.
also used treat ADHD attention deficit disorder. tend

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain

invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy

world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty

something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel

this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area

Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous

can conceptualize mind. knowledge do,

Meaning disruption one major chemical systems brain

reduce chemical essentially eliminate anorexia? answer not really
sort maybe no, why, lot different chemicals brain body,
category chemicals particularly important listened

many categories drugs emphasize serotonergic circuitry, meaning
cause release of, efficiency serotonin brain body. Things like
Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, things variety. drugs used degree
success. Although not much treat things like anorexia nervosa. make


sense, drugs increase serotonin, general effect increase
serotonin, will lower anxiety. sounds like great thing. lot anorexics
really anxious around food. talk why, lowering anxiety might think
lead ingestion food, not often happens, increasing serotonin,
way drug regimen will tend make one less hungry,
heightened levels serotonin blood brain, isn't desire go seek
things will raise serotonin own. Now, anorexics well
benefit serotonergic drugs, drugs increase activity
circuits leads satiety. think major goal treating

01:18:28 Brain Areas Reward Based Decision Making vs. Habits

best point intervention. So, Dr. Steinglass colleagues did,

scanner, brain scanners allow evaluate brain areas
active, particular tasks. one scanners,
actually, know, actually one things. biting

looking things TV screen. Sometimes can press buttons select

reward based decision-making, drive pursue particular food drive
perform particular task, lot throughout day,
controlled brain area called ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Let simplify
little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related
behaviors. So, instance, want get particular grade exam, want
learn something, want complete workout. want go grocery store
pick stuff head home. going think duration. long
have, okay, 45 minutes get store? long take get
store path? way going drive there? way going navigate
grocery store, outcome, able get get items need get


home time, okay? DPO, duration path outcome. conscious process.
tend take account different criteria related preventing
accomplishing want helping assisting you. So,
course, get checkout line grocery store, going select

reward-based, use DPO type processes short term pick groceries
pick line grocery store decide trajectory take home.
use navigating long extended processes life, trying get degree raise

01:24:06 Habit-Reward Circuits Flipped Anorexics: Reward Deprivation

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit
depth. part set circuits involved called go no-go
tasks. don't want go lot detail right now, take us
far rabbit hole neurocircuitry. basically terms behaviors,
DPO type behaviors. So, decision-making, reward based behaviors.
habits learn acquire. just start reflexively, things like
walking, things like yawning tired, things like taking particular route
parking lot, right? learned first time go given parking lot walk


building. that, tend follow exact trajectory becomes
automatized. just like, just without thinking. Well, go no-go circuitry
another aspect behavior, select behaviors perform.
select behaviors suppress. anorexic brain seems reward
suppression one set behaviors, ingestion high calorie foods, reward focus,
even hyper-focus consumption low fat, low calorie foods. So, homeostatic

suffers addiction starts put different constraint type behaviors, constraint type

turn exact points entry changing eliminating rewiring habits,
healthy behaviors. highlight isn't just rewiring
habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal
anorexic. might familiar this. kind uncomfortable around.
Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,
around. notice push food around plate lot. become
masterful actually trying keep people's awareness away doing,
hone low fat, low calorie foods. can't seem set shift.
can't just relax enjoy meal, meal essentially like
Waldo find face coffee tasked. constantly
monitoring much people observing trying navigate this.
otherwise really pleasant circumstance people trying navigate
remember them, reward avoidance certain things

01:33:23 Family Based Models, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

foods preselected now habit.
amazing. frankly also important findings teach anorexics,
happening them, this, able intervene. Now
need support, right? another form therapy seems work well anorexics
ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based
models starting surface lot now various therapy settings, therapy based
models short basically entire family made aware individual's
challenges particular eating disorder disorder. understanding
biology psychology around it, stopped condemning individual.
start support individual queuing towards habits
observe. give autonomy. realize none changes
overnight, taught things like neuroplasticity ability change
one's brain response experience. whole internal support network.


Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia
quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported
therapeutic environment can help people rewire brain, can get relief
major depression various forms trauma. now eating disorders also
explored context MDMA siliciden clinical trials. want
emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails
compounds. People telling amazing experiences
relief various things, not just eating disorders, depression, et cetera. However,
get equal number emails people saying worked self
appointed guide. outside clinical trials referring to,


now experiencing chronic visual, snow. getting genuine visual field deficits.
havering ticks never before, chronic insomnia. So,
not passing judgment compounds people sort
thing. just want see clinical data. believe wait
clinical trials done people start approaching stuff.
serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff
done regularly too. gotten reports back people so-
called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human
knowledge knowledge can allow make better decisions. say again,
beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar

think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing
cupboards ordering food. feeling horrible

feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young

impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper

indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire

area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral

singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily

So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things

just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information

Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous

Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing

purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,

masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel

approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit

turn exact points entry changing eliminating rewiring habits,
healthy behaviors. highlight isn't just rewiring
habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal

Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,

amazing. frankly also important findings teach anorexics,
happening them, this, able intervene. Now
need support, right? another form therapy seems work well anorexics
ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based
models starting surface lot now various therapy settings, therapy based
models short basically entire family made aware individual's
challenges particular eating disorder disorder. understanding
biology psychology around it, stopped condemning individual.
start support individual queuing towards habits
observe. give autonomy. realize none changes
overnight, taught things like neuroplasticity ability change
one's brain response experience. whole internal support network.


Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia
quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported
therapeutic environment can help people rewire brain, can get relief
major depression various forms trauma. now eating disorders also
explored context MDMA siliciden clinical trials. want
emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails
compounds. People telling amazing experiences
relief various things, not just eating disorders, depression, et cetera. However,
get equal number emails people saying worked self

now experiencing chronic visual, snow. getting genuine visual field deficits.
havering ticks never before, chronic insomnia. So,
not passing judgment compounds people sort

clinical trials done people start approaching stuff.
serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff

called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human

beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode

anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe

conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic
suffering sort disorder. just means human
cares appear world. not judge case
anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self
image much don't actually see accurately, visual

beautiful studies done colleague, Jeremy Bailenson's lab
Stanford, department communications, actually collaborated Dr.
Halpern mentioned earlier. really interesting studies


give us window perceptual defect anorexics have. actually done one
experiments. fortunate not anorexic, done work
VR lab there. get get adjust avatar

talked family based model, Connie behavioral treatments. Yes,
drug treatments well. habit intervention model one starts shift
things, appear perception self seems follow
perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning
don't change easily. Whereas appears circuitry related habit
formation, decision-making reward, circuitry, stuff can rewired.
anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need
eat. doesn't seem work. just don't see way
see them. offer point consideration, know someone
anorexic, look anorexic think, still critical
small, even nonexistent amount body fat triceps something?
that? Well, literally brain, relates perceptions, visual perceptions
particular, completely off.

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar
prefrontal cortex. probably know prefrontal cortex ever
wanted to, just episode, prefrontal cortex involved analysis duration

think. Okay, this, that, that, this, can imagine obsessive
compulsive anorexic, circuits overactive. bulimic
circuit going essentially underactive conditions
think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing
cupboards ordering food. feeling horrible
themselves. tend cycles binge purge followed
feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young
adult. So, really polar opposite see anorexia. So, lack
impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper
limbic hypothalamic circuitry, things sort. Anytime feel like want
say something really offensive don't, top-down control.
prefrontal cortex. Anytime someone says something like grow teeth.
'Cause know shouldn't say anything, gritting teeth top-dow control,
okay? explode burst say wrong thing, say thing
shouldn't say thing shouldn't do, lack prefrontal control.
indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called
adrenergic, norepinephrine levels brain allow top-down control.
also used treat ADHD attention deficit disorder. tend

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just

either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find

fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related

01:24:06 Habit-Reward Circuits Flipped Anorexics: Reward Deprivation

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit
depth. part set circuits involved called go no-go
tasks. don't want go lot detail right now, take us
far rabbit hole neurocircuitry. basically terms behaviors,
DPO type behaviors. So, decision-making, reward based behaviors.
habits learn acquire. just start reflexively, things like

parking lot, right? learned first time go given parking lot walk


building. that, tend follow exact trajectory becomes
automatized. just like, just without thinking. Well, go no-go circuitry
another aspect behavior, select behaviors perform.
select behaviors suppress. anorexic brain seems reward
suppression one set behaviors, ingestion high calorie foods, reward focus,
even hyper-focus consumption low fat, low calorie foods. So, homeostatic

turn exact points entry changing eliminating rewiring habits,
healthy behaviors. highlight isn't just rewiring
habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal
anorexic. might familiar this. kind uncomfortable around.
Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,
around. notice push food around plate lot. become
masterful actually trying keep people's awareness away doing,
hone low fat, low calorie foods. can't seem set shift.
can't just relax enjoy meal, meal essentially like
Waldo find face coffee tasked. constantly
monitoring much people observing trying navigate this.
otherwise really pleasant circumstance people trying navigate
remember them, reward avoidance certain things

01:33:23 Family Based Models, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

foods preselected now habit.
amazing. frankly also important findings teach anorexics,
happening them, this, able intervene. Now
need support, right? another form therapy seems work well anorexics
ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based
models starting surface lot now various therapy settings, therapy based
models short basically entire family made aware individual's
challenges particular eating disorder disorder. understanding
biology psychology around it, stopped condemning individual.
start support individual queuing towards habits
observe. give autonomy. realize none changes
overnight, taught things like neuroplasticity ability change
one's brain response experience. whole internal support network.


Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia
quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported
therapeutic environment can help people rewire brain, can get relief
major depression various forms trauma. now eating disorders also

emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails
compounds. People telling amazing experiences
relief various things, not just eating disorders, depression, et cetera. However,
get equal number emails people saying worked self

now experiencing chronic visual, snow. getting genuine visual field deficits.
havering ticks never before, chronic insomnia. So,
not passing judgment compounds people sort

clinical trials done people start approaching stuff.
serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff

called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human

beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining
weight, don't constantly treadmill, no pun intended
balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-
exercise induced thermogenesis people tend thin, tend bounce
around lot. kind fidgety burns 1000 calories day, anywhere
800 2000 calories day. Now can beneficial folks
overweight healthy mindset food, trying lose weight.
turns by, literally fidgeting bouncing around, like,
this. looks ridiculous. actually burn lot body fat calories. way provide


caloric deficit, burn body fat body fat not just passive

neat. described several decades now. actually pretty
terrific way burn off calories. So, anorexic, actually want
encourage not constantly trying burn off calories. can
challenging. So, shifting toward activities like weight bearing activities resistance
training promote

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode
depression, talked powerful aspect major depression,
anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe
statements feelings behaviors start reflect lie. not
conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic
suffering sort disorder. just means human
cares appear world. not judge case
anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self

perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning

anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed

doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just
pump brakes little bit, no break, right? So, start going faster

interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

answers not intuitive all. least surprising.
remiss didn't start obvious, is, chemical defect?
Meaning disruption one major chemical systems brain
makes anorexics anorexic therefore, can replace chemical? can
reduce chemical essentially eliminate anorexia? answer not really
sort maybe no, why, lot different chemicals brain body,
category chemicals particularly important listened
podcast before, even haven't going come
again, category chemicals brain body called

serotonin. Serotonin neuromodulator tends increase activity certain
neural circuits, including within hypothalamus, also within body trigger

many categories drugs emphasize serotonergic circuitry, meaning
cause release of, efficiency serotonin brain body. Things like
Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, things variety. drugs used degree
success. Although not much treat things like anorexia nervosa. make


sense, drugs increase serotonin, general effect increase
serotonin, will lower anxiety. sounds like great thing. lot anorexics
really anxious around food. talk why, lowering anxiety might think
lead ingestion food, not often happens, increasing serotonin,
way drug regimen will tend make one less hungry,
heightened levels serotonin blood brain, isn't desire go seek
things will raise serotonin own. Now, anorexics well
benefit serotonergic drugs, drugs increase activity

studying anorexia anorexia, essentially studying
absence behavior. hard study absence behavior, opposed
behavior. So, experiments anorexics, giving gallery
pictures different foods, allowing anorexia patients arrange foods,
according preference select, food, nutrient content
caloric content. essentially asked anorexics evaluate food,
so, able identify something unique anorexics level
perception food. found anorexics, rather anxious

this. not looking avocado thinking, okay, X number

young anorexics kind obsession food, caloric contents,
macronutrient ratios, meaning fat protein carbohydrate ratios. know caloric
numbers, sort pass information memory system brain
allows interactions food, reflexive way actively
avoiding high-fat content, foods, calorie rich foods, defaulting towards low

01:18:28 Brain Areas Reward Based Decision Making vs. Habits

best point intervention. So, Dr. Steinglass colleagues did,
took anorexics course control groups put FMRI
scanner, brain scanners allow evaluate brain areas
active, particular tasks. one scanners,
actually, know, actually one things. biting
bite bar time scanners immobile. So,
looking things TV screen. Sometimes can press buttons select
choices forth, can't really eat within things. found
reward based decision-making, drive pursue particular food drive
perform particular task, lot throughout day,
controlled brain area called ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Let simplify
little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related
behaviors. So, instance, want get particular grade exam, want
learn something, want complete workout. want go grocery store
pick stuff head home. going think duration. long
have, okay, 45 minutes get store? long take get
store path? way going drive there? way going navigate
grocery store, outcome, able get get items need get


home time, okay? DPO, duration path outcome. conscious process.
tend take account different criteria related preventing
accomplishing want helping assisting you. So,
course, get checkout line grocery store, going select
shortest line instance. So, DPO stuff. requires decision-making
reward-based, use DPO type processes short term pick groceries
pick line grocery store decide trajectory take home.
use navigating long extended processes life, trying get degree raise
children get particularly challenging year, et cetera. So, duration path
outcome, entire process relies fore brain. prefrontal cortex,
prefrontal cortex allows take information memory, combine
information happening present context, direct
behavior, speech, et cetera, toward particular outcomes. sounds like
mouthful, is, metabolically demanding, decision-making metabolically
demanding. takes effort, okay? Reflexes hand, don't involve prefrontal
cortex way, habits reflexes. Like know walk, get
walk, don't think right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot.
just it. doesn't rely prefrontal cortex. subconscious sometimes
called, basically don't use parts brain involved
duration path outcome type analysis. Okay, so, particular study,
examined brain activity anorexics selecting different foods.
mentioned earlier, hyper acuity awareness foods contain
less calories foods fat content particular foods is,
particular, et cetera, scanner. look

interesting, found dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex not surprisingly

However, areas brain active decision-making

striatum big area brain. involved lot different things. includes areas


like caudate putamen. just want mention, throw
names, not need remember names different structures.
just there, interested level detail, basically brain area

01:24:06 Habit-Reward Circuits Flipped Anorexics: Reward Deprivation

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit
depth. part set circuits involved called go no-go
tasks. don't want go lot detail right now, take us
far rabbit hole neurocircuitry. basically terms behaviors,
DPO type behaviors. So, decision-making, reward based behaviors.
habits learn acquire. just start reflexively, things like
walking, things like yawning tired, things like taking particular route
parking lot, right? learned first time go given parking lot walk


building. that, tend follow exact trajectory becomes
automatized. just like, just without thinking. Well, go no-go circuitry
another aspect behavior, select behaviors perform.
select behaviors suppress. anorexic brain seems reward
suppression one set behaviors, ingestion high calorie foods, reward focus,
even hyper-focus consumption low fat, low calorie foods. So, homeostatic
process learn like high school onward, that, oh, everything
body designed keep everything balance. stay awake certain amount

Clearly, overriding homeostatic processes, signals say

01:28:30 Break Habit?

going work intervening neural circuitry. related habit

rewire brain circuitry literally causing reflex? case causing
reflex killing individual, least leading bad health outcomes.
way cognitive mechanism teach individual,
leading habit? little bit similar way somebody


suffers addiction starts put different constraint type behaviors, constraint type
behaviors, sorts things like alcoholic will call hotel ahead time
say, listen, want mini bar taken room. don't want television
room, et cetera, constraint type behaviors. really ways keeping oneself
temptation. habits, work subconscious level.
seems work best combination teaching individual internal

perceive internal state, can start learn, associate interactions
different types food, sorts cues occurring within body,
quickening heart rate, hyper acuity focus talked earlier.
start able notice things happening, can start
intervene. So, talk things lead habit,
turn exact points entry changing eliminating rewiring habits,
healthy behaviors. highlight isn't just rewiring
habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal
anorexic. might familiar this. kind uncomfortable around.
Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,
around. notice push food around plate lot. become
masterful actually trying keep people's awareness away doing,
hone low fat, low calorie foods. can't seem set shift.
can't just relax enjoy meal, meal essentially like
Waldo find face coffee tasked. constantly
monitoring much people observing trying navigate this.
otherwise really pleasant circumstance people trying navigate
remember them, reward avoidance certain things
acquiring foods brain rewards for,

01:33:23 Family Based Models, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

foods preselected now habit.
amazing. frankly also important findings teach anorexics,
happening them, this, able intervene. Now
need support, right? another form therapy seems work well anorexics
ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based
models starting surface lot now various therapy settings, therapy based
models short basically entire family made aware individual's
challenges particular eating disorder disorder. understanding
biology psychology around it, stopped condemning individual.
start support individual queuing towards habits
observe. give autonomy. realize none changes
overnight, taught things like neuroplasticity ability change
one's brain response experience. whole internal support network.


Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia
quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported
therapeutic environment can help people rewire brain, can get relief
major depression various forms trauma. now eating disorders also

many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails

serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff
done regularly too. gotten reports back people so-
called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human
knowledge knowledge can allow make better decisions. say again,
beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining
weight, don't constantly treadmill, no pun intended
balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-
exercise induced thermogenesis people tend thin, tend bounce
around lot. kind fidgety burns 1000 calories day, anywhere
800 2000 calories day. Now can beneficial folks
overweight healthy mindset food, trying lose weight.
turns by, literally fidgeting bouncing around, like,
this. looks ridiculous. actually burn lot body fat calories. way provide


caloric deficit, burn body fat body fat not just passive

neat. described several decades now. actually pretty
terrific way burn off calories. So, anorexic, actually want
encourage not constantly trying burn off calories. can
challenging. So, shifting toward activities like weight bearing activities resistance
training promote

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode
depression, talked powerful aspect major depression,
anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe
statements feelings behaviors start reflect lie. not
conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic
suffering sort disorder. just means human
cares appear world. not judge case
anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self
image much don't actually see accurately, visual
perceptions off. reason know this, really important
beautiful studies done colleague, Jeremy Bailenson's lab
Stanford, department communications, actually collaborated Dr.
Halpern mentioned earlier. really interesting studies


give us window perceptual defect anorexics have. actually done one
experiments. fortunate not anorexic, done work
VR lab there. get get adjust avatar
point think it's, accurate possibly be, anorexics, really
distort avatar. words, create serious mismatch
perception reality. So, indeed seem case now
relieving, say encouraging therapies
talked family based model, Connie behavioral treatments. Yes,
drug treatments well. habit intervention model one starts shift
things, appear perception self seems follow
perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning
don't change easily. Whereas appears circuitry related habit
formation, decision-making reward, circuitry, stuff can rewired.
anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need
eat. doesn't seem work. just don't see way
see them. offer point consideration, know someone
anorexic, look anorexic think, still critical
small, even nonexistent amount body fat triceps something?
that? Well, literally brain, relates perceptions, visual perceptions
particular, completely off.

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar
prefrontal cortex. probably know prefrontal cortex ever
wanted to, just episode, prefrontal cortex involved analysis duration

think. Okay, this, that, that, this, can imagine obsessive

circuit going essentially underactive conditions
think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing
cupboards ordering food. feeling horrible
themselves. tend cycles binge purge followed
feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young
adult. So, really polar opposite see anorexia. So, lack
impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper
limbic hypothalamic circuitry, things sort. Anytime feel like want

prefrontal cortex. Anytime someone says something like grow teeth.
'Cause know shouldn't say anything, gritting teeth top-dow control,
okay? explode burst say wrong thing, say thing
shouldn't say thing shouldn't do, lack prefrontal control.
indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called
adrenergic, norepinephrine levels brain allow top-down control.
also used treat ADHD attention deficit disorder. tend

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just

faster faster. choice use accelerator just coach it.
essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern
others, think really exciting. even though highly invasive, think going

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things

world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy

complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area

Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing

think us going circumstances rushing around trying

little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related

want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within

put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array

becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind

ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based

Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing

sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think

includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical

many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete

clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating

pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within

distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just

Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life

overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face

anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self

accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar

think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing

feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young

impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper

indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no

called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire

obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin

individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral

So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things

world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy

this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't

just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area

Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing

think us going circumstances rushing around trying

want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within

put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array

becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,

not passing judgment. just like see data. important

self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually

dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting

talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering

binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,

certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making

cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide

recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also

indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see

bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,

topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

describe done Dr. Joanna Steinglass colleagues Columbia University
New York. groups well. course, type work,
think really beautiful experiments beautiful
explorations potential treatments anorexics. seemed quite high
degree effectiveness applied correctly. First all, challenge
studying anorexia anorexia, essentially studying
absence behavior. hard study absence behavior, opposed

pictures different foods, allowing anorexia patients arrange foods,
according preference select, food, nutrient content
caloric content. essentially asked anorexics evaluate food,
so, able identify something unique anorexics level
perception food. found anorexics, rather anxious

01:18:28 Brain Areas Reward Based Decision Making vs. Habits

best point intervention. So, Dr. Steinglass colleagues did,
took anorexics course control groups put FMRI
scanner, brain scanners allow evaluate brain areas
active, particular tasks. one scanners,
actually, know, actually one things. biting
bite bar time scanners immobile. So,
looking things TV screen. Sometimes can press buttons select
choices forth, can't really eat within things. found
reward based decision-making, drive pursue particular food drive
perform particular task, lot throughout day,
controlled brain area called ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Let simplify
little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related
behaviors. So, instance, want get particular grade exam, want
learn something, want complete workout. want go grocery store
pick stuff head home. going think duration. long
have, okay, 45 minutes get store? long take get
store path? way going drive there? way going navigate
grocery store, outcome, able get get items need get


home time, okay? DPO, duration path outcome. conscious process.
tend take account different criteria related preventing
accomplishing want helping assisting you. So,
course, get checkout line grocery store, going select
shortest line instance. So, DPO stuff. requires decision-making
reward-based, use DPO type processes short term pick groceries
pick line grocery store decide trajectory take home.
use navigating long extended processes life, trying get degree raise
children get particularly challenging year, et cetera. So, duration path
outcome, entire process relies fore brain. prefrontal cortex,
prefrontal cortex allows take information memory, combine
information happening present context, direct
behavior, speech, et cetera, toward particular outcomes. sounds like
mouthful, is, metabolically demanding, decision-making metabolically
demanding. takes effort, okay? Reflexes hand, don't involve prefrontal
cortex way, habits reflexes. Like know walk, get
walk, don't think right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot.
just it. doesn't rely prefrontal cortex. subconscious sometimes
called, basically don't use parts brain involved
duration path outcome type analysis. Okay, so, particular study,
examined brain activity anorexics selecting different foods.
mentioned earlier, hyper acuity awareness foods contain
less calories foods fat content particular foods is,
particular, et cetera, scanner. look
sorts brain areas active task done. found really
interesting, found dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex not surprisingly

However, areas brain active decision-making

striatum big area brain. involved lot different things. includes areas


like caudate putamen. just want mention, throw

just there, interested level detail, basically brain area

01:24:06 Habit-Reward Circuits Flipped Anorexics: Reward Deprivation

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit
depth. part set circuits involved called go no-go
tasks. don't want go lot detail right now, take us
far rabbit hole neurocircuitry. basically terms behaviors,
DPO type behaviors. So, decision-making, reward based behaviors.
habits learn acquire. just start reflexively, things like
walking, things like yawning tired, things like taking particular route
parking lot, right? learned first time go given parking lot walk


building. that, tend follow exact trajectory becomes
automatized. just like, just without thinking. Well, go no-go circuitry
another aspect behavior, select behaviors perform.
select behaviors suppress. anorexic brain seems reward
suppression one set behaviors, ingestion high calorie foods, reward focus,
even hyper-focus consumption low fat, low calorie foods. So, homeostatic
process learn like high school onward, that, oh, everything
body designed keep everything balance. stay awake certain amount
time. want sleep, don't eat while. want eat maintain
weight, right? eat much. want eat less. systems

says place intervene habit. stuff already passed
learning, passed reward systems. clearly not
overrun homeostatic processes body. little body fat.
no leptin, whatever neurons brain respond leptin starved leptin, periods

Clearly, overriding homeostatic processes, signals say
eat, eat, eat. don't matter brain anorexic. brain anorexic
just performing habits rewarded it. So, come along
say, look, really eat whole pie whole pizza feel better.
aversive them. So, since appears habit, reflex perpetuating
anorexic phenotype. say, science, perpetuating anorexia
individual telling terrible stuff happening body won't
work, taking away images thin people online, et cetera. not
going work. going work.

01:28:30 Break Habit?

going work intervening neural circuitry. related habit
itself. turns ways that. So, break habit?
rewire brain circuitry literally causing reflex? case causing
reflex killing individual, least leading bad health outcomes.
way cognitive mechanism teach individual,
leading habit? little bit similar way somebody


suffers addiction starts put different constraint type behaviors, constraint type
behaviors, sorts things like alcoholic will call hotel ahead time
say, listen, want mini bar taken room. don't want television
room, et cetera, constraint type behaviors. really ways keeping oneself
temptation. habits, work subconscious level.
seems work best combination teaching individual internal
state register internal state. call interoception ability
perceive internal state, can start learn, associate interactions
different types food, sorts cues occurring within body,
quickening heart rate, hyper acuity focus talked earlier.
start able notice things happening, can start
intervene. So, talk things lead habit,
turn exact points entry changing eliminating rewiring habits,
healthy behaviors. highlight isn't just rewiring
habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal
anorexic. might familiar this. kind uncomfortable around.
Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,
around. notice push food around plate lot. become
masterful actually trying keep people's awareness away doing,
hone low fat, low calorie foods. can't seem set shift.
can't just relax enjoy meal, meal essentially like
Waldo find face coffee tasked. constantly
monitoring much people observing trying navigate this.
otherwise really pleasant circumstance people trying navigate
remember them, reward avoidance certain things
acquiring foods brain rewards for,

01:33:23 Family Based Models, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

foods preselected now habit.
amazing. frankly also important findings teach anorexics,
happening them, this, able intervene. Now
need support, right? another form therapy seems work well anorexics
ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based
models starting surface lot now various therapy settings, therapy based
models short basically entire family made aware individual's
challenges particular eating disorder disorder. understanding
biology psychology around it, stopped condemning individual.
start support individual queuing towards habits
observe. give autonomy. realize none changes
overnight, taught things like neuroplasticity ability change
one's brain response experience. whole internal support network.


Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia
quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported
therapeutic environment can help people rewire brain, can get relief
major depression various forms trauma. now eating disorders also
explored context MDMA siliciden clinical trials. want
emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails
compounds. People telling amazing experiences
relief various things, not just eating disorders, depression, et cetera. However,
get equal number emails people saying worked self
appointed guide. outside clinical trials referring to,


now experiencing chronic visual, snow. getting genuine visual field deficits.
havering ticks never before, chronic insomnia. So,
not passing judgment compounds people sort
thing. just want see clinical data. believe wait
clinical trials done people start approaching stuff.
serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff
done regularly too. gotten reports back people so-
called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human
knowledge knowledge can allow make better decisions. say again,
beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining
weight, don't constantly treadmill, no pun intended
balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-
exercise induced thermogenesis people tend thin, tend bounce
around lot. kind fidgety burns 1000 calories day, anywhere
800 2000 calories day. Now can beneficial folks
overweight healthy mindset food, trying lose weight.
turns by, literally fidgeting bouncing around, like,
this. looks ridiculous. actually burn lot body fat calories. way provide


caloric deficit, burn body fat body fat not just passive
tissue. actually receives input neurons release noradrenaline adrenaline.
neat. described several decades now. actually pretty
terrific way burn off calories. So, anorexic, actually want
encourage not constantly trying burn off calories. can
challenging. So, shifting toward activities like weight bearing activities resistance
training promote

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode
depression, talked powerful aspect major depression,
anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe
statements feelings behaviors start reflect lie. not
conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic
suffering sort disorder. just means human
cares appear world. not judge case
anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self
image much don't actually see accurately, visual
perceptions off. reason know this, really important
beautiful studies done colleague, Jeremy Bailenson's lab
Stanford, department communications, actually collaborated Dr.
Halpern mentioned earlier. really interesting studies


give us window perceptual defect anorexics have. actually done one
experiments. fortunate not anorexic, done work
VR lab there. get get adjust avatar
point think it's, accurate possibly be, anorexics, really
distort avatar. words, create serious mismatch
perception reality. So, indeed seem case now
relieving, say encouraging therapies
talked family based model, Connie behavioral treatments. Yes,
drug treatments well. habit intervention model one starts shift
things, appear perception self seems follow
perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning
don't change easily. Whereas appears circuitry related habit
formation, decision-making reward, circuitry, stuff can rewired.
anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need
eat. doesn't seem work. just don't see way
see them. offer point consideration, know someone
anorexic, look anorexic think, still critical
small, even nonexistent amount body fat triceps something?
that? Well, literally brain, relates perceptions, visual perceptions
particular, completely off.

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar
prefrontal cortex. probably know prefrontal cortex ever
wanted to, just episode, prefrontal cortex involved analysis duration
path outcome. Duration path outcome avoid impulsivity.
think. Okay, this, that, that, this, can imagine obsessive
compulsive anorexic, circuits overactive. bulimic
circuit going essentially underactive conditions
think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing
cupboards ordering food. feeling horrible
themselves. tend cycles binge purge followed
feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young
adult. So, really polar opposite see anorexia. So, lack
impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper
limbic hypothalamic circuitry, things sort. Anytime feel like want
say something really offensive don't, top-down control.
prefrontal cortex. Anytime someone says something like grow teeth.
'Cause know shouldn't say anything, gritting teeth top-dow control,
okay? explode burst say wrong thing, say thing

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area

Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.

leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used

habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry

just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information

Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous

question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not

right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window

little bit this, going simplify giving little detail,
Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related

01:24:06 Habit-Reward Circuits Flipped Anorexics: Reward Deprivation

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit
depth. part set circuits involved called go no-go
tasks. don't want go lot detail right now, take us
far rabbit hole neurocircuitry. basically terms behaviors,
DPO type behaviors. So, decision-making, reward based behaviors.
habits learn acquire. just start reflexively, things like
walking, things like yawning tired, things like taking particular route
parking lot, right? learned first time go given parking lot walk


building. that, tend follow exact trajectory becomes
automatized. just like, just without thinking. Well, go no-go circuitry
another aspect behavior, select behaviors perform.
select behaviors suppress. anorexic brain seems reward
suppression one set behaviors, ingestion high calorie foods, reward focus,
even hyper-focus consumption low fat, low calorie foods. So, homeostatic

turn exact points entry changing eliminating rewiring habits,
healthy behaviors. highlight isn't just rewiring
habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within
given environment. actually interesting probe test anorexia
involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal
anorexic. might familiar this. kind uncomfortable around.
Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,
around. notice push food around plate lot. become
masterful actually trying keep people's awareness away doing,
hone low fat, low calorie foods. can't seem set shift.
can't just relax enjoy meal, meal essentially like
Waldo find face coffee tasked. constantly
monitoring much people observing trying navigate this.
otherwise really pleasant circumstance people trying navigate
remember them, reward avoidance certain things

01:33:23 Family Based Models, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

foods preselected now habit.
amazing. frankly also important findings teach anorexics,
happening them, this, able intervene. Now
need support, right? another form therapy seems work well anorexics
ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based
models starting surface lot now various therapy settings, therapy based
models short basically entire family made aware individual's
challenges particular eating disorder disorder. understanding
biology psychology around it, stopped condemning individual.
start support individual queuing towards habits
observe. give autonomy. realize none changes
overnight, taught things like neuroplasticity ability change
one's brain response experience. whole internal support network.


Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia
quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported
therapeutic environment can help people rewire brain, can get relief
major depression various forms trauma. now eating disorders also
explored context MDMA siliciden clinical trials. want
emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails
compounds. People telling amazing experiences
relief various things, not just eating disorders, depression, et cetera. However,
get equal number emails people saying worked self
appointed guide. outside clinical trials referring to,


now experiencing chronic visual, snow. getting genuine visual field deficits.
havering ticks never before, chronic insomnia. So,
not passing judgment compounds people sort
thing. just want see clinical data. believe wait
clinical trials done people start approaching stuff.
serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff
done regularly too. gotten reports back people so-
called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human
knowledge knowledge can allow make better decisions. say again,
beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining
weight, don't constantly treadmill, no pun intended
balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-
exercise induced thermogenesis people tend thin, tend bounce
around lot. kind fidgety burns 1000 calories day, anywhere
800 2000 calories day. Now can beneficial folks
overweight healthy mindset food, trying lose weight.
turns by, literally fidgeting bouncing around, like,
this. looks ridiculous. actually burn lot body fat calories. way provide


caloric deficit, burn body fat body fat not just passive

neat. described several decades now. actually pretty
terrific way burn off calories. So, anorexic, actually want
encourage not constantly trying burn off calories. can
challenging. So, shifting toward activities like weight bearing activities resistance
training promote

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode
depression, talked powerful aspect major depression,
anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe
statements feelings behaviors start reflect lie. not
conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic
suffering sort disorder. just means human
cares appear world. not judge case
anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self
image much don't actually see accurately, visual
perceptions off. reason know this, really important
beautiful studies done colleague, Jeremy Bailenson's lab
Stanford, department communications, actually collaborated Dr.
Halpern mentioned earlier. really interesting studies


give us window perceptual defect anorexics have. actually done one
experiments. fortunate not anorexic, done work
VR lab there. get get adjust avatar

perception reality. So, indeed seem case now
relieving, say encouraging therapies
talked family based model, Connie behavioral treatments. Yes,
drug treatments well. habit intervention model one starts shift
things, appear perception self seems follow
perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning
don't change easily. Whereas appears circuitry related habit
formation, decision-making reward, circuitry, stuff can rewired.
anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need
eat. doesn't seem work. just don't see way
see them. offer point consideration, know someone
anorexic, look anorexic think, still critical
small, even nonexistent amount body fat triceps something?
that? Well, literally brain, relates perceptions, visual perceptions
particular, completely off.

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat

described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame

Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue

many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.

singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion

So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important

world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel

this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can

physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat

think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

Huberman Lab Podcast. believe mechanism, mechanism way get
true understanding can quick give overviews things,
need mechanism. So, reflexes neural processes
include called duration path outcome type processes, duration path,
outcome type process, can shorten DPO. DPO types goal related

always homeostatic reward systems influencing kind thing. Well,
brain anorexic, turns reward systems attached
execution habits way unhealthy body weight, least
purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,
low fat foods. So, really seem flip switch, anorexic brain
rewards internally. feel good avoid certain foods
approach others. So, not deprivation based model flagellating
masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel
good, presumably release different neuromodulator called dopamine,
approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit

want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within

involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal

Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,

amazing. frankly also important findings teach anorexics,
happening them, this, able intervene. Now
need support, right? another form therapy seems work well anorexics
ideally combined habit rewiring, family-based model. Family-based
models starting surface lot now various therapy settings, therapy based
models short basically entire family made aware individual's
challenges particular eating disorder disorder. understanding
biology psychology around it, stopped condemning individual.
start support individual queuing towards habits
observe. give autonomy. realize none changes
overnight, taught things like neuroplasticity ability change
one's brain response experience. whole internal support network.


Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia
quite high. 50% individuals will relapse point often triggered
stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported
therapeutic environment can help people rewire brain, can get relief
major depression various forms trauma. now eating disorders also
explored context MDMA siliciden clinical trials. want
emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails
compounds. People telling amazing experiences
relief various things, not just eating disorders, depression, et cetera. However,
get equal number emails people saying worked self
appointed guide. outside clinical trials referring to,


now experiencing chronic visual, snow. getting genuine visual field deficits.
havering ticks never before, chronic insomnia. So,
not passing judgment compounds people sort
thing. just want see clinical data. believe wait
clinical trials done people start approaching stuff.
serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff
done regularly too. gotten reports back people so-
called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human
knowledge knowledge can allow make better decisions. say again,
beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just

way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue

many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,

drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar

indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire

obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin

individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral

So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry

give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat

fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

purely neural circuit perspective, reward now given chemical reward
brain, given avoiding particular foods approaching low calorie,

masochistic actively avoiding food order punish themselves,
interesting lot psychological theories support idea. Rather,
transitions set habits, actually getting sense reward. feel

approaching foods low fat, low calorie content. whole brain circuitry
skewed toward avoiding particular things. actually rewarded that,
feel good. feel better eating healthy weight supporting
way. Now dorsolateral striatum structure think little bit

features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within

put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive
disorder per se. So, call weak central coherence. hyper acuity one


particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one

Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,

Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think

includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high

emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails

serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff

called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within

distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually

dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might

common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue

many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar

impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper

indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire

food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within

put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array

becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just

Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think
date looked really good especially individuals taught early
adolescence, positive outcomes time, relapse rate anorexia

stressful life circumstance. combination cognitive behavioral therapy
includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high

explored context MDMA siliciden clinical trials. want
emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails

get equal number emails people saying worked self

data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff

clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within

switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human

distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually

dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar

think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing

feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young

impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper

indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called
adrenergic, norepinephrine levels brain allow top-down control.
also used treat ADHD attention deficit disorder. tend

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire

area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just

essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern
others, think really exciting. even though highly invasive, think going

also identification sorts receptors present brain areas.

drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral
interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry

podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried

world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion

something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel

this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area

Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing

meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat

think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find

fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire

relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating

don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

habits sake anorexic. also types mechanisms one
want incorporate order rewire habit kind. two main
features thinking go sorts habits anorexics execute. first
something called weak central coherence. Weak central coherence essentially
inability see forest trees. hyper acuity focus details within

involves something akin kind Waldo type puzzle, image
put up. one saw one big array coffee beans.
Actually, brown coffee beans. job identify array
coffee beans, face. indeed face embedded there. looks
little bit like coffee bean, see it, realize face, not coffee bean.
becomes hard not notice face that. Anorexics, good
identifying face. find much faster non-anorexics, really
interesting, right? somehow able hone details find details
fixate details. Now eventually, most, not people find face,
will find everyone finds can't unfine face, just
jumps out. So, essentially lost ability see whole picture,
detail within picture obsessed by. So, kind
elements obsessive compulsive disorder, not really obsessive compulsive

particular feature. miss big picture. challenge set shifting
identify something particular interest driving sort
reward, anorexic identifying high-fat foods identifying one
food table one eat without anyone, hopefully noticing eating
just green beans not touching food. ever meal

Actually go lot elaborate procedures kind hide food too.
sometimes even chew food, hold mouth go bathroom
discard things, elaborate, troubling types things hear about,

Now, people live alone, isn't available them. isn't kind thing
share coworkers. might involve close friend spouse, not
sort thing people don't live family context can really benefit from.
things fall umbrella cognitive behavioral therapy.
mention cognitive behavioral therapies often done conjunction
pharmacologic therapies. think idea either,
often both. So, cognitive behavioral often combined habit recognition
rewiring approach, starting become common. think

includes family model, least habit reformulation seems fairly effective.

01:35:39 MDMA, Psilocybin, Clinical Trials, Ibogaine

present might effective treatment. Now additional
treatments starting surface, takes us realm chemical treatments
anorexia. just want mention clinical trials, meaning legal clinical
trials done Johns Hopkins School Medicine Matthew Johnson others,
exploring drugs like MDMA, increases dopamine serotonin high
levels siliciden so-called magic mushrooms, increases serotonin
compounds high levels within confines professionally supported

emphasize clinical trials, compounds not yet legal.
many cases, cases still illegal. not think explored
without properly trained medical doctor, clinical trials essential complete
one explores compounds particular, lately get lot emails

get equal number emails people saying worked self

not passing judgment compounds people sort

serious compounds. can open plasticity, whether not
work quote unquote different types eating disorders depression trauma,
data looking promising, clinical trials still not done. know
number people going U.S. countries stuff

called ibogaine treatments. familiar eating disorders will
immediately asking, well, ibogaine? work? work? Well,
clinical trials country not complete. heard evidence direct. heard
directly people benefited sorts things, treatment eating
disorders. also heard people developed chronic seizure disorders
pursuing things like ibogaine treatment eating disorders. So, again,
not passing judgment. just like see data. important
safety aspects safety place. So, definitely not something get renegade
about. So, appears anorexia established habit breaking
self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,
processes, et cetera. leads us place short answer no, can't
simply say break habit. individual needs informed habit
comes from. fact currently seems like rewarded habit actually
punished habit. Now, don't mean actual punishment, mean within
brain, switch anorexic needs learn
switch rewarding now punished
punished. Starvation now rewarded. beauty human
knowledge knowledge can allow make better decisions. say again,
beauty human knowledge knowledge can allow make
better decisions. Now, course, anxious, tired,
intoxicated, less access ability use knowledge knowledge,
intervene. anorexic will often things keeping habits,


overexercising. area anyone treated anorexics interacted
anorexics well aware of, constantly moving. constantly
treadmill. constantly running. always want moving burning
calories, can feel okay interacting food
distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-
exercise induced thermogenesis people tend thin, tend bounce

overweight healthy mindset food, trying lose weight.
turns by, literally fidgeting bouncing around, like,
this. looks ridiculous. actually burn lot body fat calories. way provide


caloric deficit, burn body fat body fat not just passive

neat. described several decades now. actually pretty
terrific way burn off calories. So, anorexic, actually want
encourage not constantly trying burn off calories. can
challenging. So, shifting toward activities like weight bearing activities resistance
training promote

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode

anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe

overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face

least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning

anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need
eat. doesn't seem work. just don't see way
see them. offer point consideration, know someone
anorexic, look anorexic think, still critical
small, even nonexistent amount body fat triceps something?
that? Well, literally brain, relates perceptions, visual perceptions
particular, completely off.

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without

So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also

indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see

bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral

utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion

So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food

people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just

can start additional interventions way non invasive treatments, things like
drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral
interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry

podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got

world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty

this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't

just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area

Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know

Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing

not passing judgment. just like see data. important

self-awareness habits are, going primary entry point. might
seem kind trivial. might say, well, just told us one
sentence, want return us model homeostatic processes, reward,

distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just

Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit

common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue

many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,

indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see

bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called

leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used

unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without

dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle

trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging

Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar
prefrontal cortex. probably know prefrontal cortex ever

think. Okay, this, that, that, this, can imagine obsessive

think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing
cupboards ordering food. feeling horrible

feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young

impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper
limbic hypothalamic circuitry, things sort. Anytime feel like want

okay? explode burst say wrong thing, say thing
shouldn't say thing shouldn't do, lack prefrontal control.
indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.

distorted body image. Well, breaking habit mean

01:40:35 Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT

stop moving around exercising? No, not necessarily.
really interesting studies show shifting anorexics towards activities
instance, build muscle resistance training allow eat bit food without
necessarily losing weight, rather put muscle body can actually
beneficial. Now not talking anorexics becoming bodybuilders, body
dysmorphia associated bodybuilding, certain forms exercise just
catabolic. Meaning break amount muscle. reduce body weight,
overall, types exercises like resistance training anabolic, allow muscle
put on. interesting studies, not lot, interesting studies
trying encourage anorexics, not stop exercising, rather stop exercising
neurotic catabolic way breaking oneself down, rather getting shifted toward
breaking habits approaching low calorie, low fat foods, also encouraging
embark resistance training start learn reward relationship
exercise sake making one's body strong, including bones, not just
muscles, bones, important, especially anorexics. see food
way nourish process, building body stable weight.
Hopefully there, anorexic healthy weight maintaining

balancing whatever food intake activity. along lines that.
episode fat loss metabolism well, talked neat non-

800 2000 calories day. Now can beneficial folks
overweight healthy mindset food, trying lose weight.
turns by, literally fidgeting bouncing around, like,
this. looks ridiculous. actually burn lot body fat calories. way provide


caloric deficit, burn body fat body fat not just passive
tissue. actually receives input neurons release noradrenaline adrenaline.
neat. described several decades now. actually pretty
terrific way burn off calories. So, anorexic, actually want
encourage not constantly trying burn off calories. can
challenging. So, shifting toward activities like weight bearing activities resistance
training promote

01:43:23 Distorted Self Image Anorexia

anabolic type relationship activity, opposed catabolic can
beneficial. move talking bulimia related disorders,
want talk aspect anorexia. interesting, quite troubling fact,
received lot attention distorted self image. Now, episode
depression, talked powerful aspect major depression,
anti-self confabulation people depressed seem genuinely believe.
even confabulate fact performing poorly life
no good not, worthless, et cetera. literally lie believe
statements feelings behaviors start reflect lie. not
conscious it. call confabulation. Anorexics often will see
overweight imperfect ways obsession them, think, oh,
know, arms little bit fat, know, or, know, contour, face
makes don't like pictures they. describing
actually pretty typical behavior lot people. mean, many people know
take picture them, say, can see picture? tell
throw away. doesn't necessarily mean anorexic
suffering sort disorder. just means human
cares appear world. not judge case
anorexic. problem seems genuine distortion self
image much don't actually see accurately, visual
perceptions off. reason know this, really important
beautiful studies done colleague, Jeremy Bailenson's lab

Halpern mentioned earlier. really interesting studies


give us window perceptual defect anorexics have. actually done one
experiments. fortunate not anorexic, done work

relieving, say encouraging therapies
talked family based model, Connie behavioral treatments. Yes,
drug treatments well. habit intervention model one starts shift
things, appear perception self seems follow
perception self seems shift along change habits. relief,
least find reassuring changing one's perception actually hard,
somebody worked almost entire career visual perception related things.
perceptual apparatus brain not amenable neuroplasticity, meaning
don't change easily. Whereas appears circuitry related habit
formation, decision-making reward, circuitry, stuff can rewired.
anorexics progress anorexic state one,
intervening reflexes, gaining better habits around food, eating more,
accurately, assessing foods environments related food,
change behavior. start put healthy weight, maybe also
sorts exercises allow put healthy weight avoiding kind
extreme exercises cannibalism breaking down. also managed
somehow just consequence rewire perception self. So,
doesn't seem trying tell someone, oh gosh, thin. really need
eat. doesn't seem work. just don't see way
see them. offer point consideration, know someone
anorexic, look anorexic think, still critical
small, even nonexistent amount body fat triceps something?
that? Well, literally brain, relates perceptions, visual perceptions
particular, completely off.

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar
prefrontal cortex. probably know prefrontal cortex ever
wanted to, just episode, prefrontal cortex involved analysis duration
path outcome. Duration path outcome avoid impulsivity.
think. Okay, this, that, that, this, can imagine obsessive
compulsive anorexic, circuits overactive. bulimic
circuit going essentially underactive conditions
think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing
cupboards ordering food. feeling horrible
themselves. tend cycles binge purge followed
feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young
adult. So, really polar opposite see anorexia. So, lack
impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper
limbic hypothalamic circuitry, things sort. Anytime feel like want
say something really offensive don't, top-down control.
prefrontal cortex. Anytime someone says something like grow teeth.
'Cause know shouldn't say anything, gritting teeth top-dow control,
okay? explode burst say wrong thing, say thing
shouldn't say thing shouldn't do, lack prefrontal control.
indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called
adrenergic, norepinephrine levels brain allow top-down control.
also used treat ADHD attention deficit disorder. tend


create hyper-focus. tend push brain into, drugs tend create
hyper-focus, tend push brain general motor processing one
think this, that, this, that, anticipating outcomes.
reason, drugs like Wellbutrin, bupropion, antidepressant, mainly
increases amount dopamine norepinephrine less serotonin, can also

promoting smoking cessation depression, also certain forms obesity
related binge eating disorder. data pretty good. timed
release forms non-time release forms. think consult
psychiatrist order get prescribed prescription drugs,

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just
pump brakes little bit, no break, right? So, start going faster
faster faster. choice use accelerator just coach it.
essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern
others, think really exciting. even though highly invasive, think going
lead not just relief patients get deep brain stimulation,
also identification sorts receptors present brain areas.
help. means understand brain areas involved
disorder, understand receptors, brain areas express,
can start additional interventions way non invasive treatments, things like
drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral
interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,

Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid

way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid

number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain

Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep

appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies

obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling

hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic

So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things

podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively

world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel

this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

01:47:54 Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone

fortunately changing habits, rewire circuits well. Okay, talk


bulimia, overeating purging typically self-induced vomiting
ingestion laxatives, sometimes also concert people taking stimulants fat
burners, ingestion stimulus try burn off energy. also
talk binge eating disorder, lot features bulimia,
typically no purging. not going list off clinical criteria allow
someone diagnosed bulimic binge eating disorder. general features
ingest far calories need, anywhere 10 30 times,
daily caloric intake, oftentimes within two hour period, just staggering
amount food nutrients short period time. Oftentimes overriding
mechanical signals body full. really troubling thing
think about, people literally gorging food. looks lot like
laboratory animal AgRP neurons stimulated, neurons will eat
almost burst burst. So, wonder AgRP neurons
active almost certainly yes. involved. Although don't think going
major point intervention, going talk types
interventions. number clinical criteria. instance, somebody one
binges year, make bulimic? Technically, no,
certainly don't recommend people this. one people so-
called cheat days, right? may familiar cheat days. think
little less common now, idea eat clean six days five days week
two weeks. so-called cheat day just kind go wild
eat whatever want whatever volumes bulimia.
contour bulimia. vomiting afterwards binge eating disorder, not,
constitute full blown bulimia binge eating disorder? pretty hard say,
criteria described somebody least
month, period anywhere two three months, likely qualify.
certainly know people cheat days criteria,
something like binge eating disorder. general, one hallmark features
bulimia binge eating disorder people unable control eating.
just simply, not making decision cheat day. not making
decision overeat. simply driven inside without question way
neurocircuitry. driven inside ingest far food need.
cases want eat. So, lot like habit
described anorexia, almost like turned reflux get going,


homeostatic signals overridden, signals body, leptin,
insulin, glucose, stuff cosmically sky high. yet just we,
nerds call hyperphagic, just eating like crazy. So, going there?
Well, there've lot ideas, arises. so-called thyroid
hormone hypothesis. one's tricky one. turns cortisol thyroid
hormone concentrations vary according binge purge happened. So,
studies looked thyroid hormone levels found elevated thyroid
hormone levels. Thyroid hormone involved metabolism not just burning
energy, use energy converting different tissues body, cartilage
bone, fat, muscle, et cetera, whole episode thyroid growth hormone.
way, interested learning thyroid hormone, thyroid
hormone can also depleted phases binge purge cycle. Now, without
listing off terrible things happen binge purge cycle,
number things really worth pointing out. One vomiting itself, use
laxatives can cause severe disruption mucosal lining mucus lining
digestive tract can severely disrupt gut microbiome. can cause sorts even
ulceration esophagus just really terrible stuff. lot shame
associated bulimia, oftentimes people vomiting hard hide
vomiting behavior, people aware it. social isolation. So,
recall beginning, not appear sexual trauma

01:53:05 Inhibitory Control, Impulsivity, Adderall, Wellbutrin

prerequisite bulimia. Although sometimes can occur hallmark feature
bulimia distinguishes anorexia, aside fact overeating
opposed under-eating lack call inhibitory control. might
come no surprise. first all, bulimic, unlike anorexic hyper impulsive
oftentimes types impulse behaviors. might little bit
alcohol start eat like crazy. Whereas normally restrictive.
common feature bulimia, sometimes ingest alcohol binges.
Sometimes sexually promiscuous, not always, general issue
satiety start eating impulse control generally. reason,
many treatments see bulimia binge eating disorder sorts
treatments don't seem work well, least time anorexia.


So, drugs increase neuromodulator serotonin, instance, fluoxetine also
called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera. things oftentimes can effective bulimia.
drugs used treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADD,
topic going talk depth podcast soon,
drugs like Adderall, Vyvanse things sort can also used treat
bulimia binge eating disorder. work? Well now familiar
prefrontal cortex. probably know prefrontal cortex ever
wanted to, just episode, prefrontal cortex involved analysis duration
path outcome. Duration path outcome avoid impulsivity.
think. Okay, this, that, that, this, can imagine obsessive
compulsive anorexic, circuits overactive. bulimic
circuit going essentially underactive conditions
think, oh, know, shouldn't eat anything. shouldn't eat anything. just
tear refrigerator open plow that. point plowing
cupboards ordering food. feeling horrible
themselves. tend cycles binge purge followed
feelings real shame just can't control behavior.
embarrassing not able control one's behavior adult young
adult. So, really polar opposite see anorexia. So, lack
impulsivity implies lack prefrontal control. call top-down control.
call top-down? prefrontal cortex suppressing activity deeper
limbic hypothalamic circuitry, things sort. Anytime feel like want
say something really offensive don't, top-down control.
prefrontal cortex. Anytime someone says something like grow teeth.
'Cause know shouldn't say anything, gritting teeth top-dow control,
okay? explode burst say wrong thing, say thing
shouldn't say thing shouldn't do, lack prefrontal control.
indeed people frontotemporal dementia due aging head injuries, see
lot people play sports get lot frontal damage. become impulsive. So,
bulimics issue impulsivity, therefore drugs can increase serotonin.
sometimes drugs increase dopamine adrenaline also called
epinephrin, will increase tone call dopaminergic tone the, called
adrenergic, norepinephrine levels brain allow top-down control.
also used treat ADHD attention deficit disorder. tend


create hyper-focus. tend push brain into, drugs tend create

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just
pump brakes little bit, no break, right? So, start going faster
faster faster. choice use accelerator just coach it.
essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern
others, think really exciting. even though highly invasive, think going

also identification sorts receptors present brain areas.

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just
pump brakes little bit, no break, right? So, start going faster
faster faster. choice use accelerator just coach it.
essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern
others, think really exciting. even though highly invasive, think going
lead not just relief patients get deep brain stimulation,
also identification sorts receptors present brain areas.
help. means understand brain areas involved
disorder, understand receptors, brain areas express,
can start additional interventions way non invasive treatments, things like
drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral
interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

01:58:00 Direct Brain Stimulation: Nucleus Accumbens

different constellation neurochemicals brain areas approaches
bulimia. treatment binge eating disorder explored new
standpoint recently. work now, sadly, former colleague mine, Dr.
Casey Halpern, University Pennsylvania mentioned earlier,
using deep brain stimulation order treat binge-eating disorder. Now deep brain
stimulation? Well work Dr. Halpern others Stanford showed
particular patterns brain activity prefrontal cortex, also area
brain called nucleus accumbens, important relevant area
brain context, discussion motivated behaviors kind,
feeding, sex, drug relay behavior, people exercise compulsively, nucleus accumbens
ongoing dialogue prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens no
mind own, associated dopamine release. part so-called
reward pathway. Dr. Halpern colleagues discovered
particular patterns activity ripple brain, prefrontal
networks nucleus accumbens area, areas connected.
called Delta oscillations, Delta, just particular frequency electrical activity
aficionado wonderful heart activity. case, Delta oscillations
nucleus accumbens associated food reward mice humans.
Somehow reverberatory activity creates perception individual food
hyper rewarding. interesting, allowed use targeted deep
brain stimulation approach treat binge-eating disorder. deep brain stimulation


appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral
neuropathies metabolic issues. not getting enough
utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,
maybe 10 15 degree grade, heading figure, well, just
pump brakes little bit, no break, right? So, start going faster
faster faster. choice use accelerator just coach it.
essentially happening neural circuits. So, work Dr. Halpern
others, think really exciting. even though highly invasive, think going
lead not just relief patients get deep brain stimulation,
also identification sorts receptors present brain areas.
help. means understand brain areas involved
disorder, understand receptors, brain areas express,
can start additional interventions way non invasive treatments, things like
drug treatments, behavioral interventions work bulimia? cases, yes,
provided interventions done early enough. Regardless, behavioral
interventions, coupled drug based interventions always effective
either one alone. Fortunately, decent size kit drugs can help
bulimia. mentioned things

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used
treat impulsivity. So, one hand anorexia, seems disruption
habit coupling unhealthy habits case, food restriction reward
pathway. flip side, binge eating disorder bulimia
unhealthy habit gorging oneself food sometimes followed purging, not
necessarily coupled reward. feel terrible that, right? anorexic
feels great restricting food intake. feel like winning sort
game. circuitry flipped somehow way. bulimia feel horrible
fact bingeing, immense shame. can't control themselves.
reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
impulse break. no way stop kind behavior. So, really kind
troubling thing think about. either case, think us know anorexics
observed anorexia, hard see somebody starved near death


death. disturbing? Well, equally disturbing somebody
abundance

02:05:45 Healthy Eating Revisited

food gorging themselves, feels terrible it. So, heavy
topics. topics frankly no one really wants talk unless know
someone suffering them, suffer them.
tried today try give window really underlies things
call eating disorders. hope done level biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology, psychology, episode
podcast. especially month talking mental health issues
mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, no way can exhaustively
cover different forms treatment. modely approach, got
different approaches depression, anorexia, et cetera. tried
give framework. that, tried give framework
understanding also applies question. think equally important
goes alongside treatment eating disorders world healthy eating.
world healthy relationship food. like think healthy
relationship food. know foods like. enjoy them. 10 15 foods
particular liked much. mentioned podcast before,
sort amused, surprised perplexed why. instance, enjoy
eating butter, not huge amounts, like butter. So, seemed pretty
triggering folks there. small selection people decided ingestion
butter health concern. Look me, ingesting butter small quantities
something comfortable with. blood lipid profiles feel good. look
good me. people might not case. people. idea
eating animal-based food probably repulsive actually can make feel
physically sick. think aware kind mental phenotype
exists. not calling pathology people like myself, things like butter
meat feel healthy. Now, quantities? Well, enjoy eating much. not shy
this. talked podcast before, enjoy eating. people
complicated relationship food. don't think nourishment. don't
enjoy socially. stressful thing based personal history, maybe


just general anxiety around food. hope sharing information
fact anytime approach food, neurons hype, arcuate area
hypothalamus actually increase levels anxiety. related point
Dr. Halpern made, evolutionary standpoint, advantageous
ingest much food often possible, quickly possible. now know
not healthy age abundance, calories essentially everywhere.
yet lot people feel anxious anticipation meal. useful them?
Well, whether not eating disorder not. clear developing
methods calm oneself presence anxiety fear inducing stimulus can
beneficial. talked episodes related stress, things like
physiological side inhale nose long exhale, things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help. data, lot studies showing
meditation practice can help people deal eating related anxiety disorders.
think general rule, trying avoid approaching meal sitting eat
anxious state probably good idea, realistic. often can that?
think us going circumstances rushing around trying
just eat head get meal. sit find
eating. one first times human evolution mostly eat
desire consume food, not need food. everybody go
fairly long period time, just ingesting water electrolytes. not
suggesting people that, face it. largely eat nowadays desire
eat, not need eat, yet need eat fairly regular basis. no
topic complicated nuanced food nutrition. particular,
relates eating disorders. So, major takeaways today are, asking
question, healthy eating us? develop relationship food
can enjoy food, hopefully socially own, not
neurotic compulsive it. intermittent fast, also applies,
right? What, know, God forbid, eat 30 minutes eating window
starts, mean? means something catastrophic, eating
disorder? don't know. Maybe anxiety disorder, explore.
don't manage eat five meals day obsession. Well, then,
know, thing applies.

appearing effective treatment. still studies need done.
Actually, think binge-eating disorder, can find criteria that.
contact Dr. Halpern he's. mentioned, moving University
Pennsylvania. recruiting patients studies time. studies
fairly invasive. involve FDA approved approach literally placing wire
area brain that, allows individual stimulate particular brain
area offset activity patterns lead elevated sense reward
food binge eating. data looked really promising. Now realize
invasive approach. Not everybody going willing wire inserted
brain, people suffer binge-eating disorder. great
exciting potential treatment. didn't tell many people
binge eating disorder obese point health greatly risk. Now,
obesity causes sorts shifts dialogue brain body.
recognize earlier discussion, instance, leptin signaling
disrupted. So, fat lots body fat, even though body fat secreting,
hormone leptin signal shut desire eat. receptors
leptin brain totally screwed up. signal eat there, signal
stop eating not there. So, again, accelerator brake, like,
accelerator always pushed down. brain stimulation approaches
seem able bypass that, course metabolic
syndromes problems excess levels body fat, things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes. mean, disturbing here, many
individuals, actually, know obese start getting bodily sores.
not just bedsores, skin sores disruptive them.
don't like sores. addition that, can get peripheral

utilization nutrients tissue, way insulin disrupted insulin
singling, actually certain portions limbs amputated,
yet continue overeat. So, not issue self-control can easily
dealt simply telling person, look, stop eating going
die, going legs amputated. Like anorexia, distortion
relationship food, homeostatic reward aspects disrupted.
So, unlike anorexia, seems habit based mechanism bulimia
binge eating disorder, something deep within neural circuitry causing food


hyper attractive break off. So, want develop empathy
people dealing with, consider this, like driving car, get onto grade,

02:04:28 Anorexia/Reward. vs Bulimia/Binging

like bupropion, Welbutrin serotonergic drugs drugs used

reward set behavior, reward set drawing food
making food look like something incredibly appetizing no
