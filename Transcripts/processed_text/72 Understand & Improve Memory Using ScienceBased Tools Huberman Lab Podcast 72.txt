podcast. first sponsor Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
cooling, heating, sleep tracking. Many times podcast talked
incredible relationship temperature sleep well temperature
wakefulness. Many people aren't aware this, waking morning part
consequence body heating up. falling asleep night remaining
deep sleep part consequence body temperature dropping one
three degrees. vitally important temperature sleeping environment
controlled. trouble years falling staying asleep. say,
falling asleep hasn't much issue me, waking two three four
hours later issue. Often times warm, need open window.
need adjust temperature room on. Eight Sleep mattress covers
terrific can program specific patterns temperature want
bed, say you, coming mattress, throughout night.
programmed Eight Sleep put mattress state coolness order
fall asleep. get slightly cooler night goes on. get even deeper
sleep. warm morning approaches. Now, mentioned before, Eight
Sleep mattresses can used cooling heating. may actually
need heat mattress Eight Sleep's terrific that. me, use Eight Sleep
keep mattress really cool. say, even though thought sleeping
pretty well before, not experienced sort sleep getting

memory. talk get better remembering things. Now order
address things need little bit brain science 101 review.
promise will take two minutes. promise even don't
background biology, will make sense. constantly bombarded
physical stimuli. Patterns touch skin, light eyes, light skin,
matter. Smells, tastes, sound waves. fact, can hear saying right
now, well, consequence sound waves arriving ears
headphones, computer, speaker device. one
sensory stimuli converted electricity chemical signals so-called
nervous system. brain, spinal cord, connections organs
body. connections organs body back brain
spinal cord. One primary jobs nervous system, fact, convert
physical events world non-negotiable, right? Photons light photons
light. Sound waves sound waves. no changing that. nervous
system change that. converts things electrical signals chemical
signals language nervous system. Now just
bombarded sensory information converted language
neurons rest nervous system can understand, not mean
aware all. fact, going perceive small amount sensory
information. instance, can hear speaking right now perceiving
voice also, likely, neglecting feeling contact skin
whichever surface happen sitting standing on. perceiving
subset, small fraction sensory events environment, can make
sense world around us. Otherwise just overwhelmed
things happening one given moment. Now memory simply bias
perceptions will replayed future. Anytime experience
something, consequence specific chains neurons, call neural
circuits, activated. memory simply bias likelihood specific chain
neurons will activated again. instance, can remember name
certainly hope can, well, means specific chains neurons
brain represent name neurons connect one another
communicate electrically one another particular sequence, remember


name. particular chain neurons disrupted, not able
remember name. Now might seem immensely simple, raises really
interesting question talked before. is, remember
certain things not others? according just said, go
life, experiencing things time. constantly bombarded
sensory stimuli. sensory stimuli perceive,
perceptions get stamped memories. Today going teach
certain things get stamped memories. going teach

00:11:12 Context & Memory Formation

leverage process order remember information want far better.
Now, even though told memory simply bias likelihood
particular chain neurons will activated particular sequence again,
doesn't operate own. fact, remember takes place context
events. instance, can likely remember name yet
probably not thinking first learned name. generally
happens very, young children. yet, guessing
probably remember time someone mispronounced name, made fun
name. Or, case me, got 3rd grade two Andrews.
sadly me, lost coin flip allowed keep Andrew. 3rd
grade 12th grade people called Andy. really not prefer.
call Andy comments, delete comment. Just kidding, doesn't bother
much. eventually reclaimed Andrew name. Well, mine
begin throughout, started going Andrew again. say this? Well,
whole context name me. may not whole context
name you. presumably, asked parents named
given name, get context, etc. context reflects activation neural
circuits also related events life. Not just name, probably
siblings names parents are. on, on, on. so, way
memory works individual thing remember want
remember linked something either close, medium, distant
association. turns immensely important. know many will read
will encounter programs designed help enhance memory. know,


phenoms can remember 50 names room full people.
can remember bunch names novel objects maybe even different languages,
often times done association. people will come little mental
tricks either link sound word meaning word way
meaningful will enhance memory. can done impressive
see can that, congratulations. us can't
that, least requires lot effort training. However, things
can leverage natural biology nervous system enhance

00:13:46 Tool: Repetition, Improving Learning & Memory

learning memory particular perceptions, particular information. first just
talk basic ways learn remember things improve
learning memory. basic one repetition. Now study memory
role repetition actually dates back late 1800s, early 1900s
Ebbinghaus developed first so-called learning curves. Now learning curves
simply results quantify many repetitions something required
order remember something. fact, said Ebbinghaus liberated
understanding learning philosophers generating learning curves.
mean that? Well, Ebbinghaus came along, learning memory
thought philosophical ideas. Ebbinghaus came along said, well,
actually take measurements. measure well can remember sequence
words sequence numbers just repeat them. Ebbinghaus
take sequence numbers, words page read them.
take separate sheet paper. presume didn't cheat,
write many try keep
sequence. compare original list see
many errors made. over, over, again.
expect, early training learning took lot repetitions get
sequence correct. time, took fewer sequences. referred
difference initial number repetitions perform versus later
number repetitions perform so-called savings. literally thought
brain generate kind currency effort. talked
savings reduction amount effort put forward order


learn information. got learning curve. can imagine
learning curve looked like. sharp peak beginning dropped off
time. course, remembered meaningless information. even
though information might meaningless, experiment
Ebbinghaus demonstrated immensely meaningful. said
repetition can activate particular sequences neurons repeated
activation lays call memory. might seem like big duh,
prior Ebbinghaus, none known. Now, also say Ebbinghaus,
alive, not aware things called neural
circuits. 1906 Golgi Cajal got Nobel prize actually showing
neurons independent cells connected synapses, little gaps
communicate. may aware that, whole notion
neural circuits hadn't really come about. Nevertheless, Ebbinghaus learning
curves really established sheer repetition, just repeating things
sufficient learn. Something no doubt observed
never formally quantified. Now, look result, something
really important lies little bit cryptic, not obvious people. is,
information trying learn wasn't interesting second time
first, probably even less interesting less less interesting
repetition.

00:17:11 Co-Activation intensity Neuron Activation

yet sheer repetition allowed remember. Now sometime later
early mid 1920s, psychologist Canada named Donald Hebb came
called Hebb's postulate. Hebb's postulate, broadly speaking, idea
sequence neurons active time, roughly time,
lead strengthening connections neurons. many,
many decades experimentation later now know postulate true. Neurons
not smart, don't knowledge. every memory
consequence, told before, repeated activation particular chain
neurons. Ebbinghaus showed repetition Donald Hebb
proposed eventually verified experimentation animals humans
encourage co-activation neurons. Meaning neurons fire


roughly time, will strengthen connections. leads bias
probability neurons will active again. Now, vitally important
nowadays hear lot memories consequence new neurons
added brain. every time learn something, new connection
brain forms. Well, sorry break you, simply not case.
time, want emphasize most, not time learn
something existing neurons, not new neurons, existing neurons
strengthen connections co-activation over.
repetition or, important or, strong activation
once. fact, something called one trial learning whereby experience
something will remember thing forever. often associated
negative events, explain minutes. can also associated
positive events. Like first time saw romantic partner. something
happened romantic partner. first time saw child.
positive event, well extremely negative event. again,
repetition, guess label intensity. really mean say
intensity strong activation neurons can lay traces, circuits
far likely active again, not repetition not strong
activation circuits. mind, return original contrarian
question raised before. is, remember anything? Everyday
wake up, neurons brain body active. Different neural circuits
active. yet, remember small fraction things happen day.
yet, retain lot information previous days days
on. lot repetition extremely strong activation given
neural circuit will create new memories. minutes explain
get extremely strong activation particular neural circuits. Repetition pretty
obvious. Repetition repetition. minutes illustrate whole set
experiments whole set tools point can get extra strong
activation given neural circuit relates learning will remember
information, perhaps not just one trial learning,

00:20:50 Different Types Memory

certainly far fewer repetitions required otherwise. go


want preface discussion saying lot different
kinds memory. fact, take voyage neuroscience,
psychology memory find immense number different terms describe
immense number different types memory researchers focus on.
sake today's discussion, really just want focus short term memory, medium
term memory, longterm memory. still debate, always
case scientists, frankly, exact divisions short term, medium,
longterm memory, can broadly define short term memory longterm memory.
can describe couple different types think can relate
everyday life. common form short term memory going focus
called working memory. Working memory ability keep chain numbers
mind period time expectation really isn't remember
numbers next day certainly not next week. good example
phone number. tell ya phone number, 493-2938, well
probably remember it. 493-2938. came back tomorrow asked repeat
chain numbers, likely not. Unless, course, used particular
tool stamp memory mind commit longterm memory. Now
course, day age, people phone numbers programmed
phone don't really remember exact numbers. usually done
contact identity forth. different example probably
familiar security codes. try log unto app website
asks security code sent text messages can
either plug directly cases, remember short sequence
anywhere usually six seven, sometimes eight numbers. ability that,
switch back forth web pages apps plug number
remembering sequence plugging in, texting keying
keyboard, really good example working memory. Longterm memory,
sort going talking lot today ability commit certain
patterns information, either cognitive information motor information. Right,
ability move limbs particular sequence. long periods time.
remember day, week, month, maybe even year several
years later. got short term memory longterm memory. got
working memory sort keeping something online discarding okay. Not
online computer, online within brain. also two major categories


memory like know about. One explicit memory. not
necessarily explicit sort used thinking about. rather fact
can declare know something. explicit memory name.
Presumably explicit memory house apartment grew
in. know something know know it. can declare it. can
ask you, color first car owned? color
romantic partner's hair? sorts things. explicit declarative memory.
also explicit procedural memories. Now procedural memories, name
suggests, involve action sequences. simplest one, almost ridiculously simple,
walking. say, walk one room other? probably say,
well, go direction turn left. say, no, no, no. exactly
it? say, well, move left foot, right foot, left foot.
describe that. explicit procedural memory. much going
teach young toddler walk, probably say okay, good, good, try.
Okay, know, probably going pre-language toddler.
going encourage move one leg other. going encourage
reward moving one leg other. explicit
procedural memory walk. Okay, almost ridiculously simple. Maybe even truly
ridiculously simple, nonetheless, think context neural
circuits neural firing, pretty amazing. Even amazing fact explicit
memories, declarative procedural explicit memories can moved explicit
implicit. mean that? Well, example walking might
chuckled little bit kind shook head said, ridiculous thing ask.
walk one room next? just walk. just it. Ah, well, just
it? is, implicit understanding. Meaning nervous system
knows walk without actually think

00:25:40 Memory Formation Brain, Hippocampus

know walk. just get chair get
bed walk. brain structure. fact, one side
brain. called hippocampus. hippocampus literally means seahorse.
Anatomists like name brain structures things think brain
structures resemble. look hippocampus, frankly, doesn't look like


seahorse. either reflects lack understanding seahorse really looks
like, visual deficit, think fair say anatomists using little bit
creative elaboration thinking hippocampus looks like. Nonetheless,
curved structure. many layers. described colleague Robert
Sapolsky others looking like jelly roll cinnamon roll, looks
like me. take one cinnamon roll, chop middle. now
got two half cinnamon rolls rather put back together
configuration before, just slide one got essentially two
C's. Two C-shaped halves cinnamon roll push together, right,
slightly off set one another. Well, hippocampus looks like me.
think far better description actual physical structure. guess
use physical structure name, well open brain
atlas called two half-C cinnamon rolls stuffed halfway together.
not good. guess, seahorse will work. Hippocampus name
structure site brain, again, one side
brain, explicit declarative memories formed. not memories
stored maintained. established first place. contrast,
implicit memories, subconscious memories, formed stored elsewhere
brain. Mainly areas like cerebellum, also neocortex, kind outer shell
brain. cerebellum literally means mini-brain. fact look like
mini-brain. back brain. neocortex outer part
brain covers stuff. So, hippocampus vitally important

00:28:00 Hippocampus, Role Memory & Learning, Explicit vs. Implicit Memory

establishing new, declarative memories know know
do. Now, order really understand role hippocampus memory,
particular explicit declarative, explicit procedural memory really understand
distinct implicit declarative implicit procedural memories
look clinical case. clinical case referring patient went
name HM. Patient's go initials order maintain confidentiality real
identity. HM called intractable epilepsy. really
dramatic, so-called grand mal seizures, drop seizures. know
somebody epilepsy, epilepsy, might familiar this. can


petite mal seizures, minor seizures. can tonic clonic seizures,
sometimes not even detectable. can absent seizures people
will just stop, almost brain kind goes pause just stop there.
reported actually Einstein absent seizures. Although don't know
ever really confirmed neurologically. Grand mal seizures extremely severe
HM had. just going day maybe even cooking,
something, driving, operating kind machinery, sudden
just drop seizure. just physically drop go grand
mal seizure. convulsing whole body, loss consciousness, etc.
feel coming on. Often times people epilepsy can feel epileptic seizure coming
on. Kind like wave back brain. sometimes can get safe
circumstance, not always. frequency intensity seizures
robust neurosurgeons neurologists decided needed
locate origin, call foci seizures, remove brain tissue.
way seizures work spread focus, foci brain
tissue. unfortunately HM, focus seizures hippocampus.
lot deliberation, neurosurgeon, fact one famous neurosurgeons
world time, made called electrolytic lesions, actually burned
hippocampus brain HM. consequence, lost explicit memory.
Now consequence couldn't exist normal, everyday life, like
people. live mostly, not entirely, mostly kind hospital
setting. talked several people, say, met HM directly,
no longer alive. interaction might look like following.
walk just fine. wouldn't know kind brain damage.
walk fine, speak fine. say, hi, Andrew. say, hi,
whatever name happened be. wouldn't say HM, probably say
real name. perhaps someone new walk room. might turn
around, look person, us might do. turn around back
say, hi, name? say, well, just told name.
just told name, remember that? say, sorry, don't
remember that. name? go again.
complete lack explicit declarative memory. Now memory
previous events life dated way back, okay. Again, hinting idea
memories not necessarily stored hippocampus, just formed


hippocampus. moved hippocampus brain areas,
still keep memories. different database, will.
different pattern firing

00:31:49 Emotion & Memory Enhancement

neural circuits. couldn't form new memories. Now
important interesting twists HM not terms learning
memory teach us lot brain. fact, think neuroscientists
agree unfortunate case HM's epilepsy subsequent neuro
surgery taught us much know, least think about, terms
human learning memory. instance, mentioned before, still implicit
knowledge. knew walk. knew certain things like make cup
coffee. knew names people met much earlier life, on.
yet couldn't form new memories. Now, violation last statement,
elements HM's emotionality suggests sort
residual capacity learn new information wasn't normally think
explicit declarative procedural memory. instance, reported
said, say, don't know studies ever done intense
physiological measurements, tell HM joke, thought
funny, laugh really hard. liked jokes, say hey, HM, want tell
joke. tell joke laugh really hard. leave
room, come back, tell joke again. Now keep mind, not
remember told joke previously. second time laugh
little bit less. leave room, come back again. Say hi, Andrew.
say, oh, nice meet you. know, recall, can
recall things. couldn't recall things. didn't know just met you.
least couldn't remember it. tell joke third time, fourth time,
subsequent telling joke found little less funny. Just as, keep
mind, folks, tell joke get big laugh, don't tell again. least not
immediately. Not person crowd second time
little less funny third time little less funny. actually
whole element dopamine relationship surprise. topic
future podcast talk humor novelty brain. point


certain forms memory seem exist kind phantom like way within
HM's brain. mean that? Well, underscores implicit
memory heard joke before. suggests humor, least
find funny, somehow related procedures. Similar walking motor ability
precise content joke. right, little bit abstract
concept, point HM lacked explicit declarative memory. couldn't tell
just heard. not learn new information. couldn't tell
something unless learned something many years prior. Now,
lot patients besides HM brain lesions due
epilepsy, say due surgeries treat epilepsy, due strokes, due sadly
gunshot wounds forms call infarcts, infarct. I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct
word use describe damage particular brain region. many different
patients many different patterns infarct taught us lot memory
aspects brain work. HM really teaches us know
able consequence things aware learnings
passed off subconscious knowledge, body knows. brain
knows, don't know exactly know thing. tell story
HM's ability understand joke, repeated telling joke less
less less impact creating sense laughter, humor HM. Not just
anecdote flesh story, emotion turns way
can enhance memories even memories things not
funny, not intensely sad, not immensely happy don't evoke really strong
emotional response, even emotional response. reason
emotions, just like perception, just like sensation, consequence particular
neuro chemicals present brain body. going tell next,
particular neuro chemicals can leverage order learn specific
information faster remember much longer period time, maybe even
forever. can leveraging relationship nervous system

00:36:44 Tool: Emotion Saliency & Improved Memory

brain body. body back brain. talk
tools enhancing memory. Now one tool absolutely clear works.
always worked, works now, will work forever. repetition.


often perform something recite something, likely
remember future. might seem obvious, worth thinking
happening repeat something. say happening, mean
neural level. happening encouraging firing particular
chains neurons reside particular circuit, right. particular sequence
neurons playing neuron A, B, C, D played particular sequence
again. repetitions, get strengthening nerve
connections. Now, repetition works problem people either don't
patience, don't time, sometimes literally don't
time got deadline something trying remember
learn. simply like able remember things better general
remember quickly. process accelerating repetition based learning
learning curve doesn't go perform something 1,000 times
gradually time 1,000, 750 times day, 500 times day, 300 times day,
no repetitions, right? can just perform thing first time every
time. Well, way shift curve can essentially establish stronger
connections neurons involved generating memory
behavior quickly. that? Well, order answer
look beautiful work James McGaugh Larry Cahill. James McGaugh
Larry Cahill number experiments several decades really based lot
animal literature, mainly focused humans really established required
get better remembering things quickly. want talk one
experiment particularly important. will provide link
paper, years old now, results still hold up. fact, results
established entire field memory neuroscience psychology.
human subjects come laboratory read short paragraph
12 sentences. key thing subjects read paragraph
pretty mundane. content, information within paragraph related
content previous sentence. cogent paragraph. Right, just wasn't
meaningless scramble words. described kind mundane set
circumstances. Maybe story someone walked room, sat
desk, wrote little bit, got lunch. know, just kind
mundane information. Not interesting. Another group subjects read also 12
sentence paragraph. paragraph included subset sentences lot


emotionally intense language. language evoke emotionally
intense response person reading it. might talked car accident
intense surgery. also positive stuff. Things like birthday party,
celebration kind. big sports win. words, two
conditions study. People either read boring paragraph, read really
emotionally laden paragraph. again, emotions either positive
negative emotions. Subjects left laboratory sometime later called back
laboratory say, no point experiment know
part memory experiment. Okay, don't even know reading
paragraph. came either class credit get paid. typically
things done college campuses elsewhere. come back lab
get pop quiz. asked recall content paragraph
read previously. Now probably expected, perhaps even obvious
you, subjects read emotionally intense paragraph remembered far
content paragraph far accurate remembering
information. Now, particular finding wasn't novel. Many people previously
described emotionally intense events better remembered non-emotionally
intense events. fact, way back 1600s Francis Bacon, largely credited
developing scientific method, said, quote, memory assisted anything
makes impression powerful passion. Inspiring fear, example, wonder,
shame, joy.

00:41:42 Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline

Francis Bacon said 1620. Jim McGaugh Larry Cahill certainly not
first demonstrate conceive idea emotionally laden experiences
easily remembered experiences. However, next
immensely important understanding memory building tools
enhance learning memory. evaluated capacity stress
particular neuro chemicals associated stress improve ability learn
information. Not just information emotional, information kinds.
going describe experiments done animal models just briefly,
experiments done humans subjects. McGaugh worked mainly animals,
also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively human subjects. take


rat mouse put arena one location animal receives
electrical shock come back next day, remove shock evoking
device let animal move around arena, animal will, quite
understandably, avoid location shocked. called conditioned place
aversion. affect avoiding particular location occurs one trial. good
example one trial learning. somehow animal knows shocked
location, remembers that. hippocampal dependent learning. animals lack
hippocampus hippocampus pharmacologically otherwise
incapacitated, will not learn new bit information. animals do,
remember first time every time. Unless, block release
certain chemicals brain body chemicals referring
epinephrine, adrenaline, extent corticosterones. Things like cortisol.
Now know effect getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine,
least particular experimental scenario. researchers exact
experiment, done exact experiment, introduce
pharmacological blocker epinephrine, epinephrine released response
shock, cannot actually bind receptors biological effects,
well animal perfectly happy tread back area received
shock. almost didn't know, assume, didn't remember
received shock location. seems pretty obvious hear it.
Something bad happens location, don't go back location.
condition place avoidance. turns opposite also true. Meaning
something called condition place preference can take animal, put arena,
feed reward one location arena. can give hungry rat
mouse food one particular location, take animal out, come back next day.
No food introduced, will go back location received food.
can variant this. can make arena little bit chilly provide
warmth location. can take male animal. turns male rats
mice will mate point. female animal particular called receptive
phase mating cycle give opportunity mate give location,
go back location wait away. perhaps people go back
bar, seat bar, restaurant wait one time they,
know, things worked them. Whatever context was. Condition place
preference. Condition place preference condition place avoidance depends


release adrenaline, right. not just stress. heightened
emotional state brain body. Okay, really important. not just
stress. can get one trial learning positive events, condition place preference.
can get one trial learning negative events. say positive negative,
putting called valence it. Making value judgment whether not
animal liked didn't like it. presume animal liked didn't like
felt. turns true humans well. know
McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data
epinephrine release, better people remembered material.

know number probably drinking cup coffee cup yerba
mate maybe even energy drink taking Alpha GPC something
physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start

particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise

really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer

affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise

cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human

subset, small fraction sensory events environment, can make
sense world around us. Otherwise just overwhelmed
things happening one given moment. Now memory simply bias
perceptions will replayed future. Anytime experience
something, consequence specific chains neurons, call neural
circuits, activated. memory simply bias likelihood specific chain
neurons will activated again. instance, can remember name
certainly hope can, well, means specific chains neurons
brain represent name neurons connect one another
communicate electrically one another particular sequence, remember


name. particular chain neurons disrupted, not able
remember name. Now might seem immensely simple, raises really
interesting question talked before. is, remember
certain things not others? according just said, go
life, experiencing things time. constantly bombarded
sensory stimuli. sensory stimuli perceive,
perceptions get stamped memories. Today going teach
certain things get stamped memories. going teach

00:11:12 Context & Memory Formation

leverage process order remember information want far better.
Now, even though told memory simply bias likelihood
particular chain neurons will activated particular sequence again,
doesn't operate own. fact, remember takes place context
events. instance, can likely remember name yet
probably not thinking first learned name. generally
happens very, young children. yet, guessing
probably remember time someone mispronounced name, made fun
name. Or, case me, got 3rd grade two Andrews.
sadly me, lost coin flip allowed keep Andrew. 3rd
grade 12th grade people called Andy. really not prefer.
call Andy comments, delete comment. Just kidding, doesn't bother
much. eventually reclaimed Andrew name. Well, mine
begin throughout, started going Andrew again. say this? Well,
whole context name me. may not whole context
name you. presumably, asked parents named
given name, get context, etc. context reflects activation neural
circuits also related events life. Not just name, probably
siblings names parents are. on, on, on. so, way
memory works individual thing remember want
remember linked something either close, medium, distant
association. turns immensely important. know many will read
will encounter programs designed help enhance memory. know,


phenoms can remember 50 names room full people.
can remember bunch names novel objects maybe even different languages,
often times done association. people will come little mental
tricks either link sound word meaning word way
meaningful will enhance memory. can done impressive
see can that, congratulations. us can't
that, least requires lot effort training. However, things
can leverage natural biology nervous system enhance

00:13:46 Tool: Repetition, Improving Learning & Memory

learning memory particular perceptions, particular information. first just
talk basic ways learn remember things improve
learning memory. basic one repetition. Now study memory
role repetition actually dates back late 1800s, early 1900s
Ebbinghaus developed first so-called learning curves. Now learning curves
simply results quantify many repetitions something required
order remember something. fact, said Ebbinghaus liberated
understanding learning philosophers generating learning curves.
mean that? Well, Ebbinghaus came along, learning memory
thought philosophical ideas. Ebbinghaus came along said, well,
actually take measurements. measure well can remember sequence
words sequence numbers just repeat them. Ebbinghaus
take sequence numbers, words page read them.
take separate sheet paper. presume didn't cheat,
write many try keep
sequence. compare original list see
many errors made. over, over, again.
expect, early training learning took lot repetitions get
sequence correct. time, took fewer sequences. referred
difference initial number repetitions perform versus later
number repetitions perform so-called savings. literally thought
brain generate kind currency effort. talked
savings reduction amount effort put forward order


learn information. got learning curve. can imagine
learning curve looked like. sharp peak beginning dropped off
time. course, remembered meaningless information. even
though information might meaningless, experiment
Ebbinghaus demonstrated immensely meaningful. said
repetition can activate particular sequences neurons repeated
activation lays call memory. might seem like big duh,
prior Ebbinghaus, none known. Now, also say Ebbinghaus,
alive, not aware things called neural
circuits. 1906 Golgi Cajal got Nobel prize actually showing
neurons independent cells connected synapses, little gaps
communicate. may aware that, whole notion
neural circuits hadn't really come about. Nevertheless, Ebbinghaus learning
curves really established sheer repetition, just repeating things
sufficient learn. Something no doubt observed
never formally quantified. Now, look result, something
really important lies little bit cryptic, not obvious people. is,
information trying learn wasn't interesting second time
first, probably even less interesting less less interesting
repetition.

00:17:11 Co-Activation intensity Neuron Activation

yet sheer repetition allowed remember. Now sometime later
early mid 1920s, psychologist Canada named Donald Hebb came
called Hebb's postulate. Hebb's postulate, broadly speaking, idea
sequence neurons active time, roughly time,
lead strengthening connections neurons. many,
many decades experimentation later now know postulate true. Neurons
not smart, don't knowledge. every memory
consequence, told before, repeated activation particular chain
neurons. Ebbinghaus showed repetition Donald Hebb
proposed eventually verified experimentation animals humans
encourage co-activation neurons. Meaning neurons fire


roughly time, will strengthen connections. leads bias
probability neurons will active again. Now, vitally important
nowadays hear lot memories consequence new neurons
added brain. every time learn something, new connection
brain forms. Well, sorry break you, simply not case.
time, want emphasize most, not time learn
something existing neurons, not new neurons, existing neurons
strengthen connections co-activation over.
repetition or, important or, strong activation
once. fact, something called one trial learning whereby experience
something will remember thing forever. often associated
negative events, explain minutes. can also associated
positive events. Like first time saw romantic partner. something
happened romantic partner. first time saw child.
positive event, well extremely negative event. again,
repetition, guess label intensity. really mean say
intensity strong activation neurons can lay traces, circuits
far likely active again, not repetition not strong
activation circuits. mind, return original contrarian
question raised before. is, remember anything? Everyday
wake up, neurons brain body active. Different neural circuits
active. yet, remember small fraction things happen day.
yet, retain lot information previous days days
on. lot repetition extremely strong activation given
neural circuit will create new memories. minutes explain
get extremely strong activation particular neural circuits. Repetition pretty
obvious. Repetition repetition. minutes illustrate whole set
experiments whole set tools point can get extra strong
activation given neural circuit relates learning will remember
information, perhaps not just one trial learning,

00:20:50 Different Types Memory

certainly far fewer repetitions required otherwise. go


want preface discussion saying lot different
kinds memory. fact, take voyage neuroscience,
psychology memory find immense number different terms describe
immense number different types memory researchers focus on.
sake today's discussion, really just want focus short term memory, medium
term memory, longterm memory. still debate, always
case scientists, frankly, exact divisions short term, medium,
longterm memory, can broadly define short term memory longterm memory.
can describe couple different types think can relate
everyday life. common form short term memory going focus
called working memory. Working memory ability keep chain numbers
mind period time expectation really isn't remember
numbers next day certainly not next week. good example
phone number. tell ya phone number, 493-2938, well
probably remember it. 493-2938. came back tomorrow asked repeat
chain numbers, likely not. Unless, course, used particular
tool stamp memory mind commit longterm memory. Now
course, day age, people phone numbers programmed
phone don't really remember exact numbers. usually done
contact identity forth. different example probably
familiar security codes. try log unto app website
asks security code sent text messages can
either plug directly cases, remember short sequence
anywhere usually six seven, sometimes eight numbers. ability that,
switch back forth web pages apps plug number
remembering sequence plugging in, texting keying
keyboard, really good example working memory. Longterm memory,
sort going talking lot today ability commit certain
patterns information, either cognitive information motor information. Right,
ability move limbs particular sequence. long periods time.
remember day, week, month, maybe even year several
years later. got short term memory longterm memory. got
working memory sort keeping something online discarding okay. Not
online computer, online within brain. also two major categories


memory like know about. One explicit memory. not
necessarily explicit sort used thinking about. rather fact
can declare know something. explicit memory name.
Presumably explicit memory house apartment grew
in. know something know know it. can declare it. can
ask you, color first car owned? color
romantic partner's hair? sorts things. explicit declarative memory.
also explicit procedural memories. Now procedural memories, name
suggests, involve action sequences. simplest one, almost ridiculously simple,
walking. say, walk one room other? probably say,
well, go direction turn left. say, no, no, no. exactly
it? say, well, move left foot, right foot, left foot.
describe that. explicit procedural memory. much going
teach young toddler walk, probably say okay, good, good, try.
Okay, know, probably going pre-language toddler.
going encourage move one leg other. going encourage
reward moving one leg other. explicit
procedural memory walk. Okay, almost ridiculously simple. Maybe even truly
ridiculously simple, nonetheless, think context neural
circuits neural firing, pretty amazing. Even amazing fact explicit
memories, declarative procedural explicit memories can moved explicit
implicit. mean that? Well, example walking might
chuckled little bit kind shook head said, ridiculous thing ask.
walk one room next? just walk. just it. Ah, well, just
it? is, implicit understanding. Meaning nervous system
knows walk without actually think

00:25:40 Memory Formation Brain, Hippocampus

know walk. just get chair get
bed walk. brain structure. fact, one side
brain. called hippocampus. hippocampus literally means seahorse.
Anatomists like name brain structures things think brain
structures resemble. look hippocampus, frankly, doesn't look like


seahorse. either reflects lack understanding seahorse really looks
like, visual deficit, think fair say anatomists using little bit
creative elaboration thinking hippocampus looks like. Nonetheless,
curved structure. many layers. described colleague Robert
Sapolsky others looking like jelly roll cinnamon roll, looks
like me. take one cinnamon roll, chop middle. now
got two half cinnamon rolls rather put back together
configuration before, just slide one got essentially two
C's. Two C-shaped halves cinnamon roll push together, right,
slightly off set one another. Well, hippocampus looks like me.
think far better description actual physical structure. guess
use physical structure name, well open brain
atlas called two half-C cinnamon rolls stuffed halfway together.
not good. guess, seahorse will work. Hippocampus name
structure site brain, again, one side
brain, explicit declarative memories formed. not memories
stored maintained. established first place. contrast,
implicit memories, subconscious memories, formed stored elsewhere
brain. Mainly areas like cerebellum, also neocortex, kind outer shell
brain. cerebellum literally means mini-brain. fact look like
mini-brain. back brain. neocortex outer part
brain covers stuff. So, hippocampus vitally important

00:28:00 Hippocampus, Role Memory & Learning, Explicit vs. Implicit Memory

establishing new, declarative memories know know
do. Now, order really understand role hippocampus memory,
particular explicit declarative, explicit procedural memory really understand
distinct implicit declarative implicit procedural memories
look clinical case. clinical case referring patient went
name HM. Patient's go initials order maintain confidentiality real
identity. HM called intractable epilepsy. really
dramatic, so-called grand mal seizures, drop seizures. know
somebody epilepsy, epilepsy, might familiar this. can


petite mal seizures, minor seizures. can tonic clonic seizures,
sometimes not even detectable. can absent seizures people
will just stop, almost brain kind goes pause just stop there.
reported actually Einstein absent seizures. Although don't know
ever really confirmed neurologically. Grand mal seizures extremely severe
HM had. just going day maybe even cooking,
something, driving, operating kind machinery, sudden
just drop seizure. just physically drop go grand
mal seizure. convulsing whole body, loss consciousness, etc.
feel coming on. Often times people epilepsy can feel epileptic seizure coming
on. Kind like wave back brain. sometimes can get safe
circumstance, not always. frequency intensity seizures
robust neurosurgeons neurologists decided needed
locate origin, call foci seizures, remove brain tissue.
way seizures work spread focus, foci brain
tissue. unfortunately HM, focus seizures hippocampus.
lot deliberation, neurosurgeon, fact one famous neurosurgeons
world time, made called electrolytic lesions, actually burned
hippocampus brain HM. consequence, lost explicit memory.
Now consequence couldn't exist normal, everyday life, like
people. live mostly, not entirely, mostly kind hospital
setting. talked several people, say, met HM directly,
no longer alive. interaction might look like following.
walk just fine. wouldn't know kind brain damage.
walk fine, speak fine. say, hi, Andrew. say, hi,
whatever name happened be. wouldn't say HM, probably say
real name. perhaps someone new walk room. might turn
around, look person, us might do. turn around back
say, hi, name? say, well, just told name.
just told name, remember that? say, sorry, don't
remember that. name? go again.
complete lack explicit declarative memory. Now memory
previous events life dated way back, okay. Again, hinting idea
memories not necessarily stored hippocampus, just formed


hippocampus. moved hippocampus brain areas,
still keep memories. different database, will.
different pattern firing

00:31:49 Emotion & Memory Enhancement

neural circuits. couldn't form new memories. Now
important interesting twists HM not terms learning
memory teach us lot brain. fact, think neuroscientists
agree unfortunate case HM's epilepsy subsequent neuro
surgery taught us much know, least think about, terms
human learning memory. instance, mentioned before, still implicit
knowledge. knew walk. knew certain things like make cup
coffee. knew names people met much earlier life, on.
yet couldn't form new memories. Now, violation last statement,
elements HM's emotionality suggests sort
residual capacity learn new information wasn't normally think
explicit declarative procedural memory. instance, reported
said, say, don't know studies ever done intense
physiological measurements, tell HM joke, thought
funny, laugh really hard. liked jokes, say hey, HM, want tell
joke. tell joke laugh really hard. leave
room, come back, tell joke again. Now keep mind, not
remember told joke previously. second time laugh
little bit less. leave room, come back again. Say hi, Andrew.
say, oh, nice meet you. know, recall, can
recall things. couldn't recall things. didn't know just met you.
least couldn't remember it. tell joke third time, fourth time,
subsequent telling joke found little less funny. Just as, keep
mind, folks, tell joke get big laugh, don't tell again. least not
immediately. Not person crowd second time
little less funny third time little less funny. actually
whole element dopamine relationship surprise. topic
future podcast talk humor novelty brain. point


certain forms memory seem exist kind phantom like way within
HM's brain. mean that? Well, underscores implicit
memory heard joke before. suggests humor, least
find funny, somehow related procedures. Similar walking motor ability
precise content joke. right, little bit abstract
concept, point HM lacked explicit declarative memory. couldn't tell
just heard. not learn new information. couldn't tell
something unless learned something many years prior. Now,
lot patients besides HM brain lesions due
epilepsy, say due surgeries treat epilepsy, due strokes, due sadly
gunshot wounds forms call infarcts, infarct. I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct
word use describe damage particular brain region. many different
patients many different patterns infarct taught us lot memory
aspects brain work. HM really teaches us know
able consequence things aware learnings
passed off subconscious knowledge, body knows. brain
knows, don't know exactly know thing. tell story
HM's ability understand joke, repeated telling joke less
less less impact creating sense laughter, humor HM. Not just
anecdote flesh story, emotion turns way
can enhance memories even memories things not
funny, not intensely sad, not immensely happy don't evoke really strong
emotional response, even emotional response. reason
emotions, just like perception, just like sensation, consequence particular
neuro chemicals present brain body. going tell next,
particular neuro chemicals can leverage order learn specific
information faster remember much longer period time, maybe even
forever. can leveraging relationship nervous system

00:36:44 Tool: Emotion Saliency & Improved Memory

brain body. body back brain. talk
tools enhancing memory. Now one tool absolutely clear works.
always worked, works now, will work forever. repetition.


often perform something recite something, likely
remember future. might seem obvious, worth thinking
happening repeat something. say happening, mean
neural level. happening encouraging firing particular
chains neurons reside particular circuit, right. particular sequence
neurons playing neuron A, B, C, D played particular sequence
again. repetitions, get strengthening nerve
connections. Now, repetition works problem people either don't
patience, don't time, sometimes literally don't
time got deadline something trying remember
learn. simply like able remember things better general
remember quickly. process accelerating repetition based learning
learning curve doesn't go perform something 1,000 times
gradually time 1,000, 750 times day, 500 times day, 300 times day,
no repetitions, right? can just perform thing first time every
time. Well, way shift curve can essentially establish stronger
connections neurons involved generating memory
behavior quickly. that? Well, order answer
look beautiful work James McGaugh Larry Cahill. James McGaugh
Larry Cahill number experiments several decades really based lot
animal literature, mainly focused humans really established required
get better remembering things quickly. want talk one
experiment particularly important. will provide link
paper, years old now, results still hold up. fact, results
established entire field memory neuroscience psychology.
human subjects come laboratory read short paragraph
12 sentences. key thing subjects read paragraph
pretty mundane. content, information within paragraph related
content previous sentence. cogent paragraph. Right, just wasn't
meaningless scramble words. described kind mundane set
circumstances. Maybe story someone walked room, sat
desk, wrote little bit, got lunch. know, just kind
mundane information. Not interesting. Another group subjects read also 12
sentence paragraph. paragraph included subset sentences lot


emotionally intense language. language evoke emotionally
intense response person reading it. might talked car accident
intense surgery. also positive stuff. Things like birthday party,
celebration kind. big sports win. words, two
conditions study. People either read boring paragraph, read really
emotionally laden paragraph. again, emotions either positive
negative emotions. Subjects left laboratory sometime later called back
laboratory say, no point experiment know
part memory experiment. Okay, don't even know reading
paragraph. came either class credit get paid. typically
things done college campuses elsewhere. come back lab
get pop quiz. asked recall content paragraph
read previously. Now probably expected, perhaps even obvious
you, subjects read emotionally intense paragraph remembered far
content paragraph far accurate remembering
information. Now, particular finding wasn't novel. Many people previously
described emotionally intense events better remembered non-emotionally
intense events. fact, way back 1600s Francis Bacon, largely credited
developing scientific method, said, quote, memory assisted anything
makes impression powerful passion. Inspiring fear, example, wonder,
shame, joy.

00:41:42 Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline

Francis Bacon said 1620. Jim McGaugh Larry Cahill certainly not
first demonstrate conceive idea emotionally laden experiences
easily remembered experiences. However, next
immensely important understanding memory building tools
enhance learning memory. evaluated capacity stress
particular neuro chemicals associated stress improve ability learn

going describe experiments done animal models just briefly,
experiments done humans subjects. McGaugh worked mainly animals,
also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively human subjects. take


rat mouse put arena one location animal receives
electrical shock come back next day, remove shock evoking
device let animal move around arena, animal will, quite
understandably, avoid location shocked. called conditioned place

McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning

beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline

adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve

third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things

absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit

sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts

Again, InsideTracker.com/Huberman get 20% off. Okay, talk
memory. talk get better remembering things. Now order
address things need little bit brain science 101 review.
promise will take two minutes. promise even don't
background biology, will make sense. constantly bombarded
physical stimuli. Patterns touch skin, light eyes, light skin,
matter. Smells, tastes, sound waves. fact, can hear saying right
now, well, consequence sound waves arriving ears
headphones, computer, speaker device. one
sensory stimuli converted electricity chemical signals so-called
nervous system. brain, spinal cord, connections organs

spinal cord. One primary jobs nervous system, fact, convert
physical events world non-negotiable, right? Photons light photons

bombarded sensory information converted language
neurons rest nervous system can understand, not mean
aware all. fact, going perceive small amount sensory
information. instance, can hear speaking right now perceiving
voice also, likely, neglecting feeling contact skin
whichever surface happen sitting standing on. perceiving
subset, small fraction sensory events environment, can make
sense world around us. Otherwise just overwhelmed
things happening one given moment. Now memory simply bias
perceptions will replayed future. Anytime experience
something, consequence specific chains neurons, call neural
circuits, activated. memory simply bias likelihood specific chain
neurons will activated again. instance, can remember name
certainly hope can, well, means specific chains neurons
brain represent name neurons connect one another
communicate electrically one another particular sequence, remember


name. particular chain neurons disrupted, not able
remember name. Now might seem immensely simple, raises really
interesting question talked before. is, remember
certain things not others? according just said, go
life, experiencing things time. constantly bombarded
sensory stimuli. sensory stimuli perceive,
perceptions get stamped memories. Today going teach
certain things get stamped memories. going teach

00:11:12 Context & Memory Formation

leverage process order remember information want far better.
Now, even though told memory simply bias likelihood
particular chain neurons will activated particular sequence again,
doesn't operate own. fact, remember takes place context
events. instance, can likely remember name yet
probably not thinking first learned name. generally
happens very, young children. yet, guessing
probably remember time someone mispronounced name, made fun
name. Or, case me, got 3rd grade two Andrews.
sadly me, lost coin flip allowed keep Andrew. 3rd
grade 12th grade people called Andy. really not prefer.
call Andy comments, delete comment. Just kidding, doesn't bother
much. eventually reclaimed Andrew name. Well, mine
begin throughout, started going Andrew again. say this? Well,
whole context name me. may not whole context
name you. presumably, asked parents named
given name, get context, etc. context reflects activation neural
circuits also related events life. Not just name, probably
siblings names parents are. on, on, on. so, way
memory works individual thing remember want
remember linked something either close, medium, distant
association. turns immensely important. know many will read
will encounter programs designed help enhance memory. know,


phenoms can remember 50 names room full people.
can remember bunch names novel objects maybe even different languages,
often times done association. people will come little mental
tricks either link sound word meaning word way
meaningful will enhance memory. can done impressive
see can that, congratulations. us can't
that, least requires lot effort training. However, things
can leverage natural biology nervous system enhance

00:13:46 Tool: Repetition, Improving Learning & Memory

learning memory particular perceptions, particular information. first just
talk basic ways learn remember things improve
learning memory. basic one repetition. Now study memory
role repetition actually dates back late 1800s, early 1900s
Ebbinghaus developed first so-called learning curves. Now learning curves
simply results quantify many repetitions something required
order remember something. fact, said Ebbinghaus liberated
understanding learning philosophers generating learning curves.
mean that? Well, Ebbinghaus came along, learning memory
thought philosophical ideas. Ebbinghaus came along said, well,
actually take measurements. measure well can remember sequence
words sequence numbers just repeat them. Ebbinghaus
take sequence numbers, words page read them.
take separate sheet paper. presume didn't cheat,
write many try keep
sequence. compare original list see
many errors made. over, over, again.
expect, early training learning took lot repetitions get
sequence correct. time, took fewer sequences. referred
difference initial number repetitions perform versus later
number repetitions perform so-called savings. literally thought
brain generate kind currency effort. talked
savings reduction amount effort put forward order


learn information. got learning curve. can imagine
learning curve looked like. sharp peak beginning dropped off
time. course, remembered meaningless information. even
though information might meaningless, experiment
Ebbinghaus demonstrated immensely meaningful. said
repetition can activate particular sequences neurons repeated
activation lays call memory. might seem like big duh,
prior Ebbinghaus, none known. Now, also say Ebbinghaus,
alive, not aware things called neural
circuits. 1906 Golgi Cajal got Nobel prize actually showing
neurons independent cells connected synapses, little gaps
communicate. may aware that, whole notion
neural circuits hadn't really come about. Nevertheless, Ebbinghaus learning
curves really established sheer repetition, just repeating things
sufficient learn. Something no doubt observed
never formally quantified. Now, look result, something
really important lies little bit cryptic, not obvious people. is,
information trying learn wasn't interesting second time
first, probably even less interesting less less interesting
repetition.

00:17:11 Co-Activation intensity Neuron Activation

yet sheer repetition allowed remember. Now sometime later
early mid 1920s, psychologist Canada named Donald Hebb came
called Hebb's postulate. Hebb's postulate, broadly speaking, idea
sequence neurons active time, roughly time,
lead strengthening connections neurons. many,
many decades experimentation later now know postulate true. Neurons
not smart, don't knowledge. every memory
consequence, told before, repeated activation particular chain
neurons. Ebbinghaus showed repetition Donald Hebb
proposed eventually verified experimentation animals humans
encourage co-activation neurons. Meaning neurons fire


roughly time, will strengthen connections. leads bias
probability neurons will active again. Now, vitally important
nowadays hear lot memories consequence new neurons
added brain. every time learn something, new connection
brain forms. Well, sorry break you, simply not case.
time, want emphasize most, not time learn
something existing neurons, not new neurons, existing neurons
strengthen connections co-activation over.
repetition or, important or, strong activation
once. fact, something called one trial learning whereby experience
something will remember thing forever. often associated
negative events, explain minutes. can also associated
positive events. Like first time saw romantic partner. something
happened romantic partner. first time saw child.
positive event, well extremely negative event. again,
repetition, guess label intensity. really mean say
intensity strong activation neurons can lay traces, circuits
far likely active again, not repetition not strong
activation circuits. mind, return original contrarian
question raised before. is, remember anything? Everyday
wake up, neurons brain body active. Different neural circuits
active. yet, remember small fraction things happen day.
yet, retain lot information previous days days
on. lot repetition extremely strong activation given
neural circuit will create new memories. minutes explain
get extremely strong activation particular neural circuits. Repetition pretty
obvious. Repetition repetition. minutes illustrate whole set
experiments whole set tools point can get extra strong
activation given neural circuit relates learning will remember
information, perhaps not just one trial learning,

00:20:50 Different Types Memory

certainly far fewer repetitions required otherwise. go


want preface discussion saying lot different
kinds memory. fact, take voyage neuroscience,
psychology memory find immense number different terms describe
immense number different types memory researchers focus on.
sake today's discussion, really just want focus short term memory, medium
term memory, longterm memory. still debate, always
case scientists, frankly, exact divisions short term, medium,
longterm memory, can broadly define short term memory longterm memory.
can describe couple different types think can relate
everyday life. common form short term memory going focus
called working memory. Working memory ability keep chain numbers
mind period time expectation really isn't remember
numbers next day certainly not next week. good example
phone number. tell ya phone number, 493-2938, well
probably remember it. 493-2938. came back tomorrow asked repeat
chain numbers, likely not. Unless, course, used particular
tool stamp memory mind commit longterm memory. Now
course, day age, people phone numbers programmed
phone don't really remember exact numbers. usually done
contact identity forth. different example probably
familiar security codes. try log unto app website
asks security code sent text messages can
either plug directly cases, remember short sequence
anywhere usually six seven, sometimes eight numbers. ability that,
switch back forth web pages apps plug number
remembering sequence plugging in, texting keying
keyboard, really good example working memory. Longterm memory,
sort going talking lot today ability commit certain
patterns information, either cognitive information motor information. Right,
ability move limbs particular sequence. long periods time.
remember day, week, month, maybe even year several
years later. got short term memory longterm memory. got
working memory sort keeping something online discarding okay. Not
online computer, online within brain. also two major categories


memory like know about. One explicit memory. not
necessarily explicit sort used thinking about. rather fact
can declare know something. explicit memory name.
Presumably explicit memory house apartment grew
in. know something know know it. can declare it. can
ask you, color first car owned? color
romantic partner's hair? sorts things. explicit declarative memory.
also explicit procedural memories. Now procedural memories, name
suggests, involve action sequences. simplest one, almost ridiculously simple,
walking. say, walk one room other? probably say,
well, go direction turn left. say, no, no, no. exactly
it? say, well, move left foot, right foot, left foot.
describe that. explicit procedural memory. much going
teach young toddler walk, probably say okay, good, good, try.
Okay, know, probably going pre-language toddler.
going encourage move one leg other. going encourage
reward moving one leg other. explicit
procedural memory walk. Okay, almost ridiculously simple. Maybe even truly
ridiculously simple, nonetheless, think context neural
circuits neural firing, pretty amazing. Even amazing fact explicit
memories, declarative procedural explicit memories can moved explicit
implicit. mean that? Well, example walking might
chuckled little bit kind shook head said, ridiculous thing ask.
walk one room next? just walk. just it. Ah, well, just
it? is, implicit understanding. Meaning nervous system
knows walk without actually think

00:25:40 Memory Formation Brain, Hippocampus

know walk. just get chair get
bed walk. brain structure. fact, one side
brain. called hippocampus. hippocampus literally means seahorse.
Anatomists like name brain structures things think brain
structures resemble. look hippocampus, frankly, doesn't look like


seahorse. either reflects lack understanding seahorse really looks
like, visual deficit, think fair say anatomists using little bit
creative elaboration thinking hippocampus looks like. Nonetheless,
curved structure. many layers. described colleague Robert
Sapolsky others looking like jelly roll cinnamon roll, looks
like me. take one cinnamon roll, chop middle. now
got two half cinnamon rolls rather put back together
configuration before, just slide one got essentially two
C's. Two C-shaped halves cinnamon roll push together, right,
slightly off set one another. Well, hippocampus looks like me.
think far better description actual physical structure. guess
use physical structure name, well open brain
atlas called two half-C cinnamon rolls stuffed halfway together.
not good. guess, seahorse will work. Hippocampus name
structure site brain, again, one side
brain, explicit declarative memories formed. not memories
stored maintained. established first place. contrast,
implicit memories, subconscious memories, formed stored elsewhere
brain. Mainly areas like cerebellum, also neocortex, kind outer shell
brain. cerebellum literally means mini-brain. fact look like
mini-brain. back brain. neocortex outer part
brain covers stuff. So, hippocampus vitally important

00:28:00 Hippocampus, Role Memory & Learning, Explicit vs. Implicit Memory

establishing new, declarative memories know know
do. Now, order really understand role hippocampus memory,
particular explicit declarative, explicit procedural memory really understand
distinct implicit declarative implicit procedural memories
look clinical case. clinical case referring patient went
name HM. Patient's go initials order maintain confidentiality real
identity. HM called intractable epilepsy. really
dramatic, so-called grand mal seizures, drop seizures. know
somebody epilepsy, epilepsy, might familiar this. can


petite mal seizures, minor seizures. can tonic clonic seizures,
sometimes not even detectable. can absent seizures people
will just stop, almost brain kind goes pause just stop there.
reported actually Einstein absent seizures. Although don't know
ever really confirmed neurologically. Grand mal seizures extremely severe
HM had. just going day maybe even cooking,
something, driving, operating kind machinery, sudden
just drop seizure. just physically drop go grand
mal seizure. convulsing whole body, loss consciousness, etc.
feel coming on. Often times people epilepsy can feel epileptic seizure coming
on. Kind like wave back brain. sometimes can get safe
circumstance, not always. frequency intensity seizures
robust neurosurgeons neurologists decided needed
locate origin, call foci seizures, remove brain tissue.
way seizures work spread focus, foci brain
tissue. unfortunately HM, focus seizures hippocampus.
lot deliberation, neurosurgeon, fact one famous neurosurgeons
world time, made called electrolytic lesions, actually burned
hippocampus brain HM. consequence, lost explicit memory.
Now consequence couldn't exist normal, everyday life, like
people. live mostly, not entirely, mostly kind hospital
setting. talked several people, say, met HM directly,
no longer alive. interaction might look like following.
walk just fine. wouldn't know kind brain damage.
walk fine, speak fine. say, hi, Andrew. say, hi,
whatever name happened be. wouldn't say HM, probably say
real name. perhaps someone new walk room. might turn
around, look person, us might do. turn around back
say, hi, name? say, well, just told name.
just told name, remember that? say, sorry, don't
remember that. name? go again.
complete lack explicit declarative memory. Now memory
previous events life dated way back, okay. Again, hinting idea
memories not necessarily stored hippocampus, just formed


hippocampus. moved hippocampus brain areas,
still keep memories. different database, will.
different pattern firing

00:31:49 Emotion & Memory Enhancement

neural circuits. couldn't form new memories. Now
important interesting twists HM not terms learning
memory teach us lot brain. fact, think neuroscientists
agree unfortunate case HM's epilepsy subsequent neuro
surgery taught us much know, least think about, terms
human learning memory. instance, mentioned before, still implicit
knowledge. knew walk. knew certain things like make cup
coffee. knew names people met much earlier life, on.
yet couldn't form new memories. Now, violation last statement,
elements HM's emotionality suggests sort
residual capacity learn new information wasn't normally think
explicit declarative procedural memory. instance, reported
said, say, don't know studies ever done intense
physiological measurements, tell HM joke, thought
funny, laugh really hard. liked jokes, say hey, HM, want tell
joke. tell joke laugh really hard. leave
room, come back, tell joke again. Now keep mind, not
remember told joke previously. second time laugh
little bit less. leave room, come back again. Say hi, Andrew.
say, oh, nice meet you. know, recall, can
recall things. couldn't recall things. didn't know just met you.
least couldn't remember it. tell joke third time, fourth time,
subsequent telling joke found little less funny. Just as, keep
mind, folks, tell joke get big laugh, don't tell again. least not
immediately. Not person crowd second time
little less funny third time little less funny. actually
whole element dopamine relationship surprise. topic
future podcast talk humor novelty brain. point


certain forms memory seem exist kind phantom like way within
HM's brain. mean that? Well, underscores implicit
memory heard joke before. suggests humor, least
find funny, somehow related procedures. Similar walking motor ability
precise content joke. right, little bit abstract
concept, point HM lacked explicit declarative memory. couldn't tell
just heard. not learn new information. couldn't tell
something unless learned something many years prior. Now,
lot patients besides HM brain lesions due
epilepsy, say due surgeries treat epilepsy, due strokes, due sadly
gunshot wounds forms call infarcts, infarct. I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct
word use describe damage particular brain region. many different
patients many different patterns infarct taught us lot memory
aspects brain work. HM really teaches us know
able consequence things aware learnings
passed off subconscious knowledge, body knows. brain
knows, don't know exactly know thing. tell story
HM's ability understand joke, repeated telling joke less
less less impact creating sense laughter, humor HM. Not just
anecdote flesh story, emotion turns way
can enhance memories even memories things not
funny, not intensely sad, not immensely happy don't evoke really strong
emotional response, even emotional response. reason
emotions, just like perception, just like sensation, consequence particular
neuro chemicals present brain body. going tell next,
particular neuro chemicals can leverage order learn specific

behavior quickly. that? Well, order answer
look beautiful work James McGaugh Larry Cahill. James McGaugh
Larry Cahill number experiments several decades really based lot
animal literature, mainly focused humans really established required
get better remembering things quickly. want talk one
experiment particularly important. will provide link
paper, years old now, results still hold up. fact, results
established entire field memory neuroscience psychology.
human subjects come laboratory read short paragraph
12 sentences. key thing subjects read paragraph
pretty mundane. content, information within paragraph related
content previous sentence. cogent paragraph. Right, just wasn't
meaningless scramble words. described kind mundane set
circumstances. Maybe story someone walked room, sat
desk, wrote little bit, got lunch. know, just kind
mundane information. Not interesting. Another group subjects read also 12
sentence paragraph. paragraph included subset sentences lot


emotionally intense language. language evoke emotionally
intense response person reading it. might talked car accident
intense surgery. also positive stuff. Things like birthday party,
celebration kind. big sports win. words, two
conditions study. People either read boring paragraph, read really
emotionally laden paragraph. again, emotions either positive
negative emotions. Subjects left laboratory sometime later called back
laboratory say, no point experiment know
part memory experiment. Okay, don't even know reading
paragraph. came either class credit get paid. typically
things done college campuses elsewhere. come back lab
get pop quiz. asked recall content paragraph
read previously. Now probably expected, perhaps even obvious
you, subjects read emotionally intense paragraph remembered far
content paragraph far accurate remembering
information. Now, particular finding wasn't novel. Many people previously
described emotionally intense events better remembered non-emotionally
intense events. fact, way back 1600s Francis Bacon, largely credited
developing scientific method, said, quote, memory assisted anything
makes impression powerful passion. Inspiring fear, example, wonder,
shame, joy.

00:41:42 Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline

Francis Bacon said 1620. Jim McGaugh Larry Cahill certainly not
first demonstrate conceive idea emotionally laden experiences
easily remembered experiences. However, next
immensely important understanding memory building tools
enhance learning memory. evaluated capacity stress
particular neuro chemicals associated stress improve ability learn
information. Not just information emotional, information kinds.
going describe experiments done animal models just briefly,
experiments done humans subjects. McGaugh worked mainly animals,
also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively human subjects. take


rat mouse put arena one location animal receives
electrical shock come back next day, remove shock evoking
device let animal move around arena, animal will, quite
understandably, avoid location shocked. called conditioned place
aversion. affect avoiding particular location occurs one trial. good
example one trial learning. somehow animal knows shocked
location, remembers that. hippocampal dependent learning. animals lack
hippocampus hippocampus pharmacologically otherwise
incapacitated, will not learn new bit information. animals do,
remember first time every time. Unless, block release
certain chemicals brain body chemicals referring
epinephrine, adrenaline, extent corticosterones. Things like cortisol.
Now know effect getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine,
least particular experimental scenario. researchers exact
experiment, done exact experiment, introduce
pharmacological blocker epinephrine, epinephrine released response
shock, cannot actually bind receptors biological effects,
well animal perfectly happy tread back area received
shock. almost didn't know, assume, didn't remember
received shock location. seems pretty obvious hear it.
Something bad happens location, don't go back location.
condition place avoidance. turns opposite also true. Meaning
something called condition place preference can take animal, put arena,
feed reward one location arena. can give hungry rat
mouse food one particular location, take animal out, come back next day.
No food introduced, will go back location received food.
can variant this. can make arena little bit chilly provide
warmth location. can take male animal. turns male rats
mice will mate point. female animal particular called receptive
phase mating cycle give opportunity mate give location,
go back location wait away. perhaps people go back
bar, seat bar, restaurant wait one time they,
know, things worked them. Whatever context was. Condition place
preference. Condition place preference condition place avoidance depends


release adrenaline, right. not just stress. heightened
emotional state brain body. Okay, really important. not just
stress. can get one trial learning positive events, condition place preference.
can get one trial learning negative events. say positive negative,
putting called valence it. Making value judgment whether not
animal liked didn't like it. presume animal liked didn't like
felt. turns true humans well. know
McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning
episode immediately after? Well, ingest something drinking take
capsule form, period time gets absorbed body.
different substances, caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc absorbed gut
blood stream reach brain trigger affects brain body
different rates. not instantaneous. effects within minutes, others
within tens minutes on. really going depend pharmacology
things also going depend whether not food gut,
else happen circulating blood stream, etc. basic
level can confidently say not one, not dozens, mentioned
before, hundreds studies animals humans point fact triggering
increase adrenaline late learning immediately learning going
beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize
enhance improve memory, data McGaugh Cahill many
laboratories stemmed initial work really point fact ideal
protocol focus thing trying learn intensely. also
things like error rates, etc. Please see episodes learning.
newsletter learn better. can access HubermanLab.com. zero
cost newsletter. can grab PDF. lists things learning
about. Still try get excellent sleep. Again, fundamentally important mental health,
physical health, performance. can now extend performance saying
including learning memory. Nap doesn't interrupt nighttime sleep. Naps
anywhere 10 90 minutes. non-sleep deep rest protocols will enhance learning
memory, can now add that, spiking adrenaline provided can
done safe way, going reduce number repetitions required learn.
done tail end immediately learning about.
compatible protocols mentioned. reason revisiting
stuff sleep non-sleep deep rest think people got impression
need immediately learning today saying contrary.
Immediately learning need go heightened state emotionality
alertness. Now vitally important point not need pharmacology.
don't need caffeine. don't need Alpha GPC. don't need pharmacologic
substance spike adrenaline unless something already doing.
can safely. know can safely. always say, say
again, not physician not prescribing anything. professor, profess
things. need safe you. somebody not used
drinking caffeine suddenly drink four espresso trying learn something,


going severe increase alertness probably even anxiety.
panic attack prone, please don't start taking stimulants order learn things better.
Please safe. don't just say protect me, say protect you.
mention not accustomed taking something, always want first
check doctor, course,

01:04:48 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Deliberate Cold Exposure, Adrenaline

also move gradually, right? Start lowest effective dose. minimal
effective dose. sometimes minimal effective dose zero milligrams, nothing.
say that? Well, already talked results put people's arms
ice bath order evoke adrenaline release. welcome
want. fact, pretty low cost, zero pharmacology. least exogenous
pharmacology way approach whole thing. way evoking
natural epinephrine turns also dopamine release. take cold shower.
ice bath get cold circulating bath. done several episodes
utility cold health performance. can find episodes
HubermanLab.com. Also episode colleague Stanford biology
department, Dr. Craig Heller. Lots protocols, particular episode cold
health performance. describe best use cold shower ice bath
circulating cold bath order evoke epinephrine dopamine release.
point time want protocols after, ideally
immediately learning about. Meaning sitting learn new
information trying learn new physical skill. Now whether not
compatible reasons deliberate cold exposure, whether
not compatible things doing, depends contour
lifestyle, training, academic goals, learning goals, etc.
specific purpose enhance learning memory, want spike adrenaline
afterwards. telling can caffeine. can

can safely. know using forms pharmacology.
long episode ADHD. just really declare stance clearly
not fan, actually opposed people using prescription drugs not
prescribed drugs order enhance alertness. think big addictive


potential. also potential really disrupt one's pharmacology around
dopaminergic system. However, know prescribed things like ritalin,
Adderall modafinil things sort order increase alertness focus.
prescribed things board certified physician,
going decide going take trying learn
trying learn. also take consideration drugs
long acting. shorter acting. time according trying

tolerate safely. can make moderately cold. cold order
invoke adrenaline release? Well, uncomfortably cold cold enough
feel like really want get out, can stay safely. going evoke
adrenaline release. quickens breathing, makes go wide eyed.
increasing adrenaline release. fact, effects going wide eyed quickening
breathing challenges thinking clearly, direct effects
adrenaline brain body. course, ways increase
adrenaline. go hard run. number things
increase adrenaline body. things choose you,
clear, solid grounding research data, can confidently say spiking
adrenaline interacting material, physical cognitive material

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data
epinephrine release, better people remembered material.

language, learning passage words, learning mathematics. whether not
physical learning. want emphasize something physical learning
know number probably drinking cup coffee cup yerba
mate maybe even energy drink taking Alpha GPC something
physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work

moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe

improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes

Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

name. particular chain neurons disrupted, not able

interesting question talked before. is, remember
certain things not others? according just said, go
life, experiencing things time. constantly bombarded
sensory stimuli. sensory stimuli perceive,
perceptions get stamped memories. Today going teach
certain things get stamped memories. going teach

00:11:12 Context & Memory Formation

leverage process order remember information want far better.
Now, even though told memory simply bias likelihood
particular chain neurons will activated particular sequence again,
doesn't operate own. fact, remember takes place context
events. instance, can likely remember name yet
probably not thinking first learned name. generally
happens very, young children. yet, guessing
probably remember time someone mispronounced name, made fun
name. Or, case me, got 3rd grade two Andrews.
sadly me, lost coin flip allowed keep Andrew. 3rd
grade 12th grade people called Andy. really not prefer.
call Andy comments, delete comment. Just kidding, doesn't bother
much. eventually reclaimed Andrew name. Well, mine
begin throughout, started going Andrew again. say this? Well,
whole context name me. may not whole context
name you. presumably, asked parents named
given name, get context, etc. context reflects activation neural
circuits also related events life. Not just name, probably
siblings names parents are. on, on, on. so, way
memory works individual thing remember want
remember linked something either close, medium, distant
association. turns immensely important. know many will read
will encounter programs designed help enhance memory. know,


phenoms can remember 50 names room full people.
can remember bunch names novel objects maybe even different languages,
often times done association. people will come little mental
tricks either link sound word meaning word way
meaningful will enhance memory. can done impressive
see can that, congratulations. us can't
that, least requires lot effort training. However, things
can leverage natural biology nervous system enhance

00:13:46 Tool: Repetition, Improving Learning & Memory

learning memory particular perceptions, particular information. first just
talk basic ways learn remember things improve
learning memory. basic one repetition. Now study memory
role repetition actually dates back late 1800s, early 1900s
Ebbinghaus developed first so-called learning curves. Now learning curves
simply results quantify many repetitions something required
order remember something. fact, said Ebbinghaus liberated
understanding learning philosophers generating learning curves.
mean that? Well, Ebbinghaus came along, learning memory
thought philosophical ideas. Ebbinghaus came along said, well,
actually take measurements. measure well can remember sequence
words sequence numbers just repeat them. Ebbinghaus
take sequence numbers, words page read them.
take separate sheet paper. presume didn't cheat,
write many try keep
sequence. compare original list see
many errors made. over, over, again.
expect, early training learning took lot repetitions get
sequence correct. time, took fewer sequences. referred
difference initial number repetitions perform versus later
number repetitions perform so-called savings. literally thought
brain generate kind currency effort. talked
savings reduction amount effort put forward order


learn information. got learning curve. can imagine
learning curve looked like. sharp peak beginning dropped off
time. course, remembered meaningless information. even
though information might meaningless, experiment
Ebbinghaus demonstrated immensely meaningful. said
repetition can activate particular sequences neurons repeated
activation lays call memory. might seem like big duh,
prior Ebbinghaus, none known. Now, also say Ebbinghaus,
alive, not aware things called neural
circuits. 1906 Golgi Cajal got Nobel prize actually showing
neurons independent cells connected synapses, little gaps
communicate. may aware that, whole notion
neural circuits hadn't really come about. Nevertheless, Ebbinghaus learning
curves really established sheer repetition, just repeating things
sufficient learn. Something no doubt observed
never formally quantified. Now, look result, something
really important lies little bit cryptic, not obvious people. is,
information trying learn wasn't interesting second time
first, probably even less interesting less less interesting
repetition.

00:17:11 Co-Activation intensity Neuron Activation

yet sheer repetition allowed remember. Now sometime later
early mid 1920s, psychologist Canada named Donald Hebb came
called Hebb's postulate. Hebb's postulate, broadly speaking, idea
sequence neurons active time, roughly time,
lead strengthening connections neurons. many,
many decades experimentation later now know postulate true. Neurons
not smart, don't knowledge. every memory
consequence, told before, repeated activation particular chain
neurons. Ebbinghaus showed repetition Donald Hebb
proposed eventually verified experimentation animals humans
encourage co-activation neurons. Meaning neurons fire


roughly time, will strengthen connections. leads bias
probability neurons will active again. Now, vitally important
nowadays hear lot memories consequence new neurons
added brain. every time learn something, new connection
brain forms. Well, sorry break you, simply not case.
time, want emphasize most, not time learn
something existing neurons, not new neurons, existing neurons
strengthen connections co-activation over.
repetition or, important or, strong activation
once. fact, something called one trial learning whereby experience
something will remember thing forever. often associated
negative events, explain minutes. can also associated
positive events. Like first time saw romantic partner. something
happened romantic partner. first time saw child.
positive event, well extremely negative event. again,
repetition, guess label intensity. really mean say
intensity strong activation neurons can lay traces, circuits
far likely active again, not repetition not strong
activation circuits. mind, return original contrarian
question raised before. is, remember anything? Everyday
wake up, neurons brain body active. Different neural circuits
active. yet, remember small fraction things happen day.
yet, retain lot information previous days days
on. lot repetition extremely strong activation given
neural circuit will create new memories. minutes explain
get extremely strong activation particular neural circuits. Repetition pretty
obvious. Repetition repetition. minutes illustrate whole set
experiments whole set tools point can get extra strong
activation given neural circuit relates learning will remember
information, perhaps not just one trial learning,

00:20:50 Different Types Memory

certainly far fewer repetitions required otherwise. go


want preface discussion saying lot different
kinds memory. fact, take voyage neuroscience,
psychology memory find immense number different terms describe
immense number different types memory researchers focus on.
sake today's discussion, really just want focus short term memory, medium
term memory, longterm memory. still debate, always
case scientists, frankly, exact divisions short term, medium,
longterm memory, can broadly define short term memory longterm memory.
can describe couple different types think can relate
everyday life. common form short term memory going focus
called working memory. Working memory ability keep chain numbers
mind period time expectation really isn't remember
numbers next day certainly not next week. good example
phone number. tell ya phone number, 493-2938, well
probably remember it. 493-2938. came back tomorrow asked repeat
chain numbers, likely not. Unless, course, used particular
tool stamp memory mind commit longterm memory. Now
course, day age, people phone numbers programmed
phone don't really remember exact numbers. usually done
contact identity forth. different example probably
familiar security codes. try log unto app website
asks security code sent text messages can
either plug directly cases, remember short sequence
anywhere usually six seven, sometimes eight numbers. ability that,
switch back forth web pages apps plug number
remembering sequence plugging in, texting keying
keyboard, really good example working memory. Longterm memory,
sort going talking lot today ability commit certain
patterns information, either cognitive information motor information. Right,
ability move limbs particular sequence. long periods time.
remember day, week, month, maybe even year several
years later. got short term memory longterm memory. got
working memory sort keeping something online discarding okay. Not
online computer, online within brain. also two major categories


memory like know about. One explicit memory. not
necessarily explicit sort used thinking about. rather fact
can declare know something. explicit memory name.
Presumably explicit memory house apartment grew
in. know something know know it. can declare it. can
ask you, color first car owned? color
romantic partner's hair? sorts things. explicit declarative memory.
also explicit procedural memories. Now procedural memories, name
suggests, involve action sequences. simplest one, almost ridiculously simple,
walking. say, walk one room other? probably say,
well, go direction turn left. say, no, no, no. exactly
it? say, well, move left foot, right foot, left foot.
describe that. explicit procedural memory. much going
teach young toddler walk, probably say okay, good, good, try.
Okay, know, probably going pre-language toddler.
going encourage move one leg other. going encourage
reward moving one leg other. explicit
procedural memory walk. Okay, almost ridiculously simple. Maybe even truly
ridiculously simple, nonetheless, think context neural
circuits neural firing, pretty amazing. Even amazing fact explicit
memories, declarative procedural explicit memories can moved explicit
implicit. mean that? Well, example walking might
chuckled little bit kind shook head said, ridiculous thing ask.
walk one room next? just walk. just it. Ah, well, just
it? is, implicit understanding. Meaning nervous system
knows walk without actually think

00:25:40 Memory Formation Brain, Hippocampus

know walk. just get chair get
bed walk. brain structure. fact, one side
brain. called hippocampus. hippocampus literally means seahorse.
Anatomists like name brain structures things think brain
structures resemble. look hippocampus, frankly, doesn't look like


seahorse. either reflects lack understanding seahorse really looks
like, visual deficit, think fair say anatomists using little bit
creative elaboration thinking hippocampus looks like. Nonetheless,
curved structure. many layers. described colleague Robert
Sapolsky others looking like jelly roll cinnamon roll, looks
like me. take one cinnamon roll, chop middle. now
got two half cinnamon rolls rather put back together
configuration before, just slide one got essentially two
C's. Two C-shaped halves cinnamon roll push together, right,
slightly off set one another. Well, hippocampus looks like me.
think far better description actual physical structure. guess
use physical structure name, well open brain
atlas called two half-C cinnamon rolls stuffed halfway together.
not good. guess, seahorse will work. Hippocampus name
structure site brain, again, one side
brain, explicit declarative memories formed. not memories
stored maintained. established first place. contrast,
implicit memories, subconscious memories, formed stored elsewhere
brain. Mainly areas like cerebellum, also neocortex, kind outer shell
brain. cerebellum literally means mini-brain. fact look like
mini-brain. back brain. neocortex outer part
brain covers stuff. So, hippocampus vitally important

00:28:00 Hippocampus, Role Memory & Learning, Explicit vs. Implicit Memory

establishing new, declarative memories know know
do. Now, order really understand role hippocampus memory,
particular explicit declarative, explicit procedural memory really understand
distinct implicit declarative implicit procedural memories
look clinical case. clinical case referring patient went
name HM. Patient's go initials order maintain confidentiality real
identity. HM called intractable epilepsy. really
dramatic, so-called grand mal seizures, drop seizures. know
somebody epilepsy, epilepsy, might familiar this. can


petite mal seizures, minor seizures. can tonic clonic seizures,
sometimes not even detectable. can absent seizures people
will just stop, almost brain kind goes pause just stop there.
reported actually Einstein absent seizures. Although don't know
ever really confirmed neurologically. Grand mal seizures extremely severe
HM had. just going day maybe even cooking,
something, driving, operating kind machinery, sudden
just drop seizure. just physically drop go grand
mal seizure. convulsing whole body, loss consciousness, etc.
feel coming on. Often times people epilepsy can feel epileptic seizure coming
on. Kind like wave back brain. sometimes can get safe
circumstance, not always. frequency intensity seizures
robust neurosurgeons neurologists decided needed
locate origin, call foci seizures, remove brain tissue.
way seizures work spread focus, foci brain
tissue. unfortunately HM, focus seizures hippocampus.
lot deliberation, neurosurgeon, fact one famous neurosurgeons
world time, made called electrolytic lesions, actually burned
hippocampus brain HM. consequence, lost explicit memory.
Now consequence couldn't exist normal, everyday life, like
people. live mostly, not entirely, mostly kind hospital
setting. talked several people, say, met HM directly,
no longer alive. interaction might look like following.
walk just fine. wouldn't know kind brain damage.
walk fine, speak fine. say, hi, Andrew. say, hi,
whatever name happened be. wouldn't say HM, probably say
real name. perhaps someone new walk room. might turn
around, look person, us might do. turn around back
say, hi, name? say, well, just told name.
just told name, remember that? say, sorry, don't
remember that. name? go again.
complete lack explicit declarative memory. Now memory
previous events life dated way back, okay. Again, hinting idea
memories not necessarily stored hippocampus, just formed


hippocampus. moved hippocampus brain areas,
still keep memories. different database, will.
different pattern firing

00:31:49 Emotion & Memory Enhancement

neural circuits. couldn't form new memories. Now
important interesting twists HM not terms learning
memory teach us lot brain. fact, think neuroscientists
agree unfortunate case HM's epilepsy subsequent neuro
surgery taught us much know, least think about, terms
human learning memory. instance, mentioned before, still implicit
knowledge. knew walk. knew certain things like make cup
coffee. knew names people met much earlier life, on.
yet couldn't form new memories. Now, violation last statement,
elements HM's emotionality suggests sort
residual capacity learn new information wasn't normally think
explicit declarative procedural memory. instance, reported
said, say, don't know studies ever done intense
physiological measurements, tell HM joke, thought
funny, laugh really hard. liked jokes, say hey, HM, want tell
joke. tell joke laugh really hard. leave
room, come back, tell joke again. Now keep mind, not
remember told joke previously. second time laugh
little bit less. leave room, come back again. Say hi, Andrew.
say, oh, nice meet you. know, recall, can
recall things. couldn't recall things. didn't know just met you.
least couldn't remember it. tell joke third time, fourth time,
subsequent telling joke found little less funny. Just as, keep
mind, folks, tell joke get big laugh, don't tell again. least not
immediately. Not person crowd second time
little less funny third time little less funny. actually
whole element dopamine relationship surprise. topic
future podcast talk humor novelty brain. point


certain forms memory seem exist kind phantom like way within
HM's brain. mean that? Well, underscores implicit
memory heard joke before. suggests humor, least
find funny, somehow related procedures. Similar walking motor ability
precise content joke. right, little bit abstract
concept, point HM lacked explicit declarative memory. couldn't tell
just heard. not learn new information. couldn't tell
something unless learned something many years prior. Now,
lot patients besides HM brain lesions due
epilepsy, say due surgeries treat epilepsy, due strokes, due sadly
gunshot wounds forms call infarcts, infarct. I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct
word use describe damage particular brain region. many different
patients many different patterns infarct taught us lot memory
aspects brain work. HM really teaches us know
able consequence things aware learnings
passed off subconscious knowledge, body knows. brain
knows, don't know exactly know thing. tell story
HM's ability understand joke, repeated telling joke less
less less impact creating sense laughter, humor HM. Not just
anecdote flesh story, emotion turns way
can enhance memories even memories things not
funny, not intensely sad, not immensely happy don't evoke really strong
emotional response, even emotional response. reason
emotions, just like perception, just like sensation, consequence particular
neuro chemicals present brain body. going tell next,
particular neuro chemicals can leverage order learn specific
information faster remember much longer period time, maybe even
forever. can leveraging relationship nervous system

00:36:44 Tool: Emotion Saliency & Improved Memory

tools enhancing memory. Now one tool absolutely clear works.
always worked, works now, will work forever. repetition.


often perform something recite something, likely
remember future. might seem obvious, worth thinking
happening repeat something. say happening, mean
neural level. happening encouraging firing particular
chains neurons reside particular circuit, right. particular sequence
neurons playing neuron A, B, C, D played particular sequence
again. repetitions, get strengthening nerve
connections. Now, repetition works problem people either don't
patience, don't time, sometimes literally don't
time got deadline something trying remember
learn. simply like able remember things better general
remember quickly. process accelerating repetition based learning
learning curve doesn't go perform something 1,000 times
gradually time 1,000, 750 times day, 500 times day, 300 times day,
no repetitions, right? can just perform thing first time every
time. Well, way shift curve can essentially establish stronger
connections neurons involved generating memory
behavior quickly. that? Well, order answer
look beautiful work James McGaugh Larry Cahill. James McGaugh
Larry Cahill number experiments several decades really based lot
animal literature, mainly focused humans really established required
get better remembering things quickly. want talk one
experiment particularly important. will provide link
paper, years old now, results still hold up. fact, results
established entire field memory neuroscience psychology.
human subjects come laboratory read short paragraph
12 sentences. key thing subjects read paragraph
pretty mundane. content, information within paragraph related
content previous sentence. cogent paragraph. Right, just wasn't
meaningless scramble words. described kind mundane set
circumstances. Maybe story someone walked room, sat
desk, wrote little bit, got lunch. know, just kind
mundane information. Not interesting. Another group subjects read also 12
sentence paragraph. paragraph included subset sentences lot


emotionally intense language. language evoke emotionally
intense response person reading it. might talked car accident
intense surgery. also positive stuff. Things like birthday party,
celebration kind. big sports win. words, two
conditions study. People either read boring paragraph, read really
emotionally laden paragraph. again, emotions either positive
negative emotions. Subjects left laboratory sometime later called back
laboratory say, no point experiment know
part memory experiment. Okay, don't even know reading
paragraph. came either class credit get paid. typically
things done college campuses elsewhere. come back lab
get pop quiz. asked recall content paragraph
read previously. Now probably expected, perhaps even obvious
you, subjects read emotionally intense paragraph remembered far
content paragraph far accurate remembering
information. Now, particular finding wasn't novel. Many people previously
described emotionally intense events better remembered non-emotionally
intense events. fact, way back 1600s Francis Bacon, largely credited
developing scientific method, said, quote, memory assisted anything
makes impression powerful passion. Inspiring fear, example, wonder,
shame, joy.

00:41:42 Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline

Francis Bacon said 1620. Jim McGaugh Larry Cahill certainly not
first demonstrate conceive idea emotionally laden experiences
easily remembered experiences. However, next
immensely important understanding memory building tools
enhance learning memory. evaluated capacity stress
particular neuro chemicals associated stress improve ability learn
information. Not just information emotional, information kinds.
going describe experiments done animal models just briefly,
experiments done humans subjects. McGaugh worked mainly animals,
also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively human subjects. take


rat mouse put arena one location animal receives
electrical shock come back next day, remove shock evoking
device let animal move around arena, animal will, quite
understandably, avoid location shocked. called conditioned place
aversion. affect avoiding particular location occurs one trial. good
example one trial learning. somehow animal knows shocked
location, remembers that. hippocampal dependent learning. animals lack
hippocampus hippocampus pharmacologically otherwise
incapacitated, will not learn new bit information. animals do,
remember first time every time. Unless, block release
certain chemicals brain body chemicals referring
epinephrine, adrenaline, extent corticosterones. Things like cortisol.
Now know effect getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine,
least particular experimental scenario. researchers exact
experiment, done exact experiment, introduce
pharmacological blocker epinephrine, epinephrine released response
shock, cannot actually bind receptors biological effects,
well animal perfectly happy tread back area received
shock. almost didn't know, assume, didn't remember
received shock location. seems pretty obvious hear it.
Something bad happens location, don't go back location.
condition place avoidance. turns opposite also true. Meaning
something called condition place preference can take animal, put arena,
feed reward one location arena. can give hungry rat
mouse food one particular location, take animal out, come back next day.
No food introduced, will go back location received food.
can variant this. can make arena little bit chilly provide
warmth location. can take male animal. turns male rats
mice will mate point. female animal particular called receptive
phase mating cycle give opportunity mate give location,
go back location wait away. perhaps people go back
bar, seat bar, restaurant wait one time they,
know, things worked them. Whatever context was. Condition place
preference. Condition place preference condition place avoidance depends


release adrenaline, right. not just stress. heightened
emotional state brain body. Okay, really important. not just
stress. can get one trial learning positive events, condition place preference.
can get one trial learning negative events. say positive negative,
putting called valence it. Making value judgment whether not
animal liked didn't like it. presume animal liked didn't like
felt. turns true humans well. know
McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning
episode immediately after? Well, ingest something drinking take
capsule form, period time gets absorbed body.
different substances, caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc absorbed gut
blood stream reach brain trigger affects brain body
different rates. not instantaneous. effects within minutes, others
within tens minutes on. really going depend pharmacology
things also going depend whether not food gut,
else happen circulating blood stream, etc. basic
level can confidently say not one, not dozens, mentioned
before, hundreds studies animals humans point fact triggering
increase adrenaline late learning immediately learning going
beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize
enhance improve memory, data McGaugh Cahill many
laboratories stemmed initial work really point fact ideal
protocol focus thing trying learn intensely. also
things like error rates, etc. Please see episodes learning.
newsletter learn better. can access HubermanLab.com. zero
cost newsletter. can grab PDF. lists things learning
about. Still try get excellent sleep. Again, fundamentally important mental health,
physical health, performance. can now extend performance saying
including learning memory. Nap doesn't interrupt nighttime sleep. Naps
anywhere 10 90 minutes. non-sleep deep rest protocols will enhance learning
memory, can now add that, spiking adrenaline provided can
done safe way, going reduce number repetitions required learn.
done tail end immediately learning about.
compatible protocols mentioned. reason revisiting
stuff sleep non-sleep deep rest think people got impression
need immediately learning today saying contrary.
Immediately learning need go heightened state emotionality
alertness. Now vitally important point not need pharmacology.
don't need caffeine. don't need Alpha GPC. don't need pharmacologic
substance spike adrenaline unless something already doing.
can safely. know can safely. always say, say
again, not physician not prescribing anything. professor, profess
things. need safe you. somebody not used
drinking caffeine suddenly drink four espresso trying learn something,


going severe increase alertness probably even anxiety.
panic attack prone, please don't start taking stimulants order learn things better.
Please safe. don't just say protect me, say protect you.
mention not accustomed taking something, always want first
check doctor, course,

01:04:48 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Deliberate Cold Exposure, Adrenaline

also move gradually, right? Start lowest effective dose. minimal
effective dose. sometimes minimal effective dose zero milligrams, nothing.
say that? Well, already talked results put people's arms
ice bath order evoke adrenaline release. welcome
want. fact, pretty low cost, zero pharmacology. least exogenous
pharmacology way approach whole thing. way evoking
natural epinephrine turns also dopamine release. take cold shower.
ice bath get cold circulating bath. done several episodes
utility cold health performance. can find episodes
HubermanLab.com. Also episode colleague Stanford biology
department, Dr. Craig Heller. Lots protocols, particular episode cold
health performance. describe best use cold shower ice bath
circulating cold bath order evoke epinephrine dopamine release.
point time want protocols after, ideally
immediately learning about. Meaning sitting learn new
information trying learn new physical skill. Now whether not
compatible reasons deliberate cold exposure, whether
not compatible things doing, depends contour
lifestyle, training, academic goals, learning goals, etc.
specific purpose enhance learning memory, want spike adrenaline
afterwards. telling can caffeine. can
Alpha GPC. can combination caffeine Alpha GPC.
can safely. know using forms pharmacology.
long episode ADHD. just really declare stance clearly
not fan, actually opposed people using prescription drugs not
prescribed drugs order enhance alertness. think big addictive


potential. also potential really disrupt one's pharmacology around
dopaminergic system. However, know prescribed things like ritalin,
Adderall modafinil things sort order increase alertness focus.
prescribed things board certified physician,
going decide going take trying learn
trying learn. also take consideration drugs
long acting. shorter acting. time according trying
learn when. pharmacology. mentioned, behavioral
protocols. can use cold cold excellent stimulus first all,
doesn't involve pharmacology. Second all, can generally access low zero
cost, especially cold shower approach. third, can titrate it. can start
warmer water. can make very, cold thing able
tolerate safely. can make moderately cold. cold order
invoke adrenaline release? Well, uncomfortably cold cold enough
feel like really want get out, can stay safely. going evoke
adrenaline release. quickens breathing, makes go wide eyed.
increasing adrenaline release. fact, effects going wide eyed quickening
breathing challenges thinking clearly, direct effects
adrenaline brain body. course, ways increase
adrenaline. go hard run. number things
increase adrenaline body. things choose you,
clear, solid grounding research data, can confidently say spiking
adrenaline interacting material, physical cognitive material

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data
epinephrine release, better people remembered material.
shown. Whether not cognitive material, learning
language, learning passage words, learning mathematics. whether not
physical learning. want emphasize something physical learning
know number probably drinking cup coffee cup yerba
mate maybe even energy drink taking Alpha GPC something
physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work
matter, guest. think perfectly fine, provided safe you.
moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular

00:13:46 Tool: Repetition, Improving Learning & Memory

learning memory particular perceptions, particular information. first just
talk basic ways learn remember things improve
learning memory. basic one repetition. Now study memory
role repetition actually dates back late 1800s, early 1900s
Ebbinghaus developed first so-called learning curves. Now learning curves
simply results quantify many repetitions something required
order remember something. fact, said Ebbinghaus liberated
understanding learning philosophers generating learning curves.
mean that? Well, Ebbinghaus came along, learning memory
thought philosophical ideas. Ebbinghaus came along said, well,
actually take measurements. measure well can remember sequence
words sequence numbers just repeat them. Ebbinghaus
take sequence numbers, words page read them.
take separate sheet paper. presume didn't cheat,
write many try keep
sequence. compare original list see
many errors made. over, over, again.
expect, early training learning took lot repetitions get
sequence correct. time, took fewer sequences. referred
difference initial number repetitions perform versus later
number repetitions perform so-called savings. literally thought
brain generate kind currency effort. talked
savings reduction amount effort put forward order


learn information. got learning curve. can imagine
learning curve looked like. sharp peak beginning dropped off
time. course, remembered meaningless information. even
though information might meaningless, experiment
Ebbinghaus demonstrated immensely meaningful. said
repetition can activate particular sequences neurons repeated
activation lays call memory. might seem like big duh,
prior Ebbinghaus, none known. Now, also say Ebbinghaus,
alive, not aware things called neural
circuits. 1906 Golgi Cajal got Nobel prize actually showing
neurons independent cells connected synapses, little gaps
communicate. may aware that, whole notion
neural circuits hadn't really come about. Nevertheless, Ebbinghaus learning
curves really established sheer repetition, just repeating things
sufficient learn. Something no doubt observed
never formally quantified. Now, look result, something
really important lies little bit cryptic, not obvious people. is,
information trying learn wasn't interesting second time
first, probably even less interesting less less interesting
repetition.

00:17:11 Co-Activation intensity Neuron Activation

yet sheer repetition allowed remember. Now sometime later
early mid 1920s, psychologist Canada named Donald Hebb came
called Hebb's postulate. Hebb's postulate, broadly speaking, idea
sequence neurons active time, roughly time,
lead strengthening connections neurons. many,
many decades experimentation later now know postulate true. Neurons
not smart, don't knowledge. every memory
consequence, told before, repeated activation particular chain
neurons. Ebbinghaus showed repetition Donald Hebb
proposed eventually verified experimentation animals humans
encourage co-activation neurons. Meaning neurons fire


roughly time, will strengthen connections. leads bias
probability neurons will active again. Now, vitally important
nowadays hear lot memories consequence new neurons
added brain. every time learn something, new connection
brain forms. Well, sorry break you, simply not case.
time, want emphasize most, not time learn
something existing neurons, not new neurons, existing neurons
strengthen connections co-activation over.
repetition or, important or, strong activation
once. fact, something called one trial learning whereby experience
something will remember thing forever. often associated
negative events, explain minutes. can also associated
positive events. Like first time saw romantic partner. something
happened romantic partner. first time saw child.

00:20:50 Different Types Memory

certainly far fewer repetitions required otherwise. go


want preface discussion saying lot different
kinds memory. fact, take voyage neuroscience,
psychology memory find immense number different terms describe
immense number different types memory researchers focus on.
sake today's discussion, really just want focus short term memory, medium
term memory, longterm memory. still debate, always
case scientists, frankly, exact divisions short term, medium,
longterm memory, can broadly define short term memory longterm memory.
can describe couple different types think can relate
everyday life. common form short term memory going focus
called working memory. Working memory ability keep chain numbers
mind period time expectation really isn't remember
numbers next day certainly not next week. good example
phone number. tell ya phone number, 493-2938, well
probably remember it. 493-2938. came back tomorrow asked repeat
chain numbers, likely not. Unless, course, used particular
tool stamp memory mind commit longterm memory. Now
course, day age, people phone numbers programmed
phone don't really remember exact numbers. usually done
contact identity forth. different example probably
familiar security codes. try log unto app website
asks security code sent text messages can
either plug directly cases, remember short sequence
anywhere usually six seven, sometimes eight numbers. ability that,
switch back forth web pages apps plug number
remembering sequence plugging in, texting keying
keyboard, really good example working memory. Longterm memory,
sort going talking lot today ability commit certain
patterns information, either cognitive information motor information. Right,
ability move limbs particular sequence. long periods time.
remember day, week, month, maybe even year several
years later. got short term memory longterm memory. got
working memory sort keeping something online discarding okay. Not
online computer, online within brain. also two major categories


memory like know about. One explicit memory. not
necessarily explicit sort used thinking about. rather fact
can declare know something. explicit memory name.
Presumably explicit memory house apartment grew
in. know something know know it. can declare it. can
ask you, color first car owned? color
romantic partner's hair? sorts things. explicit declarative memory.
also explicit procedural memories. Now procedural memories, name
suggests, involve action sequences. simplest one, almost ridiculously simple,
walking. say, walk one room other? probably say,
well, go direction turn left. say, no, no, no. exactly
it? say, well, move left foot, right foot, left foot.
describe that. explicit procedural memory. much going
teach young toddler walk, probably say okay, good, good, try.
Okay, know, probably going pre-language toddler.
going encourage move one leg other. going encourage
reward moving one leg other. explicit
procedural memory walk. Okay, almost ridiculously simple. Maybe even truly
ridiculously simple, nonetheless, think context neural
circuits neural firing, pretty amazing. Even amazing fact explicit
memories, declarative procedural explicit memories can moved explicit
implicit. mean that? Well, example walking might
chuckled little bit kind shook head said, ridiculous thing ask.
walk one room next? just walk. just it. Ah, well, just
it? is, implicit understanding. Meaning nervous system
knows walk without actually think

00:25:40 Memory Formation Brain, Hippocampus

know walk. just get chair get
bed walk. brain structure. fact, one side
brain. called hippocampus. hippocampus literally means seahorse.
Anatomists like name brain structures things think brain
structures resemble. look hippocampus, frankly, doesn't look like


seahorse. either reflects lack understanding seahorse really looks
like, visual deficit, think fair say anatomists using little bit
creative elaboration thinking hippocampus looks like. Nonetheless,
curved structure. many layers. described colleague Robert
Sapolsky others looking like jelly roll cinnamon roll, looks
like me. take one cinnamon roll, chop middle. now
got two half cinnamon rolls rather put back together
configuration before, just slide one got essentially two
C's. Two C-shaped halves cinnamon roll push together, right,
slightly off set one another. Well, hippocampus looks like me.
think far better description actual physical structure. guess
use physical structure name, well open brain
atlas called two half-C cinnamon rolls stuffed halfway together.
not good. guess, seahorse will work. Hippocampus name
structure site brain, again, one side
brain, explicit declarative memories formed. not memories
stored maintained. established first place. contrast,
implicit memories, subconscious memories, formed stored elsewhere
brain. Mainly areas like cerebellum, also neocortex, kind outer shell
brain. cerebellum literally means mini-brain. fact look like
mini-brain. back brain. neocortex outer part
brain covers stuff. So, hippocampus vitally important

00:28:00 Hippocampus, Role Memory & Learning, Explicit vs. Implicit Memory

establishing new, declarative memories know know
do. Now, order really understand role hippocampus memory,
particular explicit declarative, explicit procedural memory really understand
distinct implicit declarative implicit procedural memories
look clinical case. clinical case referring patient went
name HM. Patient's go initials order maintain confidentiality real
identity. HM called intractable epilepsy. really
dramatic, so-called grand mal seizures, drop seizures. know
somebody epilepsy, epilepsy, might familiar this. can


petite mal seizures, minor seizures. can tonic clonic seizures,
sometimes not even detectable. can absent seizures people
will just stop, almost brain kind goes pause just stop there.
reported actually Einstein absent seizures. Although don't know
ever really confirmed neurologically. Grand mal seizures extremely severe
HM had. just going day maybe even cooking,
something, driving, operating kind machinery, sudden
just drop seizure. just physically drop go grand
mal seizure. convulsing whole body, loss consciousness, etc.
feel coming on. Often times people epilepsy can feel epileptic seizure coming
on. Kind like wave back brain. sometimes can get safe
circumstance, not always. frequency intensity seizures
robust neurosurgeons neurologists decided needed
locate origin, call foci seizures, remove brain tissue.
way seizures work spread focus, foci brain
tissue. unfortunately HM, focus seizures hippocampus.
lot deliberation, neurosurgeon, fact one famous neurosurgeons
world time, made called electrolytic lesions, actually burned
hippocampus brain HM. consequence, lost explicit memory.
Now consequence couldn't exist normal, everyday life, like
people. live mostly, not entirely, mostly kind hospital
setting. talked several people, say, met HM directly,
no longer alive. interaction might look like following.
walk just fine. wouldn't know kind brain damage.
walk fine, speak fine. say, hi, Andrew. say, hi,
whatever name happened be. wouldn't say HM, probably say
real name. perhaps someone new walk room. might turn
around, look person, us might do. turn around back
say, hi, name? say, well, just told name.
just told name, remember that? say, sorry, don't
remember that. name? go again.
complete lack explicit declarative memory. Now memory
previous events life dated way back, okay. Again, hinting idea
memories not necessarily stored hippocampus, just formed


hippocampus. moved hippocampus brain areas,
still keep memories. different database, will.
different pattern firing

00:31:49 Emotion & Memory Enhancement

neural circuits. couldn't form new memories. Now
important interesting twists HM not terms learning
memory teach us lot brain. fact, think neuroscientists
agree unfortunate case HM's epilepsy subsequent neuro
surgery taught us much know, least think about, terms
human learning memory. instance, mentioned before, still implicit
knowledge. knew walk. knew certain things like make cup
coffee. knew names people met much earlier life, on.
yet couldn't form new memories. Now, violation last statement,
elements HM's emotionality suggests sort
residual capacity learn new information wasn't normally think
explicit declarative procedural memory. instance, reported
said, say, don't know studies ever done intense
physiological measurements, tell HM joke, thought
funny, laugh really hard. liked jokes, say hey, HM, want tell
joke. tell joke laugh really hard. leave
room, come back, tell joke again. Now keep mind, not
remember told joke previously. second time laugh
little bit less. leave room, come back again. Say hi, Andrew.
say, oh, nice meet you. know, recall, can
recall things. couldn't recall things. didn't know just met you.
least couldn't remember it. tell joke third time, fourth time,
subsequent telling joke found little less funny. Just as, keep
mind, folks, tell joke get big laugh, don't tell again. least not
immediately. Not person crowd second time
little less funny third time little less funny. actually
whole element dopamine relationship surprise. topic
future podcast talk humor novelty brain. point


certain forms memory seem exist kind phantom like way within
HM's brain. mean that? Well, underscores implicit
memory heard joke before. suggests humor, least
find funny, somehow related procedures. Similar walking motor ability
precise content joke. right, little bit abstract
concept, point HM lacked explicit declarative memory. couldn't tell
just heard. not learn new information. couldn't tell
something unless learned something many years prior. Now,
lot patients besides HM brain lesions due
epilepsy, say due surgeries treat epilepsy, due strokes, due sadly
gunshot wounds forms call infarcts, infarct. I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct
word use describe damage particular brain region. many different
patients many different patterns infarct taught us lot memory
aspects brain work. HM really teaches us know
able consequence things aware learnings
passed off subconscious knowledge, body knows. brain
knows, don't know exactly know thing. tell story
HM's ability understand joke, repeated telling joke less
less less impact creating sense laughter, humor HM. Not just
anecdote flesh story, emotion turns way
can enhance memories even memories things not
funny, not intensely sad, not immensely happy don't evoke really strong
emotional response, even emotional response. reason
emotions, just like perception, just like sensation, consequence particular
neuro chemicals present brain body. going tell next,
particular neuro chemicals can leverage order learn specific
information faster remember much longer period time, maybe even
forever. can leveraging relationship nervous system

remember quickly. process accelerating repetition based learning
learning curve doesn't go perform something 1,000 times

connections neurons involved generating memory
behavior quickly. that? Well, order answer
look beautiful work James McGaugh Larry Cahill. James McGaugh
Larry Cahill number experiments several decades really based lot
animal literature, mainly focused humans really established required
get better remembering things quickly. want talk one
experiment particularly important. will provide link
paper, years old now, results still hold up. fact, results
established entire field memory neuroscience psychology.
human subjects come laboratory read short paragraph
12 sentences. key thing subjects read paragraph
pretty mundane. content, information within paragraph related
content previous sentence. cogent paragraph. Right, just wasn't
meaningless scramble words. described kind mundane set
circumstances. Maybe story someone walked room, sat
desk, wrote little bit, got lunch. know, just kind
mundane information. Not interesting. Another group subjects read also 12
sentence paragraph. paragraph included subset sentences lot


emotionally intense language. language evoke emotionally
intense response person reading it. might talked car accident
intense surgery. also positive stuff. Things like birthday party,
celebration kind. big sports win. words, two
conditions study. People either read boring paragraph, read really
emotionally laden paragraph. again, emotions either positive
negative emotions. Subjects left laboratory sometime later called back
laboratory say, no point experiment know
part memory experiment. Okay, don't even know reading
paragraph. came either class credit get paid. typically
things done college campuses elsewhere. come back lab
get pop quiz. asked recall content paragraph
read previously. Now probably expected, perhaps even obvious
you, subjects read emotionally intense paragraph remembered far
content paragraph far accurate remembering
information. Now, particular finding wasn't novel. Many people previously
described emotionally intense events better remembered non-emotionally
intense events. fact, way back 1600s Francis Bacon, largely credited
developing scientific method, said, quote, memory assisted anything
makes impression powerful passion. Inspiring fear, example, wonder,
shame, joy.

00:41:42 Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline

Francis Bacon said 1620. Jim McGaugh Larry Cahill certainly not
first demonstrate conceive idea emotionally laden experiences
easily remembered experiences. However, next
immensely important understanding memory building tools
enhance learning memory. evaluated capacity stress
particular neuro chemicals associated stress improve ability learn
information. Not just information emotional, information kinds.
going describe experiments done animal models just briefly,
experiments done humans subjects. McGaugh worked mainly animals,
also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively human subjects. take


rat mouse put arena one location animal receives
electrical shock come back next day, remove shock evoking
device let animal move around arena, animal will, quite
understandably, avoid location shocked. called conditioned place
aversion. affect avoiding particular location occurs one trial. good
example one trial learning. somehow animal knows shocked
location, remembers that. hippocampal dependent learning. animals lack
hippocampus hippocampus pharmacologically otherwise
incapacitated, will not learn new bit information. animals do,
remember first time every time. Unless, block release
certain chemicals brain body chemicals referring
epinephrine, adrenaline, extent corticosterones. Things like cortisol.
Now know effect getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine,
least particular experimental scenario. researchers exact
experiment, done exact experiment, introduce
pharmacological blocker epinephrine, epinephrine released response
shock, cannot actually bind receptors biological effects,
well animal perfectly happy tread back area received
shock. almost didn't know, assume, didn't remember
received shock location. seems pretty obvious hear it.
Something bad happens location, don't go back location.
condition place avoidance. turns opposite also true. Meaning
something called condition place preference can take animal, put arena,
feed reward one location arena. can give hungry rat
mouse food one particular location, take animal out, come back next day.
No food introduced, will go back location received food.
can variant this. can make arena little bit chilly provide
warmth location. can take male animal. turns male rats
mice will mate point. female animal particular called receptive
phase mating cycle give opportunity mate give location,
go back location wait away. perhaps people go back
bar, seat bar, restaurant wait one time they,
know, things worked them. Whatever context was. Condition place
preference. Condition place preference condition place avoidance depends


release adrenaline, right. not just stress. heightened
emotional state brain body. Okay, really important. not just
stress. can get one trial learning positive events, condition place preference.
can get one trial learning negative events. say positive negative,
putting called valence it. Making value judgment whether not
animal liked didn't like it. presume animal liked didn't like
felt. turns true humans well. know
McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning
episode immediately after? Well, ingest something drinking take
capsule form, period time gets absorbed body.
different substances, caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc absorbed gut
blood stream reach brain trigger affects brain body
different rates. not instantaneous. effects within minutes, others
within tens minutes on. really going depend pharmacology
things also going depend whether not food gut,
else happen circulating blood stream, etc. basic
level can confidently say not one, not dozens, mentioned
before, hundreds studies animals humans point fact triggering
increase adrenaline late learning immediately learning going
beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize
enhance improve memory, data McGaugh Cahill many
laboratories stemmed initial work really point fact ideal
protocol focus thing trying learn intensely. also
things like error rates, etc. Please see episodes learning.
newsletter learn better. can access HubermanLab.com. zero
cost newsletter. can grab PDF. lists things learning
about. Still try get excellent sleep. Again, fundamentally important mental health,
physical health, performance. can now extend performance saying
including learning memory. Nap doesn't interrupt nighttime sleep. Naps
anywhere 10 90 minutes. non-sleep deep rest protocols will enhance learning
memory, can now add that, spiking adrenaline provided can
done safe way, going reduce number repetitions required learn.
done tail end immediately learning about.
compatible protocols mentioned. reason revisiting
stuff sleep non-sleep deep rest think people got impression
need immediately learning today saying contrary.
Immediately learning need go heightened state emotionality
alertness. Now vitally important point not need pharmacology.
don't need caffeine. don't need Alpha GPC. don't need pharmacologic
substance spike adrenaline unless something already doing.
can safely. know can safely. always say, say
again, not physician not prescribing anything. professor, profess
things. need safe you. somebody not used
drinking caffeine suddenly drink four espresso trying learn something,


going severe increase alertness probably even anxiety.
panic attack prone, please don't start taking stimulants order learn things better.
Please safe. don't just say protect me, say protect you.
mention not accustomed taking something, always want first
check doctor, course,

01:04:48 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Deliberate Cold Exposure, Adrenaline

also move gradually, right? Start lowest effective dose. minimal
effective dose. sometimes minimal effective dose zero milligrams, nothing.
say that? Well, already talked results put people's arms
ice bath order evoke adrenaline release. welcome
want. fact, pretty low cost, zero pharmacology. least exogenous

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data

scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start
become afraid entire city blocks one bad thing happened particular room
particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise
specific nuanced every little detail. amygdala lumper
splitter comes sensory events. areas brain become
active very, specific conditions conditions. similarly,
epinephrine just molecule. just chemical circulating brain body.
no epinephrine specifically cold shower distinct epinephrine
associated bad event distinct epinephrine associated
really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

neural circuits hadn't really come about. Nevertheless, Ebbinghaus learning
curves really established sheer repetition, just repeating things
sufficient learn. Something no doubt observed
never formally quantified. Now, look result, something
really important lies little bit cryptic, not obvious people. is,
information trying learn wasn't interesting second time
first, probably even less interesting less less interesting
repetition.

00:17:11 Co-Activation intensity Neuron Activation

yet sheer repetition allowed remember. Now sometime later
early mid 1920s, psychologist Canada named Donald Hebb came
called Hebb's postulate. Hebb's postulate, broadly speaking, idea
sequence neurons active time, roughly time,
lead strengthening connections neurons. many,
many decades experimentation later now know postulate true. Neurons
not smart, don't knowledge. every memory
consequence, told before, repeated activation particular chain
neurons. Ebbinghaus showed repetition Donald Hebb
proposed eventually verified experimentation animals humans
encourage co-activation neurons. Meaning neurons fire


roughly time, will strengthen connections. leads bias
probability neurons will active again. Now, vitally important
nowadays hear lot memories consequence new neurons
added brain. every time learn something, new connection
brain forms. Well, sorry break you, simply not case.
time, want emphasize most, not time learn
something existing neurons, not new neurons, existing neurons
strengthen connections co-activation over.
repetition or, important or, strong activation
once. fact, something called one trial learning whereby experience
something will remember thing forever. often associated
negative events, explain minutes. can also associated
positive events. Like first time saw romantic partner. something
happened romantic partner. first time saw child.
positive event, well extremely negative event. again,
repetition, guess label intensity. really mean say
intensity strong activation neurons can lay traces, circuits
far likely active again, not repetition not strong
activation circuits. mind, return original contrarian
question raised before. is, remember anything? Everyday
wake up, neurons brain body active. Different neural circuits
active. yet, remember small fraction things happen day.
yet, retain lot information previous days days
on. lot repetition extremely strong activation given
neural circuit will create new memories. minutes explain
get extremely strong activation particular neural circuits. Repetition pretty
obvious. Repetition repetition. minutes illustrate whole set
experiments whole set tools point can get extra strong
activation given neural circuit relates learning will remember
information, perhaps not just one trial learning,

00:20:50 Different Types Memory

certainly far fewer repetitions required otherwise. go


want preface discussion saying lot different
kinds memory. fact, take voyage neuroscience,
psychology memory find immense number different terms describe
immense number different types memory researchers focus on.
sake today's discussion, really just want focus short term memory, medium
term memory, longterm memory. still debate, always
case scientists, frankly, exact divisions short term, medium,
longterm memory, can broadly define short term memory longterm memory.
can describe couple different types think can relate
everyday life. common form short term memory going focus
called working memory. Working memory ability keep chain numbers
mind period time expectation really isn't remember
numbers next day certainly not next week. good example
phone number. tell ya phone number, 493-2938, well
probably remember it. 493-2938. came back tomorrow asked repeat
chain numbers, likely not. Unless, course, used particular
tool stamp memory mind commit longterm memory. Now
course, day age, people phone numbers programmed
phone don't really remember exact numbers. usually done
contact identity forth. different example probably
familiar security codes. try log unto app website
asks security code sent text messages can
either plug directly cases, remember short sequence
anywhere usually six seven, sometimes eight numbers. ability that,
switch back forth web pages apps plug number
remembering sequence plugging in, texting keying
keyboard, really good example working memory. Longterm memory,
sort going talking lot today ability commit certain
patterns information, either cognitive information motor information. Right,
ability move limbs particular sequence. long periods time.
remember day, week, month, maybe even year several
years later. got short term memory longterm memory. got
working memory sort keeping something online discarding okay. Not
online computer, online within brain. also two major categories


memory like know about. One explicit memory. not
necessarily explicit sort used thinking about. rather fact
can declare know something. explicit memory name.
Presumably explicit memory house apartment grew
in. know something know know it. can declare it. can
ask you, color first car owned? color
romantic partner's hair? sorts things. explicit declarative memory.
also explicit procedural memories. Now procedural memories, name
suggests, involve action sequences. simplest one, almost ridiculously simple,
walking. say, walk one room other? probably say,
well, go direction turn left. say, no, no, no. exactly
it? say, well, move left foot, right foot, left foot.
describe that. explicit procedural memory. much going
teach young toddler walk, probably say okay, good, good, try.
Okay, know, probably going pre-language toddler.
going encourage move one leg other. going encourage
reward moving one leg other. explicit
procedural memory walk. Okay, almost ridiculously simple. Maybe even truly
ridiculously simple, nonetheless, think context neural
circuits neural firing, pretty amazing. Even amazing fact explicit
memories, declarative procedural explicit memories can moved explicit
implicit. mean that? Well, example walking might
chuckled little bit kind shook head said, ridiculous thing ask.
walk one room next? just walk. just it. Ah, well, just
it? is, implicit understanding. Meaning nervous system
knows walk without actually think

00:25:40 Memory Formation Brain, Hippocampus

know walk. just get chair get
bed walk. brain structure. fact, one side
brain. called hippocampus. hippocampus literally means seahorse.
Anatomists like name brain structures things think brain
structures resemble. look hippocampus, frankly, doesn't look like


seahorse. either reflects lack understanding seahorse really looks
like, visual deficit, think fair say anatomists using little bit
creative elaboration thinking hippocampus looks like. Nonetheless,
curved structure. many layers. described colleague Robert
Sapolsky others looking like jelly roll cinnamon roll, looks
like me. take one cinnamon roll, chop middle. now
got two half cinnamon rolls rather put back together
configuration before, just slide one got essentially two
C's. Two C-shaped halves cinnamon roll push together, right,
slightly off set one another. Well, hippocampus looks like me.
think far better description actual physical structure. guess
use physical structure name, well open brain
atlas called two half-C cinnamon rolls stuffed halfway together.
not good. guess, seahorse will work. Hippocampus name
structure site brain, again, one side
brain, explicit declarative memories formed. not memories
stored maintained. established first place. contrast,
implicit memories, subconscious memories, formed stored elsewhere
brain. Mainly areas like cerebellum, also neocortex, kind outer shell
brain. cerebellum literally means mini-brain. fact look like
mini-brain. back brain. neocortex outer part
brain covers stuff. So, hippocampus vitally important

00:28:00 Hippocampus, Role Memory & Learning, Explicit vs. Implicit Memory

establishing new, declarative memories know know
do. Now, order really understand role hippocampus memory,
particular explicit declarative, explicit procedural memory really understand
distinct implicit declarative implicit procedural memories
look clinical case. clinical case referring patient went
name HM. Patient's go initials order maintain confidentiality real
identity. HM called intractable epilepsy. really
dramatic, so-called grand mal seizures, drop seizures. know
somebody epilepsy, epilepsy, might familiar this. can


petite mal seizures, minor seizures. can tonic clonic seizures,
sometimes not even detectable. can absent seizures people
will just stop, almost brain kind goes pause just stop there.
reported actually Einstein absent seizures. Although don't know
ever really confirmed neurologically. Grand mal seizures extremely severe
HM had. just going day maybe even cooking,
something, driving, operating kind machinery, sudden
just drop seizure. just physically drop go grand
mal seizure. convulsing whole body, loss consciousness, etc.
feel coming on. Often times people epilepsy can feel epileptic seizure coming
on. Kind like wave back brain. sometimes can get safe
circumstance, not always. frequency intensity seizures
robust neurosurgeons neurologists decided needed
locate origin, call foci seizures, remove brain tissue.
way seizures work spread focus, foci brain
tissue. unfortunately HM, focus seizures hippocampus.
lot deliberation, neurosurgeon, fact one famous neurosurgeons
world time, made called electrolytic lesions, actually burned
hippocampus brain HM. consequence, lost explicit memory.
Now consequence couldn't exist normal, everyday life, like
people. live mostly, not entirely, mostly kind hospital
setting. talked several people, say, met HM directly,
no longer alive. interaction might look like following.
walk just fine. wouldn't know kind brain damage.
walk fine, speak fine. say, hi, Andrew. say, hi,
whatever name happened be. wouldn't say HM, probably say
real name. perhaps someone new walk room. might turn
around, look person, us might do. turn around back
say, hi, name? say, well, just told name.
just told name, remember that? say, sorry, don't
remember that. name? go again.
complete lack explicit declarative memory. Now memory
previous events life dated way back, okay. Again, hinting idea
memories not necessarily stored hippocampus, just formed


hippocampus. moved hippocampus brain areas,
still keep memories. different database, will.
different pattern firing

00:31:49 Emotion & Memory Enhancement

neural circuits. couldn't form new memories. Now
important interesting twists HM not terms learning
memory teach us lot brain. fact, think neuroscientists
agree unfortunate case HM's epilepsy subsequent neuro
surgery taught us much know, least think about, terms
human learning memory. instance, mentioned before, still implicit
knowledge. knew walk. knew certain things like make cup
coffee. knew names people met much earlier life, on.
yet couldn't form new memories. Now, violation last statement,
elements HM's emotionality suggests sort
residual capacity learn new information wasn't normally think
explicit declarative procedural memory. instance, reported
said, say, don't know studies ever done intense
physiological measurements, tell HM joke, thought
funny, laugh really hard. liked jokes, say hey, HM, want tell
joke. tell joke laugh really hard. leave
room, come back, tell joke again. Now keep mind, not
remember told joke previously. second time laugh
little bit less. leave room, come back again. Say hi, Andrew.
say, oh, nice meet you. know, recall, can
recall things. couldn't recall things. didn't know just met you.
least couldn't remember it. tell joke third time, fourth time,
subsequent telling joke found little less funny. Just as, keep
mind, folks, tell joke get big laugh, don't tell again. least not
immediately. Not person crowd second time
little less funny third time little less funny. actually
whole element dopamine relationship surprise. topic
future podcast talk humor novelty brain. point


certain forms memory seem exist kind phantom like way within
HM's brain. mean that? Well, underscores implicit
memory heard joke before. suggests humor, least
find funny, somehow related procedures. Similar walking motor ability
precise content joke. right, little bit abstract
concept, point HM lacked explicit declarative memory. couldn't tell
just heard. not learn new information. couldn't tell
something unless learned something many years prior. Now,
lot patients besides HM brain lesions due
epilepsy, say due surgeries treat epilepsy, due strokes, due sadly
gunshot wounds forms call infarcts, infarct. I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct
word use describe damage particular brain region. many different
patients many different patterns infarct taught us lot memory
aspects brain work. HM really teaches us know
able consequence things aware learnings
passed off subconscious knowledge, body knows. brain
knows, don't know exactly know thing. tell story
HM's ability understand joke, repeated telling joke less
less less impact creating sense laughter, humor HM. Not just
anecdote flesh story, emotion turns way
can enhance memories even memories things not
funny, not intensely sad, not immensely happy don't evoke really strong
emotional response, even emotional response. reason
emotions, just like perception, just like sensation, consequence particular
neuro chemicals present brain body. going tell next,
particular neuro chemicals can leverage order learn specific
information faster remember much longer period time, maybe even
forever. can leveraging relationship nervous system

tools enhancing memory. Now one tool absolutely clear works.
always worked, works now, will work forever. repetition.


often perform something recite something, likely
remember future. might seem obvious, worth thinking
happening repeat something. say happening, mean
neural level. happening encouraging firing particular
chains neurons reside particular circuit, right. particular sequence
neurons playing neuron A, B, C, D played particular sequence
again. repetitions, get strengthening nerve
connections. Now, repetition works problem people either don't
patience, don't time, sometimes literally don't

remember quickly. process accelerating repetition based learning
learning curve doesn't go perform something 1,000 times
gradually time 1,000, 750 times day, 500 times day, 300 times day,
no repetitions, right? can just perform thing first time every
time. Well, way shift curve can essentially establish stronger
connections neurons involved generating memory
behavior quickly. that? Well, order answer
look beautiful work James McGaugh Larry Cahill. James McGaugh
Larry Cahill number experiments several decades really based lot
animal literature, mainly focused humans really established required
get better remembering things quickly. want talk one
experiment particularly important. will provide link
paper, years old now, results still hold up. fact, results
established entire field memory neuroscience psychology.
human subjects come laboratory read short paragraph
12 sentences. key thing subjects read paragraph
pretty mundane. content, information within paragraph related
content previous sentence. cogent paragraph. Right, just wasn't
meaningless scramble words. described kind mundane set
circumstances. Maybe story someone walked room, sat
desk, wrote little bit, got lunch. know, just kind
mundane information. Not interesting. Another group subjects read also 12
sentence paragraph. paragraph included subset sentences lot


emotionally intense language. language evoke emotionally
intense response person reading it. might talked car accident
intense surgery. also positive stuff. Things like birthday party,
celebration kind. big sports win. words, two
conditions study. People either read boring paragraph, read really
emotionally laden paragraph. again, emotions either positive
negative emotions. Subjects left laboratory sometime later called back
laboratory say, no point experiment know
part memory experiment. Okay, don't even know reading
paragraph. came either class credit get paid. typically
things done college campuses elsewhere. come back lab
get pop quiz. asked recall content paragraph
read previously. Now probably expected, perhaps even obvious
you, subjects read emotionally intense paragraph remembered far
content paragraph far accurate remembering
information. Now, particular finding wasn't novel. Many people previously
described emotionally intense events better remembered non-emotionally
intense events. fact, way back 1600s Francis Bacon, largely credited
developing scientific method, said, quote, memory assisted anything
makes impression powerful passion. Inspiring fear, example, wonder,
shame, joy.

00:41:42 Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline

Francis Bacon said 1620. Jim McGaugh Larry Cahill certainly not
first demonstrate conceive idea emotionally laden experiences
easily remembered experiences. However, next
immensely important understanding memory building tools
enhance learning memory. evaluated capacity stress
particular neuro chemicals associated stress improve ability learn
information. Not just information emotional, information kinds.
going describe experiments done animal models just briefly,
experiments done humans subjects. McGaugh worked mainly animals,
also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively human subjects. take


rat mouse put arena one location animal receives
electrical shock come back next day, remove shock evoking
device let animal move around arena, animal will, quite
understandably, avoid location shocked. called conditioned place
aversion. affect avoiding particular location occurs one trial. good
example one trial learning. somehow animal knows shocked
location, remembers that. hippocampal dependent learning. animals lack
hippocampus hippocampus pharmacologically otherwise
incapacitated, will not learn new bit information. animals do,
remember first time every time. Unless, block release
certain chemicals brain body chemicals referring
epinephrine, adrenaline, extent corticosterones. Things like cortisol.
Now know effect getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine,
least particular experimental scenario. researchers exact
experiment, done exact experiment, introduce
pharmacological blocker epinephrine, epinephrine released response
shock, cannot actually bind receptors biological effects,
well animal perfectly happy tread back area received
shock. almost didn't know, assume, didn't remember
received shock location. seems pretty obvious hear it.
Something bad happens location, don't go back location.
condition place avoidance. turns opposite also true. Meaning
something called condition place preference can take animal, put arena,
feed reward one location arena. can give hungry rat
mouse food one particular location, take animal out, come back next day.
No food introduced, will go back location received food.
can variant this. can make arena little bit chilly provide
warmth location. can take male animal. turns male rats
mice will mate point. female animal particular called receptive
phase mating cycle give opportunity mate give location,
go back location wait away. perhaps people go back
bar, seat bar, restaurant wait one time they,
know, things worked them. Whatever context was. Condition place
preference. Condition place preference condition place avoidance depends


release adrenaline, right. not just stress. heightened
emotional state brain body. Okay, really important. not just
stress. can get one trial learning positive events, condition place preference.
can get one trial learning negative events. say positive negative,
putting called valence it. Making value judgment whether not
animal liked didn't like it. presume animal liked didn't like
felt. turns true humans well. know
McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning
episode immediately after? Well, ingest something drinking take
capsule form, period time gets absorbed body.
different substances, caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc absorbed gut
blood stream reach brain trigger affects brain body
different rates. not instantaneous. effects within minutes, others
within tens minutes on. really going depend pharmacology
things also going depend whether not food gut,
else happen circulating blood stream, etc. basic
level can confidently say not one, not dozens, mentioned
before, hundreds studies animals humans point fact triggering
increase adrenaline late learning immediately learning going
beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize
enhance improve memory, data McGaugh Cahill many
laboratories stemmed initial work really point fact ideal
protocol focus thing trying learn intensely. also
things like error rates, etc. Please see episodes learning.
newsletter learn better. can access HubermanLab.com. zero
cost newsletter. can grab PDF. lists things learning
about. Still try get excellent sleep. Again, fundamentally important mental health,
physical health, performance. can now extend performance saying
including learning memory. Nap doesn't interrupt nighttime sleep. Naps
anywhere 10 90 minutes. non-sleep deep rest protocols will enhance learning
memory, can now add that, spiking adrenaline provided can
done safe way, going reduce number repetitions required learn.
done tail end immediately learning about.
compatible protocols mentioned. reason revisiting
stuff sleep non-sleep deep rest think people got impression
need immediately learning today saying contrary.
Immediately learning need go heightened state emotionality
alertness. Now vitally important point not need pharmacology.
don't need caffeine. don't need Alpha GPC. don't need pharmacologic
substance spike adrenaline unless something already doing.
can safely. know can safely. always say, say
again, not physician not prescribing anything. professor, profess
things. need safe you. somebody not used
drinking caffeine suddenly drink four espresso trying learn something,


going severe increase alertness probably even anxiety.
panic attack prone, please don't start taking stimulants order learn things better.
Please safe. don't just say protect me, say protect you.
mention not accustomed taking something, always want first
check doctor, course,

01:04:48 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Deliberate Cold Exposure, Adrenaline

also move gradually, right? Start lowest effective dose. minimal
effective dose. sometimes minimal effective dose zero milligrams, nothing.
say that? Well, already talked results put people's arms
ice bath order evoke adrenaline release. welcome

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying

physical learning. want emphasize something physical learning
know number probably drinking cup coffee cup yerba
mate maybe even energy drink taking Alpha GPC something
physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work
matter, guest. think perfectly fine, provided safe you.
moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start
become afraid entire city blocks one bad thing happened particular room
particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise
specific nuanced every little detail. amygdala lumper
splitter comes sensory events. areas brain become
active very, specific conditions conditions. similarly,
epinephrine just molecule. just chemical circulating brain body.
no epinephrine specifically cold shower distinct epinephrine
associated bad event distinct epinephrine associated
really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts

roughly time, will strengthen connections. leads bias
probability neurons will active again. Now, vitally important
nowadays hear lot memories consequence new neurons
added brain. every time learn something, new connection
brain forms. Well, sorry break you, simply not case.
time, want emphasize most, not time learn
something existing neurons, not new neurons, existing neurons
strengthen connections co-activation over.
repetition or, important or, strong activation
once. fact, something called one trial learning whereby experience
something will remember thing forever. often associated
negative events, explain minutes. can also associated
positive events. Like first time saw romantic partner. something
happened romantic partner. first time saw child.
positive event, well extremely negative event. again,
repetition, guess label intensity. really mean say
intensity strong activation neurons can lay traces, circuits
far likely active again, not repetition not strong
activation circuits. mind, return original contrarian
question raised before. is, remember anything? Everyday
wake up, neurons brain body active. Different neural circuits
active. yet, remember small fraction things happen day.
yet, retain lot information previous days days
on. lot repetition extremely strong activation given
neural circuit will create new memories. minutes explain
get extremely strong activation particular neural circuits. Repetition pretty
obvious. Repetition repetition. minutes illustrate whole set
experiments whole set tools point can get extra strong
activation given neural circuit relates learning will remember
information, perhaps not just one trial learning,

00:20:50 Different Types Memory

certainly far fewer repetitions required otherwise. go


want preface discussion saying lot different
kinds memory. fact, take voyage neuroscience,
psychology memory find immense number different terms describe
immense number different types memory researchers focus on.
sake today's discussion, really just want focus short term memory, medium
term memory, longterm memory. still debate, always
case scientists, frankly, exact divisions short term, medium,
longterm memory, can broadly define short term memory longterm memory.
can describe couple different types think can relate
everyday life. common form short term memory going focus
called working memory. Working memory ability keep chain numbers
mind period time expectation really isn't remember
numbers next day certainly not next week. good example
phone number. tell ya phone number, 493-2938, well
probably remember it. 493-2938. came back tomorrow asked repeat
chain numbers, likely not. Unless, course, used particular
tool stamp memory mind commit longterm memory. Now
course, day age, people phone numbers programmed
phone don't really remember exact numbers. usually done
contact identity forth. different example probably
familiar security codes. try log unto app website
asks security code sent text messages can
either plug directly cases, remember short sequence
anywhere usually six seven, sometimes eight numbers. ability that,
switch back forth web pages apps plug number
remembering sequence plugging in, texting keying
keyboard, really good example working memory. Longterm memory,
sort going talking lot today ability commit certain
patterns information, either cognitive information motor information. Right,
ability move limbs particular sequence. long periods time.
remember day, week, month, maybe even year several
years later. got short term memory longterm memory. got
working memory sort keeping something online discarding okay. Not
online computer, online within brain. also two major categories


memory like know about. One explicit memory. not
necessarily explicit sort used thinking about. rather fact
can declare know something. explicit memory name.
Presumably explicit memory house apartment grew
in. know something know know it. can declare it. can
ask you, color first car owned? color
romantic partner's hair? sorts things. explicit declarative memory.
also explicit procedural memories. Now procedural memories, name
suggests, involve action sequences. simplest one, almost ridiculously simple,
walking. say, walk one room other? probably say,
well, go direction turn left. say, no, no, no. exactly
it? say, well, move left foot, right foot, left foot.
describe that. explicit procedural memory. much going
teach young toddler walk, probably say okay, good, good, try.
Okay, know, probably going pre-language toddler.
going encourage move one leg other. going encourage
reward moving one leg other. explicit
procedural memory walk. Okay, almost ridiculously simple. Maybe even truly
ridiculously simple, nonetheless, think context neural
circuits neural firing, pretty amazing. Even amazing fact explicit
memories, declarative procedural explicit memories can moved explicit
implicit. mean that? Well, example walking might
chuckled little bit kind shook head said, ridiculous thing ask.
walk one room next? just walk. just it. Ah, well, just
it? is, implicit understanding. Meaning nervous system
knows walk without actually think

00:25:40 Memory Formation Brain, Hippocampus

know walk. just get chair get
bed walk. brain structure. fact, one side
brain. called hippocampus. hippocampus literally means seahorse.
Anatomists like name brain structures things think brain
structures resemble. look hippocampus, frankly, doesn't look like


seahorse. either reflects lack understanding seahorse really looks
like, visual deficit, think fair say anatomists using little bit
creative elaboration thinking hippocampus looks like. Nonetheless,
curved structure. many layers. described colleague Robert
Sapolsky others looking like jelly roll cinnamon roll, looks
like me. take one cinnamon roll, chop middle. now
got two half cinnamon rolls rather put back together
configuration before, just slide one got essentially two
C's. Two C-shaped halves cinnamon roll push together, right,
slightly off set one another. Well, hippocampus looks like me.
think far better description actual physical structure. guess
use physical structure name, well open brain
atlas called two half-C cinnamon rolls stuffed halfway together.
not good. guess, seahorse will work. Hippocampus name
structure site brain, again, one side
brain, explicit declarative memories formed. not memories
stored maintained. established first place. contrast,
implicit memories, subconscious memories, formed stored elsewhere
brain. Mainly areas like cerebellum, also neocortex, kind outer shell
brain. cerebellum literally means mini-brain. fact look like
mini-brain. back brain. neocortex outer part
brain covers stuff. So, hippocampus vitally important

00:28:00 Hippocampus, Role Memory & Learning, Explicit vs. Implicit Memory

establishing new, declarative memories know know
do. Now, order really understand role hippocampus memory,
particular explicit declarative, explicit procedural memory really understand
distinct implicit declarative implicit procedural memories
look clinical case. clinical case referring patient went
name HM. Patient's go initials order maintain confidentiality real
identity. HM called intractable epilepsy. really
dramatic, so-called grand mal seizures, drop seizures. know
somebody epilepsy, epilepsy, might familiar this. can


petite mal seizures, minor seizures. can tonic clonic seizures,
sometimes not even detectable. can absent seizures people
will just stop, almost brain kind goes pause just stop there.
reported actually Einstein absent seizures. Although don't know
ever really confirmed neurologically. Grand mal seizures extremely severe
HM had. just going day maybe even cooking,
something, driving, operating kind machinery, sudden
just drop seizure. just physically drop go grand
mal seizure. convulsing whole body, loss consciousness, etc.
feel coming on. Often times people epilepsy can feel epileptic seizure coming
on. Kind like wave back brain. sometimes can get safe
circumstance, not always. frequency intensity seizures
robust neurosurgeons neurologists decided needed
locate origin, call foci seizures, remove brain tissue.
way seizures work spread focus, foci brain
tissue. unfortunately HM, focus seizures hippocampus.
lot deliberation, neurosurgeon, fact one famous neurosurgeons
world time, made called electrolytic lesions, actually burned
hippocampus brain HM. consequence, lost explicit memory.
Now consequence couldn't exist normal, everyday life, like
people. live mostly, not entirely, mostly kind hospital
setting. talked several people, say, met HM directly,
no longer alive. interaction might look like following.
walk just fine. wouldn't know kind brain damage.
walk fine, speak fine. say, hi, Andrew. say, hi,
whatever name happened be. wouldn't say HM, probably say
real name. perhaps someone new walk room. might turn
around, look person, us might do. turn around back
say, hi, name? say, well, just told name.
just told name, remember that? say, sorry, don't
remember that. name? go again.
complete lack explicit declarative memory. Now memory
previous events life dated way back, okay. Again, hinting idea
memories not necessarily stored hippocampus, just formed


hippocampus. moved hippocampus brain areas,
still keep memories. different database, will.
different pattern firing

00:31:49 Emotion & Memory Enhancement

neural circuits. couldn't form new memories. Now
important interesting twists HM not terms learning
memory teach us lot brain. fact, think neuroscientists
agree unfortunate case HM's epilepsy subsequent neuro
surgery taught us much know, least think about, terms
human learning memory. instance, mentioned before, still implicit
knowledge. knew walk. knew certain things like make cup
coffee. knew names people met much earlier life, on.
yet couldn't form new memories. Now, violation last statement,
elements HM's emotionality suggests sort
residual capacity learn new information wasn't normally think
explicit declarative procedural memory. instance, reported
said, say, don't know studies ever done intense
physiological measurements, tell HM joke, thought
funny, laugh really hard. liked jokes, say hey, HM, want tell
joke. tell joke laugh really hard. leave
room, come back, tell joke again. Now keep mind, not
remember told joke previously. second time laugh
little bit less. leave room, come back again. Say hi, Andrew.
say, oh, nice meet you. know, recall, can
recall things. couldn't recall things. didn't know just met you.
least couldn't remember it. tell joke third time, fourth time,
subsequent telling joke found little less funny. Just as, keep
mind, folks, tell joke get big laugh, don't tell again. least not
immediately. Not person crowd second time
little less funny third time little less funny. actually
whole element dopamine relationship surprise. topic
future podcast talk humor novelty brain. point


certain forms memory seem exist kind phantom like way within
HM's brain. mean that? Well, underscores implicit
memory heard joke before. suggests humor, least
find funny, somehow related procedures. Similar walking motor ability
precise content joke. right, little bit abstract
concept, point HM lacked explicit declarative memory. couldn't tell
just heard. not learn new information. couldn't tell
something unless learned something many years prior. Now,
lot patients besides HM brain lesions due
epilepsy, say due surgeries treat epilepsy, due strokes, due sadly
gunshot wounds forms call infarcts, infarct. I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct
word use describe damage particular brain region. many different
patients many different patterns infarct taught us lot memory
aspects brain work. HM really teaches us know
able consequence things aware learnings
passed off subconscious knowledge, body knows. brain
knows, don't know exactly know thing. tell story
HM's ability understand joke, repeated telling joke less
less less impact creating sense laughter, humor HM. Not just
anecdote flesh story, emotion turns way
can enhance memories even memories things not
funny, not intensely sad, not immensely happy don't evoke really strong
emotional response, even emotional response. reason
emotions, just like perception, just like sensation, consequence particular
neuro chemicals present brain body. going tell next,
particular neuro chemicals can leverage order learn specific
information faster remember much longer period time, maybe even
forever. can leveraging relationship nervous system

00:36:44 Tool: Emotion Saliency & Improved Memory

brain body. body back brain. talk
tools enhancing memory. Now one tool absolutely clear works.
always worked, works now, will work forever. repetition.


often perform something recite something, likely
remember future. might seem obvious, worth thinking
happening repeat something. say happening, mean
neural level. happening encouraging firing particular
chains neurons reside particular circuit, right. particular sequence
neurons playing neuron A, B, C, D played particular sequence
again. repetitions, get strengthening nerve
connections. Now, repetition works problem people either don't
patience, don't time, sometimes literally don't
time got deadline something trying remember
learn. simply like able remember things better general
remember quickly. process accelerating repetition based learning
learning curve doesn't go perform something 1,000 times
gradually time 1,000, 750 times day, 500 times day, 300 times day,
no repetitions, right? can just perform thing first time every
time. Well, way shift curve can essentially establish stronger
connections neurons involved generating memory
behavior quickly. that? Well, order answer
look beautiful work James McGaugh Larry Cahill. James McGaugh
Larry Cahill number experiments several decades really based lot
animal literature, mainly focused humans really established required
get better remembering things quickly. want talk one
experiment particularly important. will provide link
paper, years old now, results still hold up. fact, results
established entire field memory neuroscience psychology.
human subjects come laboratory read short paragraph
12 sentences. key thing subjects read paragraph
pretty mundane. content, information within paragraph related
content previous sentence. cogent paragraph. Right, just wasn't
meaningless scramble words. described kind mundane set
circumstances. Maybe story someone walked room, sat
desk, wrote little bit, got lunch. know, just kind
mundane information. Not interesting. Another group subjects read also 12
sentence paragraph. paragraph included subset sentences lot


emotionally intense language. language evoke emotionally
intense response person reading it. might talked car accident
intense surgery. also positive stuff. Things like birthday party,
celebration kind. big sports win. words, two
conditions study. People either read boring paragraph, read really
emotionally laden paragraph. again, emotions either positive
negative emotions. Subjects left laboratory sometime later called back
laboratory say, no point experiment know
part memory experiment. Okay, don't even know reading
paragraph. came either class credit get paid. typically
things done college campuses elsewhere. come back lab
get pop quiz. asked recall content paragraph
read previously. Now probably expected, perhaps even obvious
you, subjects read emotionally intense paragraph remembered far
content paragraph far accurate remembering
information. Now, particular finding wasn't novel. Many people previously
described emotionally intense events better remembered non-emotionally
intense events. fact, way back 1600s Francis Bacon, largely credited
developing scientific method, said, quote, memory assisted anything
makes impression powerful passion. Inspiring fear, example, wonder,
shame, joy.

00:41:42 Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline

Francis Bacon said 1620. Jim McGaugh Larry Cahill certainly not
first demonstrate conceive idea emotionally laden experiences
easily remembered experiences. However, next
immensely important understanding memory building tools
enhance learning memory. evaluated capacity stress
particular neuro chemicals associated stress improve ability learn
information. Not just information emotional, information kinds.
going describe experiments done animal models just briefly,
experiments done humans subjects. McGaugh worked mainly animals,
also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively human subjects. take


rat mouse put arena one location animal receives
electrical shock come back next day, remove shock evoking
device let animal move around arena, animal will, quite
understandably, avoid location shocked. called conditioned place
aversion. affect avoiding particular location occurs one trial. good
example one trial learning. somehow animal knows shocked
location, remembers that. hippocampal dependent learning. animals lack
hippocampus hippocampus pharmacologically otherwise
incapacitated, will not learn new bit information. animals do,
remember first time every time. Unless, block release
certain chemicals brain body chemicals referring
epinephrine, adrenaline, extent corticosterones. Things like cortisol.
Now know effect getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine,
least particular experimental scenario. researchers exact
experiment, done exact experiment, introduce
pharmacological blocker epinephrine, epinephrine released response
shock, cannot actually bind receptors biological effects,
well animal perfectly happy tread back area received
shock. almost didn't know, assume, didn't remember
received shock location. seems pretty obvious hear it.
Something bad happens location, don't go back location.
condition place avoidance. turns opposite also true. Meaning
something called condition place preference can take animal, put arena,
feed reward one location arena. can give hungry rat
mouse food one particular location, take animal out, come back next day.
No food introduced, will go back location received food.
can variant this. can make arena little bit chilly provide
warmth location. can take male animal. turns male rats
mice will mate point. female animal particular called receptive
phase mating cycle give opportunity mate give location,
go back location wait away. perhaps people go back
bar, seat bar, restaurant wait one time they,
know, things worked them. Whatever context was. Condition place
preference. Condition place preference condition place avoidance depends


release adrenaline, right. not just stress. heightened
emotional state brain body. Okay, really important. not just
stress. can get one trial learning positive events, condition place preference.
can get one trial learning negative events. say positive negative,
putting called valence it. Making value judgment whether not
animal liked didn't like it. presume animal liked didn't like
felt. turns true humans well. know
McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning
episode immediately after? Well, ingest something drinking take
capsule form, period time gets absorbed body.
different substances, caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc absorbed gut
blood stream reach brain trigger affects brain body
different rates. not instantaneous. effects within minutes, others
within tens minutes on. really going depend pharmacology
things also going depend whether not food gut,
else happen circulating blood stream, etc. basic
level can confidently say not one, not dozens, mentioned
before, hundreds studies animals humans point fact triggering
increase adrenaline late learning immediately learning going
beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize
enhance improve memory, data McGaugh Cahill many
laboratories stemmed initial work really point fact ideal
protocol focus thing trying learn intensely. also
things like error rates, etc. Please see episodes learning.
newsletter learn better. can access HubermanLab.com. zero
cost newsletter. can grab PDF. lists things learning
about. Still try get excellent sleep. Again, fundamentally important mental health,
physical health, performance. can now extend performance saying
including learning memory. Nap doesn't interrupt nighttime sleep. Naps
anywhere 10 90 minutes. non-sleep deep rest protocols will enhance learning
memory, can now add that, spiking adrenaline provided can
done safe way, going reduce number repetitions required learn.
done tail end immediately learning about.
compatible protocols mentioned. reason revisiting
stuff sleep non-sleep deep rest think people got impression
need immediately learning today saying contrary.
Immediately learning need go heightened state emotionality
alertness. Now vitally important point not need pharmacology.
don't need caffeine. don't need Alpha GPC. don't need pharmacologic
substance spike adrenaline unless something already doing.
can safely. know can safely. always say, say
again, not physician not prescribing anything. professor, profess
things. need safe you. somebody not used
drinking caffeine suddenly drink four espresso trying learn something,


going severe increase alertness probably even anxiety.
panic attack prone, please don't start taking stimulants order learn things better.
Please safe. don't just say protect me, say protect you.
mention not accustomed taking something, always want first
check doctor, course,

01:04:48 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Deliberate Cold Exposure, Adrenaline

also move gradually, right? Start lowest effective dose. minimal
effective dose. sometimes minimal effective dose zero milligrams, nothing.
say that? Well, already talked results put people's arms
ice bath order evoke adrenaline release. welcome
want. fact, pretty low cost, zero pharmacology. least exogenous
pharmacology way approach whole thing. way evoking
natural epinephrine turns also dopamine release. take cold shower.
ice bath get cold circulating bath. done several episodes
utility cold health performance. can find episodes
HubermanLab.com. Also episode colleague Stanford biology
department, Dr. Craig Heller. Lots protocols, particular episode cold
health performance. describe best use cold shower ice bath
circulating cold bath order evoke epinephrine dopamine release.
point time want protocols after, ideally
immediately learning about. Meaning sitting learn new
information trying learn new physical skill. Now whether not
compatible reasons deliberate cold exposure, whether
not compatible things doing, depends contour
lifestyle, training, academic goals, learning goals, etc.
specific purpose enhance learning memory, want spike adrenaline
afterwards. telling can caffeine. can
Alpha GPC. can combination caffeine Alpha GPC.
can safely. know using forms pharmacology.
long episode ADHD. just really declare stance clearly
not fan, actually opposed people using prescription drugs not
prescribed drugs order enhance alertness. think big addictive


potential. also potential really disrupt one's pharmacology around
dopaminergic system. However, know prescribed things like ritalin,
Adderall modafinil things sort order increase alertness focus.
prescribed things board certified physician,
going decide going take trying learn
trying learn. also take consideration drugs
long acting. shorter acting. time according trying
learn when. pharmacology. mentioned, behavioral
protocols. can use cold cold excellent stimulus first all,
doesn't involve pharmacology. Second all, can generally access low zero
cost, especially cold shower approach. third, can titrate it. can start
warmer water. can make very, cold thing able
tolerate safely. can make moderately cold. cold order
invoke adrenaline release? Well, uncomfortably cold cold enough
feel like really want get out, can stay safely. going evoke
adrenaline release. quickens breathing, makes go wide eyed.
increasing adrenaline release. fact, effects going wide eyed quickening
breathing challenges thinking clearly, direct effects
adrenaline brain body. course, ways increase
adrenaline. go hard run. number things
increase adrenaline body. things choose you,
clear, solid grounding research data, can confidently say spiking
adrenaline interacting material, physical cognitive material

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't

physical learning. want emphasize something physical learning
know number probably drinking cup coffee cup yerba
mate maybe even energy drink taking Alpha GPC something
physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work

moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start
become afraid entire city blocks one bad thing happened particular room
particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise
specific nuanced every little detail. amygdala lumper
splitter comes sensory events. areas brain become
active very, specific conditions conditions. similarly,
epinephrine just molecule. just chemical circulating brain body.
no epinephrine specifically cold shower distinct epinephrine
associated bad event distinct epinephrine associated
really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts

want preface discussion saying lot different
kinds memory. fact, take voyage neuroscience,
psychology memory find immense number different terms describe
immense number different types memory researchers focus on.
sake today's discussion, really just want focus short term memory, medium
term memory, longterm memory. still debate, always
case scientists, frankly, exact divisions short term, medium,
longterm memory, can broadly define short term memory longterm memory.
can describe couple different types think can relate
everyday life. common form short term memory going focus
called working memory. Working memory ability keep chain numbers
mind period time expectation really isn't remember
numbers next day certainly not next week. good example
phone number. tell ya phone number, 493-2938, well
probably remember it. 493-2938. came back tomorrow asked repeat
chain numbers, likely not. Unless, course, used particular
tool stamp memory mind commit longterm memory. Now
course, day age, people phone numbers programmed
phone don't really remember exact numbers. usually done
contact identity forth. different example probably
familiar security codes. try log unto app website
asks security code sent text messages can
either plug directly cases, remember short sequence
anywhere usually six seven, sometimes eight numbers. ability that,
switch back forth web pages apps plug number
remembering sequence plugging in, texting keying
keyboard, really good example working memory. Longterm memory,
sort going talking lot today ability commit certain
patterns information, either cognitive information motor information. Right,
ability move limbs particular sequence. long periods time.
remember day, week, month, maybe even year several
years later. got short term memory longterm memory. got
working memory sort keeping something online discarding okay. Not
online computer, online within brain. also two major categories


memory like know about. One explicit memory. not
necessarily explicit sort used thinking about. rather fact
can declare know something. explicit memory name.
Presumably explicit memory house apartment grew
in. know something know know it. can declare it. can
ask you, color first car owned? color
romantic partner's hair? sorts things. explicit declarative memory.
also explicit procedural memories. Now procedural memories, name
suggests, involve action sequences. simplest one, almost ridiculously simple,
walking. say, walk one room other? probably say,
well, go direction turn left. say, no, no, no. exactly
it? say, well, move left foot, right foot, left foot.
describe that. explicit procedural memory. much going
teach young toddler walk, probably say okay, good, good, try.
Okay, know, probably going pre-language toddler.
going encourage move one leg other. going encourage
reward moving one leg other. explicit
procedural memory walk. Okay, almost ridiculously simple. Maybe even truly
ridiculously simple, nonetheless, think context neural
circuits neural firing, pretty amazing. Even amazing fact explicit
memories, declarative procedural explicit memories can moved explicit
implicit. mean that? Well, example walking might
chuckled little bit kind shook head said, ridiculous thing ask.
walk one room next? just walk. just it. Ah, well, just
it? is, implicit understanding. Meaning nervous system
knows walk without actually think

00:25:40 Memory Formation Brain, Hippocampus

know walk. just get chair get
bed walk. brain structure. fact, one side
brain. called hippocampus. hippocampus literally means seahorse.
Anatomists like name brain structures things think brain
structures resemble. look hippocampus, frankly, doesn't look like


seahorse. either reflects lack understanding seahorse really looks
like, visual deficit, think fair say anatomists using little bit
creative elaboration thinking hippocampus looks like. Nonetheless,
curved structure. many layers. described colleague Robert
Sapolsky others looking like jelly roll cinnamon roll, looks
like me. take one cinnamon roll, chop middle. now
got two half cinnamon rolls rather put back together
configuration before, just slide one got essentially two
C's. Two C-shaped halves cinnamon roll push together, right,
slightly off set one another. Well, hippocampus looks like me.
think far better description actual physical structure. guess
use physical structure name, well open brain
atlas called two half-C cinnamon rolls stuffed halfway together.
not good. guess, seahorse will work. Hippocampus name
structure site brain, again, one side
brain, explicit declarative memories formed. not memories
stored maintained. established first place. contrast,
implicit memories, subconscious memories, formed stored elsewhere
brain. Mainly areas like cerebellum, also neocortex, kind outer shell
brain. cerebellum literally means mini-brain. fact look like
mini-brain. back brain. neocortex outer part
brain covers stuff. So, hippocampus vitally important

00:28:00 Hippocampus, Role Memory & Learning, Explicit vs. Implicit Memory

establishing new, declarative memories know know
do. Now, order really understand role hippocampus memory,
particular explicit declarative, explicit procedural memory really understand
distinct implicit declarative implicit procedural memories
look clinical case. clinical case referring patient went
name HM. Patient's go initials order maintain confidentiality real
identity. HM called intractable epilepsy. really
dramatic, so-called grand mal seizures, drop seizures. know
somebody epilepsy, epilepsy, might familiar this. can


petite mal seizures, minor seizures. can tonic clonic seizures,
sometimes not even detectable. can absent seizures people
will just stop, almost brain kind goes pause just stop there.
reported actually Einstein absent seizures. Although don't know
ever really confirmed neurologically. Grand mal seizures extremely severe
HM had. just going day maybe even cooking,
something, driving, operating kind machinery, sudden
just drop seizure. just physically drop go grand
mal seizure. convulsing whole body, loss consciousness, etc.
feel coming on. Often times people epilepsy can feel epileptic seizure coming
on. Kind like wave back brain. sometimes can get safe
circumstance, not always. frequency intensity seizures
robust neurosurgeons neurologists decided needed
locate origin, call foci seizures, remove brain tissue.
way seizures work spread focus, foci brain
tissue. unfortunately HM, focus seizures hippocampus.
lot deliberation, neurosurgeon, fact one famous neurosurgeons
world time, made called electrolytic lesions, actually burned
hippocampus brain HM. consequence, lost explicit memory.
Now consequence couldn't exist normal, everyday life, like
people. live mostly, not entirely, mostly kind hospital
setting. talked several people, say, met HM directly,
no longer alive. interaction might look like following.
walk just fine. wouldn't know kind brain damage.
walk fine, speak fine. say, hi, Andrew. say, hi,
whatever name happened be. wouldn't say HM, probably say
real name. perhaps someone new walk room. might turn
around, look person, us might do. turn around back
say, hi, name? say, well, just told name.
just told name, remember that? say, sorry, don't
remember that. name? go again.
complete lack explicit declarative memory. Now memory
previous events life dated way back, okay. Again, hinting idea
memories not necessarily stored hippocampus, just formed


hippocampus. moved hippocampus brain areas,
still keep memories. different database, will.
different pattern firing

00:31:49 Emotion & Memory Enhancement

neural circuits. couldn't form new memories. Now
important interesting twists HM not terms learning
memory teach us lot brain. fact, think neuroscientists
agree unfortunate case HM's epilepsy subsequent neuro
surgery taught us much know, least think about, terms
human learning memory. instance, mentioned before, still implicit
knowledge. knew walk. knew certain things like make cup
coffee. knew names people met much earlier life, on.
yet couldn't form new memories. Now, violation last statement,
elements HM's emotionality suggests sort
residual capacity learn new information wasn't normally think
explicit declarative procedural memory. instance, reported
said, say, don't know studies ever done intense
physiological measurements, tell HM joke, thought
funny, laugh really hard. liked jokes, say hey, HM, want tell
joke. tell joke laugh really hard. leave
room, come back, tell joke again. Now keep mind, not
remember told joke previously. second time laugh
little bit less. leave room, come back again. Say hi, Andrew.
say, oh, nice meet you. know, recall, can
recall things. couldn't recall things. didn't know just met you.
least couldn't remember it. tell joke third time, fourth time,
subsequent telling joke found little less funny. Just as, keep
mind, folks, tell joke get big laugh, don't tell again. least not
immediately. Not person crowd second time
little less funny third time little less funny. actually
whole element dopamine relationship surprise. topic
future podcast talk humor novelty brain. point


certain forms memory seem exist kind phantom like way within
HM's brain. mean that? Well, underscores implicit
memory heard joke before. suggests humor, least
find funny, somehow related procedures. Similar walking motor ability
precise content joke. right, little bit abstract
concept, point HM lacked explicit declarative memory. couldn't tell
just heard. not learn new information. couldn't tell
something unless learned something many years prior. Now,
lot patients besides HM brain lesions due
epilepsy, say due surgeries treat epilepsy, due strokes, due sadly
gunshot wounds forms call infarcts, infarct. I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct
word use describe damage particular brain region. many different
patients many different patterns infarct taught us lot memory
aspects brain work. HM really teaches us know
able consequence things aware learnings
passed off subconscious knowledge, body knows. brain
knows, don't know exactly know thing. tell story
HM's ability understand joke, repeated telling joke less
less less impact creating sense laughter, humor HM. Not just
anecdote flesh story, emotion turns way
can enhance memories even memories things not
funny, not intensely sad, not immensely happy don't evoke really strong
emotional response, even emotional response. reason
emotions, just like perception, just like sensation, consequence particular
neuro chemicals present brain body. going tell next,
particular neuro chemicals can leverage order learn specific
information faster remember much longer period time, maybe even
forever. can leveraging relationship nervous system

00:36:44 Tool: Emotion Saliency & Improved Memory

brain body. body back brain. talk
tools enhancing memory. Now one tool absolutely clear works.
always worked, works now, will work forever. repetition.


often perform something recite something, likely
remember future. might seem obvious, worth thinking
happening repeat something. say happening, mean
neural level. happening encouraging firing particular
chains neurons reside particular circuit, right. particular sequence
neurons playing neuron A, B, C, D played particular sequence
again. repetitions, get strengthening nerve
connections. Now, repetition works problem people either don't
patience, don't time, sometimes literally don't
time got deadline something trying remember
learn. simply like able remember things better general
remember quickly. process accelerating repetition based learning
learning curve doesn't go perform something 1,000 times
gradually time 1,000, 750 times day, 500 times day, 300 times day,
no repetitions, right? can just perform thing first time every
time. Well, way shift curve can essentially establish stronger
connections neurons involved generating memory
behavior quickly. that? Well, order answer
look beautiful work James McGaugh Larry Cahill. James McGaugh
Larry Cahill number experiments several decades really based lot
animal literature, mainly focused humans really established required
get better remembering things quickly. want talk one
experiment particularly important. will provide link
paper, years old now, results still hold up. fact, results
established entire field memory neuroscience psychology.
human subjects come laboratory read short paragraph
12 sentences. key thing subjects read paragraph
pretty mundane. content, information within paragraph related
content previous sentence. cogent paragraph. Right, just wasn't
meaningless scramble words. described kind mundane set
circumstances. Maybe story someone walked room, sat
desk, wrote little bit, got lunch. know, just kind
mundane information. Not interesting. Another group subjects read also 12
sentence paragraph. paragraph included subset sentences lot


emotionally intense language. language evoke emotionally
intense response person reading it. might talked car accident
intense surgery. also positive stuff. Things like birthday party,
celebration kind. big sports win. words, two
conditions study. People either read boring paragraph, read really
emotionally laden paragraph. again, emotions either positive
negative emotions. Subjects left laboratory sometime later called back
laboratory say, no point experiment know
part memory experiment. Okay, don't even know reading
paragraph. came either class credit get paid. typically
things done college campuses elsewhere. come back lab
get pop quiz. asked recall content paragraph
read previously. Now probably expected, perhaps even obvious
you, subjects read emotionally intense paragraph remembered far
content paragraph far accurate remembering
information. Now, particular finding wasn't novel. Many people previously
described emotionally intense events better remembered non-emotionally
intense events. fact, way back 1600s Francis Bacon, largely credited
developing scientific method, said, quote, memory assisted anything
makes impression powerful passion. Inspiring fear, example, wonder,
shame, joy.

00:41:42 Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline

Francis Bacon said 1620. Jim McGaugh Larry Cahill certainly not
first demonstrate conceive idea emotionally laden experiences
easily remembered experiences. However, next
immensely important understanding memory building tools
enhance learning memory. evaluated capacity stress
particular neuro chemicals associated stress improve ability learn
information. Not just information emotional, information kinds.
going describe experiments done animal models just briefly,
experiments done humans subjects. McGaugh worked mainly animals,
also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively human subjects. take


rat mouse put arena one location animal receives
electrical shock come back next day, remove shock evoking
device let animal move around arena, animal will, quite
understandably, avoid location shocked. called conditioned place
aversion. affect avoiding particular location occurs one trial. good
example one trial learning. somehow animal knows shocked
location, remembers that. hippocampal dependent learning. animals lack
hippocampus hippocampus pharmacologically otherwise
incapacitated, will not learn new bit information. animals do,
remember first time every time. Unless, block release
certain chemicals brain body chemicals referring
epinephrine, adrenaline, extent corticosterones. Things like cortisol.
Now know effect getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine,
least particular experimental scenario. researchers exact
experiment, done exact experiment, introduce
pharmacological blocker epinephrine, epinephrine released response
shock, cannot actually bind receptors biological effects,
well animal perfectly happy tread back area received
shock. almost didn't know, assume, didn't remember
received shock location. seems pretty obvious hear it.
Something bad happens location, don't go back location.
condition place avoidance. turns opposite also true. Meaning
something called condition place preference can take animal, put arena,
feed reward one location arena. can give hungry rat
mouse food one particular location, take animal out, come back next day.
No food introduced, will go back location received food.
can variant this. can make arena little bit chilly provide
warmth location. can take male animal. turns male rats
mice will mate point. female animal particular called receptive
phase mating cycle give opportunity mate give location,
go back location wait away. perhaps people go back
bar, seat bar, restaurant wait one time they,
know, things worked them. Whatever context was. Condition place
preference. Condition place preference condition place avoidance depends


release adrenaline, right. not just stress. heightened
emotional state brain body. Okay, really important. not just
stress. can get one trial learning positive events, condition place preference.
can get one trial learning negative events. say positive negative,
putting called valence it. Making value judgment whether not
animal liked didn't like it. presume animal liked didn't like
felt. turns true humans well. know
McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning
episode immediately after? Well, ingest something drinking take
capsule form, period time gets absorbed body.
different substances, caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc absorbed gut
blood stream reach brain trigger affects brain body
different rates. not instantaneous. effects within minutes, others
within tens minutes on. really going depend pharmacology
things also going depend whether not food gut,
else happen circulating blood stream, etc. basic
level can confidently say not one, not dozens, mentioned
before, hundreds studies animals humans point fact triggering
increase adrenaline late learning immediately learning going
beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize
enhance improve memory, data McGaugh Cahill many
laboratories stemmed initial work really point fact ideal
protocol focus thing trying learn intensely. also
things like error rates, etc. Please see episodes learning.
newsletter learn better. can access HubermanLab.com. zero
cost newsletter. can grab PDF. lists things learning
about. Still try get excellent sleep. Again, fundamentally important mental health,
physical health, performance. can now extend performance saying
including learning memory. Nap doesn't interrupt nighttime sleep. Naps
anywhere 10 90 minutes. non-sleep deep rest protocols will enhance learning
memory, can now add that, spiking adrenaline provided can
done safe way, going reduce number repetitions required learn.
done tail end immediately learning about.
compatible protocols mentioned. reason revisiting
stuff sleep non-sleep deep rest think people got impression
need immediately learning today saying contrary.
Immediately learning need go heightened state emotionality
alertness. Now vitally important point not need pharmacology.
don't need caffeine. don't need Alpha GPC. don't need pharmacologic
substance spike adrenaline unless something already doing.
can safely. know can safely. always say, say
again, not physician not prescribing anything. professor, profess
things. need safe you. somebody not used
drinking caffeine suddenly drink four espresso trying learn something,


going severe increase alertness probably even anxiety.
panic attack prone, please don't start taking stimulants order learn things better.
Please safe. don't just say protect me, say protect you.
mention not accustomed taking something, always want first
check doctor, course,

01:04:48 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Deliberate Cold Exposure, Adrenaline

also move gradually, right? Start lowest effective dose. minimal
effective dose. sometimes minimal effective dose zero milligrams, nothing.
say that? Well, already talked results put people's arms
ice bath order evoke adrenaline release. welcome
want. fact, pretty low cost, zero pharmacology. least exogenous
pharmacology way approach whole thing. way evoking
natural epinephrine turns also dopamine release. take cold shower.
ice bath get cold circulating bath. done several episodes
utility cold health performance. can find episodes
HubermanLab.com. Also episode colleague Stanford biology
department, Dr. Craig Heller. Lots protocols, particular episode cold
health performance. describe best use cold shower ice bath
circulating cold bath order evoke epinephrine dopamine release.
point time want protocols after, ideally
immediately learning about. Meaning sitting learn new
information trying learn new physical skill. Now whether not
compatible reasons deliberate cold exposure, whether
not compatible things doing, depends contour
lifestyle, training, academic goals, learning goals, etc.
specific purpose enhance learning memory, want spike adrenaline
afterwards. telling can caffeine. can
Alpha GPC. can combination caffeine Alpha GPC.
can safely. know using forms pharmacology.
long episode ADHD. just really declare stance clearly
not fan, actually opposed people using prescription drugs not
prescribed drugs order enhance alertness. think big addictive


potential. also potential really disrupt one's pharmacology around
dopaminergic system. However, know prescribed things like ritalin,
Adderall modafinil things sort order increase alertness focus.
prescribed things board certified physician,
going decide going take trying learn
trying learn. also take consideration drugs
long acting. shorter acting. time according trying
learn when. pharmacology. mentioned, behavioral
protocols. can use cold cold excellent stimulus first all,
doesn't involve pharmacology. Second all, can generally access low zero
cost, especially cold shower approach. third, can titrate it. can start
warmer water. can make very, cold thing able
tolerate safely. can make moderately cold. cold order
invoke adrenaline release? Well, uncomfortably cold cold enough
feel like really want get out, can stay safely. going evoke
adrenaline release. quickens breathing, makes go wide eyed.
increasing adrenaline release. fact, effects going wide eyed quickening
breathing challenges thinking clearly, direct effects
adrenaline brain body. course, ways increase
adrenaline. go hard run. number things
increase adrenaline body. things choose you,
clear, solid grounding research data, can confidently say spiking
adrenaline interacting material, physical cognitive material

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data
epinephrine release, better people remembered material.
shown. Whether not cognitive material, learning
language, learning passage words, learning mathematics. whether not
physical learning. want emphasize something physical learning
know number probably drinking cup coffee cup yerba
mate maybe even energy drink taking Alpha GPC something
physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work
matter, guest. think perfectly fine, provided safe you.
moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline

actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital

incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated

sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real

especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body

going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition

decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue

mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise

neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human

Presumably explicit memory house apartment grew
in. know something know know it. can declare it. can
ask you, color first car owned? color
romantic partner's hair? sorts things. explicit declarative memory.
also explicit procedural memories. Now procedural memories, name
suggests, involve action sequences. simplest one, almost ridiculously simple,
walking. say, walk one room other? probably say,
well, go direction turn left. say, no, no, no. exactly
it? say, well, move left foot, right foot, left foot.
describe that. explicit procedural memory. much going
teach young toddler walk, probably say okay, good, good, try.
Okay, know, probably going pre-language toddler.
going encourage move one leg other. going encourage
reward moving one leg other. explicit
procedural memory walk. Okay, almost ridiculously simple. Maybe even truly
ridiculously simple, nonetheless, think context neural
circuits neural firing, pretty amazing. Even amazing fact explicit
memories, declarative procedural explicit memories can moved explicit
implicit. mean that? Well, example walking might
chuckled little bit kind shook head said, ridiculous thing ask.
walk one room next? just walk. just it. Ah, well, just
it? is, implicit understanding. Meaning nervous system
knows walk without actually think

00:25:40 Memory Formation Brain, Hippocampus

know walk. just get chair get
bed walk. brain structure. fact, one side
brain. called hippocampus. hippocampus literally means seahorse.
Anatomists like name brain structures things think brain
structures resemble. look hippocampus, frankly, doesn't look like


seahorse. either reflects lack understanding seahorse really looks
like, visual deficit, think fair say anatomists using little bit
creative elaboration thinking hippocampus looks like. Nonetheless,
curved structure. many layers. described colleague Robert
Sapolsky others looking like jelly roll cinnamon roll, looks
like me. take one cinnamon roll, chop middle. now
got two half cinnamon rolls rather put back together
configuration before, just slide one got essentially two
C's. Two C-shaped halves cinnamon roll push together, right,
slightly off set one another. Well, hippocampus looks like me.
think far better description actual physical structure. guess
use physical structure name, well open brain
atlas called two half-C cinnamon rolls stuffed halfway together.
not good. guess, seahorse will work. Hippocampus name
structure site brain, again, one side
brain, explicit declarative memories formed. not memories
stored maintained. established first place. contrast,
implicit memories, subconscious memories, formed stored elsewhere
brain. Mainly areas like cerebellum, also neocortex, kind outer shell
brain. cerebellum literally means mini-brain. fact look like
mini-brain. back brain. neocortex outer part
brain covers stuff. So, hippocampus vitally important

00:28:00 Hippocampus, Role Memory & Learning, Explicit vs. Implicit Memory

establishing new, declarative memories know know
do. Now, order really understand role hippocampus memory,
particular explicit declarative, explicit procedural memory really understand
distinct implicit declarative implicit procedural memories
look clinical case. clinical case referring patient went
name HM. Patient's go initials order maintain confidentiality real
identity. HM called intractable epilepsy. really
dramatic, so-called grand mal seizures, drop seizures. know
somebody epilepsy, epilepsy, might familiar this. can


petite mal seizures, minor seizures. can tonic clonic seizures,
sometimes not even detectable. can absent seizures people
will just stop, almost brain kind goes pause just stop there.
reported actually Einstein absent seizures. Although don't know
ever really confirmed neurologically. Grand mal seizures extremely severe
HM had. just going day maybe even cooking,
something, driving, operating kind machinery, sudden
just drop seizure. just physically drop go grand
mal seizure. convulsing whole body, loss consciousness, etc.
feel coming on. Often times people epilepsy can feel epileptic seizure coming
on. Kind like wave back brain. sometimes can get safe
circumstance, not always. frequency intensity seizures
robust neurosurgeons neurologists decided needed
locate origin, call foci seizures, remove brain tissue.
way seizures work spread focus, foci brain
tissue. unfortunately HM, focus seizures hippocampus.
lot deliberation, neurosurgeon, fact one famous neurosurgeons
world time, made called electrolytic lesions, actually burned
hippocampus brain HM. consequence, lost explicit memory.
Now consequence couldn't exist normal, everyday life, like
people. live mostly, not entirely, mostly kind hospital
setting. talked several people, say, met HM directly,
no longer alive. interaction might look like following.
walk just fine. wouldn't know kind brain damage.
walk fine, speak fine. say, hi, Andrew. say, hi,
whatever name happened be. wouldn't say HM, probably say
real name. perhaps someone new walk room. might turn
around, look person, us might do. turn around back
say, hi, name? say, well, just told name.
just told name, remember that? say, sorry, don't
remember that. name? go again.
complete lack explicit declarative memory. Now memory
previous events life dated way back, okay. Again, hinting idea
memories not necessarily stored hippocampus, just formed


hippocampus. moved hippocampus brain areas,
still keep memories. different database, will.
different pattern firing

00:31:49 Emotion & Memory Enhancement

neural circuits. couldn't form new memories. Now
important interesting twists HM not terms learning
memory teach us lot brain. fact, think neuroscientists
agree unfortunate case HM's epilepsy subsequent neuro
surgery taught us much know, least think about, terms
human learning memory. instance, mentioned before, still implicit
knowledge. knew walk. knew certain things like make cup
coffee. knew names people met much earlier life, on.
yet couldn't form new memories. Now, violation last statement,
elements HM's emotionality suggests sort
residual capacity learn new information wasn't normally think
explicit declarative procedural memory. instance, reported
said, say, don't know studies ever done intense
physiological measurements, tell HM joke, thought
funny, laugh really hard. liked jokes, say hey, HM, want tell
joke. tell joke laugh really hard. leave
room, come back, tell joke again. Now keep mind, not
remember told joke previously. second time laugh
little bit less. leave room, come back again. Say hi, Andrew.
say, oh, nice meet you. know, recall, can
recall things. couldn't recall things. didn't know just met you.
least couldn't remember it. tell joke third time, fourth time,
subsequent telling joke found little less funny. Just as, keep
mind, folks, tell joke get big laugh, don't tell again. least not
immediately. Not person crowd second time
little less funny third time little less funny. actually
whole element dopamine relationship surprise. topic
future podcast talk humor novelty brain. point


certain forms memory seem exist kind phantom like way within
HM's brain. mean that? Well, underscores implicit
memory heard joke before. suggests humor, least
find funny, somehow related procedures. Similar walking motor ability
precise content joke. right, little bit abstract
concept, point HM lacked explicit declarative memory. couldn't tell
just heard. not learn new information. couldn't tell
something unless learned something many years prior. Now,
lot patients besides HM brain lesions due
epilepsy, say due surgeries treat epilepsy, due strokes, due sadly
gunshot wounds forms call infarcts, infarct. I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct
word use describe damage particular brain region. many different
patients many different patterns infarct taught us lot memory
aspects brain work. HM really teaches us know
able consequence things aware learnings
passed off subconscious knowledge, body knows. brain
knows, don't know exactly know thing. tell story
HM's ability understand joke, repeated telling joke less
less less impact creating sense laughter, humor HM. Not just
anecdote flesh story, emotion turns way
can enhance memories even memories things not
funny, not intensely sad, not immensely happy don't evoke really strong
emotional response, even emotional response. reason
emotions, just like perception, just like sensation, consequence particular
neuro chemicals present brain body. going tell next,
particular neuro chemicals can leverage order learn specific
information faster remember much longer period time, maybe even
forever. can leveraging relationship nervous system

tools enhancing memory. Now one tool absolutely clear works.
always worked, works now, will work forever. repetition.


often perform something recite something, likely
remember future. might seem obvious, worth thinking
happening repeat something. say happening, mean

remember quickly. process accelerating repetition based learning
learning curve doesn't go perform something 1,000 times
gradually time 1,000, 750 times day, 500 times day, 300 times day,
no repetitions, right? can just perform thing first time every
time. Well, way shift curve can essentially establish stronger
connections neurons involved generating memory
behavior quickly. that? Well, order answer
look beautiful work James McGaugh Larry Cahill. James McGaugh
Larry Cahill number experiments several decades really based lot
animal literature, mainly focused humans really established required
get better remembering things quickly. want talk one
experiment particularly important. will provide link
paper, years old now, results still hold up. fact, results
established entire field memory neuroscience psychology.
human subjects come laboratory read short paragraph
12 sentences. key thing subjects read paragraph
pretty mundane. content, information within paragraph related
content previous sentence. cogent paragraph. Right, just wasn't
meaningless scramble words. described kind mundane set
circumstances. Maybe story someone walked room, sat
desk, wrote little bit, got lunch. know, just kind
mundane information. Not interesting. Another group subjects read also 12
sentence paragraph. paragraph included subset sentences lot


emotionally intense language. language evoke emotionally
intense response person reading it. might talked car accident
intense surgery. also positive stuff. Things like birthday party,
celebration kind. big sports win. words, two
conditions study. People either read boring paragraph, read really
emotionally laden paragraph. again, emotions either positive
negative emotions. Subjects left laboratory sometime later called back
laboratory say, no point experiment know
part memory experiment. Okay, don't even know reading
paragraph. came either class credit get paid. typically
things done college campuses elsewhere. come back lab
get pop quiz. asked recall content paragraph
read previously. Now probably expected, perhaps even obvious
you, subjects read emotionally intense paragraph remembered far
content paragraph far accurate remembering
information. Now, particular finding wasn't novel. Many people previously
described emotionally intense events better remembered non-emotionally
intense events. fact, way back 1600s Francis Bacon, largely credited
developing scientific method, said, quote, memory assisted anything
makes impression powerful passion. Inspiring fear, example, wonder,
shame, joy.

00:41:42 Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline

Francis Bacon said 1620. Jim McGaugh Larry Cahill certainly not
first demonstrate conceive idea emotionally laden experiences
easily remembered experiences. However, next
immensely important understanding memory building tools
enhance learning memory. evaluated capacity stress
particular neuro chemicals associated stress improve ability learn
information. Not just information emotional, information kinds.
going describe experiments done animal models just briefly,
experiments done humans subjects. McGaugh worked mainly animals,
also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively human subjects. take


rat mouse put arena one location animal receives
electrical shock come back next day, remove shock evoking
device let animal move around arena, animal will, quite
understandably, avoid location shocked. called conditioned place
aversion. affect avoiding particular location occurs one trial. good
example one trial learning. somehow animal knows shocked
location, remembers that. hippocampal dependent learning. animals lack
hippocampus hippocampus pharmacologically otherwise
incapacitated, will not learn new bit information. animals do,
remember first time every time. Unless, block release
certain chemicals brain body chemicals referring
epinephrine, adrenaline, extent corticosterones. Things like cortisol.
Now know effect getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine,
least particular experimental scenario. researchers exact
experiment, done exact experiment, introduce
pharmacological blocker epinephrine, epinephrine released response
shock, cannot actually bind receptors biological effects,
well animal perfectly happy tread back area received
shock. almost didn't know, assume, didn't remember
received shock location. seems pretty obvious hear it.
Something bad happens location, don't go back location.
condition place avoidance. turns opposite also true. Meaning
something called condition place preference can take animal, put arena,
feed reward one location arena. can give hungry rat
mouse food one particular location, take animal out, come back next day.
No food introduced, will go back location received food.
can variant this. can make arena little bit chilly provide
warmth location. can take male animal. turns male rats
mice will mate point. female animal particular called receptive
phase mating cycle give opportunity mate give location,
go back location wait away. perhaps people go back
bar, seat bar, restaurant wait one time they,
know, things worked them. Whatever context was. Condition place
preference. Condition place preference condition place avoidance depends


release adrenaline, right. not just stress. heightened
emotional state brain body. Okay, really important. not just
stress. can get one trial learning positive events, condition place preference.
can get one trial learning negative events. say positive negative,
putting called valence it. Making value judgment whether not
animal liked didn't like it. presume animal liked didn't like
felt. turns true humans well. know
McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning
episode immediately after? Well, ingest something drinking take
capsule form, period time gets absorbed body.
different substances, caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc absorbed gut
blood stream reach brain trigger affects brain body
different rates. not instantaneous. effects within minutes, others
within tens minutes on. really going depend pharmacology
things also going depend whether not food gut,
else happen circulating blood stream, etc. basic
level can confidently say not one, not dozens, mentioned
before, hundreds studies animals humans point fact triggering
increase adrenaline late learning immediately learning going
beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize
enhance improve memory, data McGaugh Cahill many
laboratories stemmed initial work really point fact ideal
protocol focus thing trying learn intensely. also
things like error rates, etc. Please see episodes learning.
newsletter learn better. can access HubermanLab.com. zero
cost newsletter. can grab PDF. lists things learning
about. Still try get excellent sleep. Again, fundamentally important mental health,
physical health, performance. can now extend performance saying
including learning memory. Nap doesn't interrupt nighttime sleep. Naps
anywhere 10 90 minutes. non-sleep deep rest protocols will enhance learning
memory, can now add that, spiking adrenaline provided can
done safe way, going reduce number repetitions required learn.
done tail end immediately learning about.
compatible protocols mentioned. reason revisiting
stuff sleep non-sleep deep rest think people got impression
need immediately learning today saying contrary.
Immediately learning need go heightened state emotionality
alertness. Now vitally important point not need pharmacology.
don't need caffeine. don't need Alpha GPC. don't need pharmacologic
substance spike adrenaline unless something already doing.
can safely. know can safely. always say, say
again, not physician not prescribing anything. professor, profess
things. need safe you. somebody not used
drinking caffeine suddenly drink four espresso trying learn something,


going severe increase alertness probably even anxiety.
panic attack prone, please don't start taking stimulants order learn things better.
Please safe. don't just say protect me, say protect you.
mention not accustomed taking something, always want first
check doctor, course,

01:04:48 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Deliberate Cold Exposure, Adrenaline

also move gradually, right? Start lowest effective dose. minimal
effective dose. sometimes minimal effective dose zero milligrams, nothing.
say that? Well, already talked results put people's arms
ice bath order evoke adrenaline release. welcome
want. fact, pretty low cost, zero pharmacology. least exogenous
pharmacology way approach whole thing. way evoking
natural epinephrine turns also dopamine release. take cold shower.
ice bath get cold circulating bath. done several episodes
utility cold health performance. can find episodes
HubermanLab.com. Also episode colleague Stanford biology
department, Dr. Craig Heller. Lots protocols, particular episode cold
health performance. describe best use cold shower ice bath
circulating cold bath order evoke epinephrine dopamine release.
point time want protocols after, ideally
immediately learning about. Meaning sitting learn new
information trying learn new physical skill. Now whether not
compatible reasons deliberate cold exposure, whether
not compatible things doing, depends contour
lifestyle, training, academic goals, learning goals, etc.
specific purpose enhance learning memory, want spike adrenaline
afterwards. telling can caffeine. can
Alpha GPC. can combination caffeine Alpha GPC.
can safely. know using forms pharmacology.
long episode ADHD. just really declare stance clearly
not fan, actually opposed people using prescription drugs not
prescribed drugs order enhance alertness. think big addictive


potential. also potential really disrupt one's pharmacology around
dopaminergic system. However, know prescribed things like ritalin,
Adderall modafinil things sort order increase alertness focus.
prescribed things board certified physician,
going decide going take trying learn
trying learn. also take consideration drugs
long acting. shorter acting. time according trying

doesn't involve pharmacology. Second all, can generally access low zero
cost, especially cold shower approach. third, can titrate it. can start
warmer water. can make very, cold thing able
tolerate safely. can make moderately cold. cold order
invoke adrenaline release? Well, uncomfortably cold cold enough
feel like really want get out, can stay safely. going evoke
adrenaline release. quickens breathing, makes go wide eyed.
increasing adrenaline release. fact, effects going wide eyed quickening
breathing challenges thinking clearly, direct effects
adrenaline brain body. course, ways increase
adrenaline. go hard run. number things
increase adrenaline body. things choose you,
clear, solid grounding research data, can confidently say spiking
adrenaline interacting material, physical cognitive material

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data
epinephrine release, better people remembered material.

language, learning passage words, learning mathematics. whether not
physical learning. want emphasize something physical learning
know number probably drinking cup coffee cup yerba
mate maybe even energy drink taking Alpha GPC something
physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work
matter, guest. think perfectly fine, provided safe you.
moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

seahorse. either reflects lack understanding seahorse really looks
like, visual deficit, think fair say anatomists using little bit
creative elaboration thinking hippocampus looks like. Nonetheless,
curved structure. many layers. described colleague Robert
Sapolsky others looking like jelly roll cinnamon roll, looks
like me. take one cinnamon roll, chop middle. now
got two half cinnamon rolls rather put back together
configuration before, just slide one got essentially two
C's. Two C-shaped halves cinnamon roll push together, right,
slightly off set one another. Well, hippocampus looks like me.
think far better description actual physical structure. guess
use physical structure name, well open brain
atlas called two half-C cinnamon rolls stuffed halfway together.
not good. guess, seahorse will work. Hippocampus name

important interesting twists HM not terms learning
memory teach us lot brain. fact, think neuroscientists
agree unfortunate case HM's epilepsy subsequent neuro
surgery taught us much know, least think about, terms
human learning memory. instance, mentioned before, still implicit
knowledge. knew walk. knew certain things like make cup
coffee. knew names people met much earlier life, on.
yet couldn't form new memories. Now, violation last statement,
elements HM's emotionality suggests sort
residual capacity learn new information wasn't normally think
explicit declarative procedural memory. instance, reported
said, say, don't know studies ever done intense
physiological measurements, tell HM joke, thought
funny, laugh really hard. liked jokes, say hey, HM, want tell
joke. tell joke laugh really hard. leave
room, come back, tell joke again. Now keep mind, not
remember told joke previously. second time laugh
little bit less. leave room, come back again. Say hi, Andrew.
say, oh, nice meet you. know, recall, can
recall things. couldn't recall things. didn't know just met you.
least couldn't remember it. tell joke third time, fourth time,
subsequent telling joke found little less funny. Just as, keep
mind, folks, tell joke get big laugh, don't tell again. least not
immediately. Not person crowd second time
little less funny third time little less funny. actually
whole element dopamine relationship surprise. topic
future podcast talk humor novelty brain. point


certain forms memory seem exist kind phantom like way within
HM's brain. mean that? Well, underscores implicit
memory heard joke before. suggests humor, least
find funny, somehow related procedures. Similar walking motor ability
precise content joke. right, little bit abstract
concept, point HM lacked explicit declarative memory. couldn't tell
just heard. not learn new information. couldn't tell
something unless learned something many years prior. Now,
lot patients besides HM brain lesions due
epilepsy, say due surgeries treat epilepsy, due strokes, due sadly
gunshot wounds forms call infarcts, infarct. I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct
word use describe damage particular brain region. many different

aspects brain work. HM really teaches us know
able consequence things aware learnings
passed off subconscious knowledge, body knows. brain
knows, don't know exactly know thing. tell story
HM's ability understand joke, repeated telling joke less
less less impact creating sense laughter, humor HM. Not just

can enhance memories even memories things not
funny, not intensely sad, not immensely happy don't evoke really strong
emotional response, even emotional response. reason

look beautiful work James McGaugh Larry Cahill. James McGaugh
Larry Cahill number experiments several decades really based lot
animal literature, mainly focused humans really established required
get better remembering things quickly. want talk one
experiment particularly important. will provide link
paper, years old now, results still hold up. fact, results
established entire field memory neuroscience psychology.
human subjects come laboratory read short paragraph
12 sentences. key thing subjects read paragraph
pretty mundane. content, information within paragraph related
content previous sentence. cogent paragraph. Right, just wasn't
meaningless scramble words. described kind mundane set
circumstances. Maybe story someone walked room, sat
desk, wrote little bit, got lunch. know, just kind
mundane information. Not interesting. Another group subjects read also 12
sentence paragraph. paragraph included subset sentences lot


emotionally intense language. language evoke emotionally
intense response person reading it. might talked car accident
intense surgery. also positive stuff. Things like birthday party,
celebration kind. big sports win. words, two
conditions study. People either read boring paragraph, read really
emotionally laden paragraph. again, emotions either positive
negative emotions. Subjects left laboratory sometime later called back
laboratory say, no point experiment know
part memory experiment. Okay, don't even know reading
paragraph. came either class credit get paid. typically
things done college campuses elsewhere. come back lab
get pop quiz. asked recall content paragraph
read previously. Now probably expected, perhaps even obvious
you, subjects read emotionally intense paragraph remembered far
content paragraph far accurate remembering
information. Now, particular finding wasn't novel. Many people previously
described emotionally intense events better remembered non-emotionally
intense events. fact, way back 1600s Francis Bacon, largely credited
developing scientific method, said, quote, memory assisted anything
makes impression powerful passion. Inspiring fear, example, wonder,
shame, joy.

00:41:42 Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline

Francis Bacon said 1620. Jim McGaugh Larry Cahill certainly not
first demonstrate conceive idea emotionally laden experiences
easily remembered experiences. However, next
immensely important understanding memory building tools
enhance learning memory. evaluated capacity stress
particular neuro chemicals associated stress improve ability learn
information. Not just information emotional, information kinds.
going describe experiments done animal models just briefly,
experiments done humans subjects. McGaugh worked mainly animals,
also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively human subjects. take


rat mouse put arena one location animal receives
electrical shock come back next day, remove shock evoking
device let animal move around arena, animal will, quite
understandably, avoid location shocked. called conditioned place
aversion. affect avoiding particular location occurs one trial. good
example one trial learning. somehow animal knows shocked
location, remembers that. hippocampal dependent learning. animals lack
hippocampus hippocampus pharmacologically otherwise
incapacitated, will not learn new bit information. animals do,
remember first time every time. Unless, block release
certain chemicals brain body chemicals referring
epinephrine, adrenaline, extent corticosterones. Things like cortisol.
Now know effect getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine,
least particular experimental scenario. researchers exact
experiment, done exact experiment, introduce
pharmacological blocker epinephrine, epinephrine released response
shock, cannot actually bind receptors biological effects,
well animal perfectly happy tread back area received
shock. almost didn't know, assume, didn't remember
received shock location. seems pretty obvious hear it.
Something bad happens location, don't go back location.
condition place avoidance. turns opposite also true. Meaning
something called condition place preference can take animal, put arena,
feed reward one location arena. can give hungry rat
mouse food one particular location, take animal out, come back next day.
No food introduced, will go back location received food.
can variant this. can make arena little bit chilly provide
warmth location. can take male animal. turns male rats
mice will mate point. female animal particular called receptive
phase mating cycle give opportunity mate give location,
go back location wait away. perhaps people go back
bar, seat bar, restaurant wait one time they,
know, things worked them. Whatever context was. Condition place
preference. Condition place preference condition place avoidance depends


release adrenaline, right. not just stress. heightened
emotional state brain body. Okay, really important. not just
stress. can get one trial learning positive events, condition place preference.
can get one trial learning negative events. say positive negative,
putting called valence it. Making value judgment whether not
animal liked didn't like it. presume animal liked didn't like
felt. turns true humans well. know
McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning
episode immediately after? Well, ingest something drinking take
capsule form, period time gets absorbed body.
different substances, caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc absorbed gut
blood stream reach brain trigger affects brain body
different rates. not instantaneous. effects within minutes, others
within tens minutes on. really going depend pharmacology
things also going depend whether not food gut,
else happen circulating blood stream, etc. basic
level can confidently say not one, not dozens, mentioned
before, hundreds studies animals humans point fact triggering
increase adrenaline late learning immediately learning going
beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize
enhance improve memory, data McGaugh Cahill many
laboratories stemmed initial work really point fact ideal
protocol focus thing trying learn intensely. also
things like error rates, etc. Please see episodes learning.
newsletter learn better. can access HubermanLab.com. zero
cost newsletter. can grab PDF. lists things learning
about. Still try get excellent sleep. Again, fundamentally important mental health,
physical health, performance. can now extend performance saying
including learning memory. Nap doesn't interrupt nighttime sleep. Naps
anywhere 10 90 minutes. non-sleep deep rest protocols will enhance learning
memory, can now add that, spiking adrenaline provided can
done safe way, going reduce number repetitions required learn.
done tail end immediately learning about.
compatible protocols mentioned. reason revisiting
stuff sleep non-sleep deep rest think people got impression
need immediately learning today saying contrary.
Immediately learning need go heightened state emotionality
alertness. Now vitally important point not need pharmacology.
don't need caffeine. don't need Alpha GPC. don't need pharmacologic
substance spike adrenaline unless something already doing.
can safely. know can safely. always say, say
again, not physician not prescribing anything. professor, profess
things. need safe you. somebody not used
drinking caffeine suddenly drink four espresso trying learn something,


going severe increase alertness probably even anxiety.

check doctor, course,

01:04:48 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Deliberate Cold Exposure, Adrenaline

also move gradually, right? Start lowest effective dose. minimal
effective dose. sometimes minimal effective dose zero milligrams, nothing.
say that? Well, already talked results put people's arms

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning

numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab

lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons

landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult

minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

petite mal seizures, minor seizures. can tonic clonic seizures,
sometimes not even detectable. can absent seizures people
will just stop, almost brain kind goes pause just stop there.
reported actually Einstein absent seizures. Although don't know
ever really confirmed neurologically. Grand mal seizures extremely severe
HM had. just going day maybe even cooking,
something, driving, operating kind machinery, sudden
just drop seizure. just physically drop go grand
mal seizure. convulsing whole body, loss consciousness, etc.
feel coming on. Often times people epilepsy can feel epileptic seizure coming
on. Kind like wave back brain. sometimes can get safe
circumstance, not always. frequency intensity seizures
robust neurosurgeons neurologists decided needed
locate origin, call foci seizures, remove brain tissue.
way seizures work spread focus, foci brain
tissue. unfortunately HM, focus seizures hippocampus.
lot deliberation, neurosurgeon, fact one famous neurosurgeons
world time, made called electrolytic lesions, actually burned
hippocampus brain HM. consequence, lost explicit memory.
Now consequence couldn't exist normal, everyday life, like
people. live mostly, not entirely, mostly kind hospital
setting. talked several people, say, met HM directly,
no longer alive. interaction might look like following.
walk just fine. wouldn't know kind brain damage.
walk fine, speak fine. say, hi, Andrew. say, hi,
whatever name happened be. wouldn't say HM, probably say
real name. perhaps someone new walk room. might turn
around, look person, us might do. turn around back
say, hi, name? say, well, just told name.
just told name, remember that? say, sorry, don't
remember that. name? go again.
complete lack explicit declarative memory. Now memory
previous events life dated way back, okay. Again, hinting idea
memories not necessarily stored hippocampus, just formed


hippocampus. moved hippocampus brain areas,
still keep memories. different database, will.
different pattern firing

00:31:49 Emotion & Memory Enhancement

neural circuits. couldn't form new memories. Now
important interesting twists HM not terms learning
memory teach us lot brain. fact, think neuroscientists
agree unfortunate case HM's epilepsy subsequent neuro
surgery taught us much know, least think about, terms
human learning memory. instance, mentioned before, still implicit
knowledge. knew walk. knew certain things like make cup
coffee. knew names people met much earlier life, on.
yet couldn't form new memories. Now, violation last statement,
elements HM's emotionality suggests sort
residual capacity learn new information wasn't normally think
explicit declarative procedural memory. instance, reported
said, say, don't know studies ever done intense
physiological measurements, tell HM joke, thought
funny, laugh really hard. liked jokes, say hey, HM, want tell
joke. tell joke laugh really hard. leave
room, come back, tell joke again. Now keep mind, not
remember told joke previously. second time laugh
little bit less. leave room, come back again. Say hi, Andrew.
say, oh, nice meet you. know, recall, can
recall things. couldn't recall things. didn't know just met you.
least couldn't remember it. tell joke third time, fourth time,
subsequent telling joke found little less funny. Just as, keep
mind, folks, tell joke get big laugh, don't tell again. least not
immediately. Not person crowd second time
little less funny third time little less funny. actually
whole element dopamine relationship surprise. topic
future podcast talk humor novelty brain. point


certain forms memory seem exist kind phantom like way within
HM's brain. mean that? Well, underscores implicit
memory heard joke before. suggests humor, least
find funny, somehow related procedures. Similar walking motor ability
precise content joke. right, little bit abstract
concept, point HM lacked explicit declarative memory. couldn't tell
just heard. not learn new information. couldn't tell
something unless learned something many years prior. Now,
lot patients besides HM brain lesions due
epilepsy, say due surgeries treat epilepsy, due strokes, due sadly
gunshot wounds forms call infarcts, infarct. I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct
word use describe damage particular brain region. many different
patients many different patterns infarct taught us lot memory
aspects brain work. HM really teaches us know
able consequence things aware learnings
passed off subconscious knowledge, body knows. brain
knows, don't know exactly know thing. tell story
HM's ability understand joke, repeated telling joke less
less less impact creating sense laughter, humor HM. Not just
anecdote flesh story, emotion turns way
can enhance memories even memories things not
funny, not intensely sad, not immensely happy don't evoke really strong
emotional response, even emotional response. reason
emotions, just like perception, just like sensation, consequence particular
neuro chemicals present brain body. going tell next,
particular neuro chemicals can leverage order learn specific
information faster remember much longer period time, maybe even
forever. can leveraging relationship nervous system

00:36:44 Tool: Emotion Saliency & Improved Memory

brain body. body back brain. talk
tools enhancing memory. Now one tool absolutely clear works.
always worked, works now, will work forever. repetition.


often perform something recite something, likely
remember future. might seem obvious, worth thinking
happening repeat something. say happening, mean
neural level. happening encouraging firing particular
chains neurons reside particular circuit, right. particular sequence
neurons playing neuron A, B, C, D played particular sequence
again. repetitions, get strengthening nerve
connections. Now, repetition works problem people either don't
patience, don't time, sometimes literally don't
time got deadline something trying remember
learn. simply like able remember things better general
remember quickly. process accelerating repetition based learning
learning curve doesn't go perform something 1,000 times
gradually time 1,000, 750 times day, 500 times day, 300 times day,
no repetitions, right? can just perform thing first time every
time. Well, way shift curve can essentially establish stronger
connections neurons involved generating memory
behavior quickly. that? Well, order answer
look beautiful work James McGaugh Larry Cahill. James McGaugh
Larry Cahill number experiments several decades really based lot
animal literature, mainly focused humans really established required
get better remembering things quickly. want talk one
experiment particularly important. will provide link
paper, years old now, results still hold up. fact, results
established entire field memory neuroscience psychology.
human subjects come laboratory read short paragraph
12 sentences. key thing subjects read paragraph
pretty mundane. content, information within paragraph related
content previous sentence. cogent paragraph. Right, just wasn't
meaningless scramble words. described kind mundane set
circumstances. Maybe story someone walked room, sat
desk, wrote little bit, got lunch. know, just kind
mundane information. Not interesting. Another group subjects read also 12
sentence paragraph. paragraph included subset sentences lot


emotionally intense language. language evoke emotionally
intense response person reading it. might talked car accident
intense surgery. also positive stuff. Things like birthday party,
celebration kind. big sports win. words, two
conditions study. People either read boring paragraph, read really
emotionally laden paragraph. again, emotions either positive
negative emotions. Subjects left laboratory sometime later called back
laboratory say, no point experiment know
part memory experiment. Okay, don't even know reading
paragraph. came either class credit get paid. typically
things done college campuses elsewhere. come back lab
get pop quiz. asked recall content paragraph
read previously. Now probably expected, perhaps even obvious
you, subjects read emotionally intense paragraph remembered far
content paragraph far accurate remembering
information. Now, particular finding wasn't novel. Many people previously
described emotionally intense events better remembered non-emotionally
intense events. fact, way back 1600s Francis Bacon, largely credited
developing scientific method, said, quote, memory assisted anything

shame, joy.

00:41:42 Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline

Francis Bacon said 1620. Jim McGaugh Larry Cahill certainly not
first demonstrate conceive idea emotionally laden experiences
easily remembered experiences. However, next
immensely important understanding memory building tools
enhance learning memory. evaluated capacity stress
particular neuro chemicals associated stress improve ability learn
information. Not just information emotional, information kinds.
going describe experiments done animal models just briefly,
experiments done humans subjects. McGaugh worked mainly animals,
also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively human subjects. take


rat mouse put arena one location animal receives
electrical shock come back next day, remove shock evoking
device let animal move around arena, animal will, quite
understandably, avoid location shocked. called conditioned place
aversion. affect avoiding particular location occurs one trial. good
example one trial learning. somehow animal knows shocked
location, remembers that. hippocampal dependent learning. animals lack
hippocampus hippocampus pharmacologically otherwise
incapacitated, will not learn new bit information. animals do,
remember first time every time. Unless, block release
certain chemicals brain body chemicals referring
epinephrine, adrenaline, extent corticosterones. Things like cortisol.
Now know effect getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine,
least particular experimental scenario. researchers exact
experiment, done exact experiment, introduce
pharmacological blocker epinephrine, epinephrine released response
shock, cannot actually bind receptors biological effects,
well animal perfectly happy tread back area received
shock. almost didn't know, assume, didn't remember
received shock location. seems pretty obvious hear it.
Something bad happens location, don't go back location.
condition place avoidance. turns opposite also true. Meaning
something called condition place preference can take animal, put arena,
feed reward one location arena. can give hungry rat
mouse food one particular location, take animal out, come back next day.
No food introduced, will go back location received food.
can variant this. can make arena little bit chilly provide
warmth location. can take male animal. turns male rats
mice will mate point. female animal particular called receptive
phase mating cycle give opportunity mate give location,
go back location wait away. perhaps people go back
bar, seat bar, restaurant wait one time they,
know, things worked them. Whatever context was. Condition place
preference. Condition place preference condition place avoidance depends


release adrenaline, right. not just stress. heightened
emotional state brain body. Okay, really important. not just
stress. can get one trial learning positive events, condition place preference.
can get one trial learning negative events. say positive negative,
putting called valence it. Making value judgment whether not
animal liked didn't like it. presume animal liked didn't like
felt. turns true humans well. know
McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning
episode immediately after? Well, ingest something drinking take
capsule form, period time gets absorbed body.
different substances, caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc absorbed gut
blood stream reach brain trigger affects brain body
different rates. not instantaneous. effects within minutes, others
within tens minutes on. really going depend pharmacology
things also going depend whether not food gut,
else happen circulating blood stream, etc. basic
level can confidently say not one, not dozens, mentioned
before, hundreds studies animals humans point fact triggering
increase adrenaline late learning immediately learning going
beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus

difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.

recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation

rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

still keep memories. different database, will.
different pattern firing

00:31:49 Emotion & Memory Enhancement

neural circuits. couldn't form new memories. Now
important interesting twists HM not terms learning
memory teach us lot brain. fact, think neuroscientists
agree unfortunate case HM's epilepsy subsequent neuro
surgery taught us much know, least think about, terms
human learning memory. instance, mentioned before, still implicit
knowledge. knew walk. knew certain things like make cup
coffee. knew names people met much earlier life, on.
yet couldn't form new memories. Now, violation last statement,
elements HM's emotionality suggests sort
residual capacity learn new information wasn't normally think
explicit declarative procedural memory. instance, reported
said, say, don't know studies ever done intense
physiological measurements, tell HM joke, thought
funny, laugh really hard. liked jokes, say hey, HM, want tell
joke. tell joke laugh really hard. leave
room, come back, tell joke again. Now keep mind, not
remember told joke previously. second time laugh
little bit less. leave room, come back again. Say hi, Andrew.
say, oh, nice meet you. know, recall, can
recall things. couldn't recall things. didn't know just met you.
least couldn't remember it. tell joke third time, fourth time,
subsequent telling joke found little less funny. Just as, keep
mind, folks, tell joke get big laugh, don't tell again. least not
immediately. Not person crowd second time
little less funny third time little less funny. actually
whole element dopamine relationship surprise. topic
future podcast talk humor novelty brain. point


certain forms memory seem exist kind phantom like way within
HM's brain. mean that? Well, underscores implicit
memory heard joke before. suggests humor, least
find funny, somehow related procedures. Similar walking motor ability
precise content joke. right, little bit abstract
concept, point HM lacked explicit declarative memory. couldn't tell
just heard. not learn new information. couldn't tell
something unless learned something many years prior. Now,
lot patients besides HM brain lesions due
epilepsy, say due surgeries treat epilepsy, due strokes, due sadly
gunshot wounds forms call infarcts, infarct. I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct
word use describe damage particular brain region. many different
patients many different patterns infarct taught us lot memory
aspects brain work. HM really teaches us know
able consequence things aware learnings
passed off subconscious knowledge, body knows. brain
knows, don't know exactly know thing. tell story
HM's ability understand joke, repeated telling joke less
less less impact creating sense laughter, humor HM. Not just
anecdote flesh story, emotion turns way
can enhance memories even memories things not
funny, not intensely sad, not immensely happy don't evoke really strong
emotional response, even emotional response. reason
emotions, just like perception, just like sensation, consequence particular
neuro chemicals present brain body. going tell next,
particular neuro chemicals can leverage order learn specific
information faster remember much longer period time, maybe even
forever. can leveraging relationship nervous system

00:36:44 Tool: Emotion Saliency & Improved Memory

brain body. body back brain. talk
tools enhancing memory. Now one tool absolutely clear works.
always worked, works now, will work forever. repetition.


often perform something recite something, likely
remember future. might seem obvious, worth thinking
happening repeat something. say happening, mean
neural level. happening encouraging firing particular
chains neurons reside particular circuit, right. particular sequence
neurons playing neuron A, B, C, D played particular sequence
again. repetitions, get strengthening nerve
connections. Now, repetition works problem people either don't
patience, don't time, sometimes literally don't
time got deadline something trying remember
learn. simply like able remember things better general
remember quickly. process accelerating repetition based learning
learning curve doesn't go perform something 1,000 times
gradually time 1,000, 750 times day, 500 times day, 300 times day,
no repetitions, right? can just perform thing first time every
time. Well, way shift curve can essentially establish stronger
connections neurons involved generating memory
behavior quickly. that? Well, order answer
look beautiful work James McGaugh Larry Cahill. James McGaugh
Larry Cahill number experiments several decades really based lot
animal literature, mainly focused humans really established required
get better remembering things quickly. want talk one
experiment particularly important. will provide link
paper, years old now, results still hold up. fact, results
established entire field memory neuroscience psychology.
human subjects come laboratory read short paragraph
12 sentences. key thing subjects read paragraph
pretty mundane. content, information within paragraph related
content previous sentence. cogent paragraph. Right, just wasn't
meaningless scramble words. described kind mundane set
circumstances. Maybe story someone walked room, sat
desk, wrote little bit, got lunch. know, just kind
mundane information. Not interesting. Another group subjects read also 12
sentence paragraph. paragraph included subset sentences lot


emotionally intense language. language evoke emotionally
intense response person reading it. might talked car accident
intense surgery. also positive stuff. Things like birthday party,
celebration kind. big sports win. words, two
conditions study. People either read boring paragraph, read really
emotionally laden paragraph. again, emotions either positive
negative emotions. Subjects left laboratory sometime later called back
laboratory say, no point experiment know
part memory experiment. Okay, don't even know reading
paragraph. came either class credit get paid. typically
things done college campuses elsewhere. come back lab
get pop quiz. asked recall content paragraph
read previously. Now probably expected, perhaps even obvious
you, subjects read emotionally intense paragraph remembered far
content paragraph far accurate remembering
information. Now, particular finding wasn't novel. Many people previously
described emotionally intense events better remembered non-emotionally
intense events. fact, way back 1600s Francis Bacon, largely credited
developing scientific method, said, quote, memory assisted anything
makes impression powerful passion. Inspiring fear, example, wonder,
shame, joy.

00:41:42 Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline

Francis Bacon said 1620. Jim McGaugh Larry Cahill certainly not
first demonstrate conceive idea emotionally laden experiences
easily remembered experiences. However, next
immensely important understanding memory building tools
enhance learning memory. evaluated capacity stress
particular neuro chemicals associated stress improve ability learn
information. Not just information emotional, information kinds.
going describe experiments done animal models just briefly,
experiments done humans subjects. McGaugh worked mainly animals,
also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively human subjects. take


rat mouse put arena one location animal receives
electrical shock come back next day, remove shock evoking
device let animal move around arena, animal will, quite
understandably, avoid location shocked. called conditioned place
aversion. affect avoiding particular location occurs one trial. good
example one trial learning. somehow animal knows shocked
location, remembers that. hippocampal dependent learning. animals lack
hippocampus hippocampus pharmacologically otherwise
incapacitated, will not learn new bit information. animals do,
remember first time every time. Unless, block release
certain chemicals brain body chemicals referring
epinephrine, adrenaline, extent corticosterones. Things like cortisol.
Now know effect getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine,
least particular experimental scenario. researchers exact
experiment, done exact experiment, introduce
pharmacological blocker epinephrine, epinephrine released response
shock, cannot actually bind receptors biological effects,
well animal perfectly happy tread back area received
shock. almost didn't know, assume, didn't remember
received shock location. seems pretty obvious hear it.
Something bad happens location, don't go back location.
condition place avoidance. turns opposite also true. Meaning
something called condition place preference can take animal, put arena,
feed reward one location arena. can give hungry rat
mouse food one particular location, take animal out, come back next day.
No food introduced, will go back location received food.
can variant this. can make arena little bit chilly provide
warmth location. can take male animal. turns male rats
mice will mate point. female animal particular called receptive
phase mating cycle give opportunity mate give location,
go back location wait away. perhaps people go back
bar, seat bar, restaurant wait one time they,
know, things worked them. Whatever context was. Condition place
preference. Condition place preference condition place avoidance depends


release adrenaline, right. not just stress. heightened
emotional state brain body. Okay, really important. not just
stress. can get one trial learning positive events, condition place preference.
can get one trial learning negative events. say positive negative,
putting called valence it. Making value judgment whether not
animal liked didn't like it. presume animal liked didn't like
felt. turns true humans well. know
McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing

motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing

body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start
become afraid entire city blocks one bad thing happened particular room
particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise

really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer

affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise

cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human

certain forms memory seem exist kind phantom like way within
HM's brain. mean that? Well, underscores implicit

find funny, somehow related procedures. Similar walking motor ability
precise content joke. right, little bit abstract
concept, point HM lacked explicit declarative memory. couldn't tell
just heard. not learn new information. couldn't tell

00:36:44 Tool: Emotion Saliency & Improved Memory

brain body. body back brain. talk
tools enhancing memory. Now one tool absolutely clear works.
always worked, works now, will work forever. repetition.


often perform something recite something, likely
remember future. might seem obvious, worth thinking
happening repeat something. say happening, mean
neural level. happening encouraging firing particular
chains neurons reside particular circuit, right. particular sequence
neurons playing neuron A, B, C, D played particular sequence
again. repetitions, get strengthening nerve
connections. Now, repetition works problem people either don't
patience, don't time, sometimes literally don't
time got deadline something trying remember
learn. simply like able remember things better general
remember quickly. process accelerating repetition based learning
learning curve doesn't go perform something 1,000 times
gradually time 1,000, 750 times day, 500 times day, 300 times day,
no repetitions, right? can just perform thing first time every
time. Well, way shift curve can essentially establish stronger
connections neurons involved generating memory
behavior quickly. that? Well, order answer
look beautiful work James McGaugh Larry Cahill. James McGaugh
Larry Cahill number experiments several decades really based lot
animal literature, mainly focused humans really established required
get better remembering things quickly. want talk one
experiment particularly important. will provide link
paper, years old now, results still hold up. fact, results
established entire field memory neuroscience psychology.
human subjects come laboratory read short paragraph
12 sentences. key thing subjects read paragraph
pretty mundane. content, information within paragraph related
content previous sentence. cogent paragraph. Right, just wasn't
meaningless scramble words. described kind mundane set
circumstances. Maybe story someone walked room, sat
desk, wrote little bit, got lunch. know, just kind
mundane information. Not interesting. Another group subjects read also 12
sentence paragraph. paragraph included subset sentences lot


emotionally intense language. language evoke emotionally
intense response person reading it. might talked car accident
intense surgery. also positive stuff. Things like birthday party,
celebration kind. big sports win. words, two
conditions study. People either read boring paragraph, read really
emotionally laden paragraph. again, emotions either positive
negative emotions. Subjects left laboratory sometime later called back
laboratory say, no point experiment know
part memory experiment. Okay, don't even know reading
paragraph. came either class credit get paid. typically
things done college campuses elsewhere. come back lab
get pop quiz. asked recall content paragraph
read previously. Now probably expected, perhaps even obvious
you, subjects read emotionally intense paragraph remembered far
content paragraph far accurate remembering
information. Now, particular finding wasn't novel. Many people previously
described emotionally intense events better remembered non-emotionally
intense events. fact, way back 1600s Francis Bacon, largely credited
developing scientific method, said, quote, memory assisted anything
makes impression powerful passion. Inspiring fear, example, wonder,
shame, joy.

00:41:42 Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline

Francis Bacon said 1620. Jim McGaugh Larry Cahill certainly not
first demonstrate conceive idea emotionally laden experiences
easily remembered experiences. However, next
immensely important understanding memory building tools
enhance learning memory. evaluated capacity stress
particular neuro chemicals associated stress improve ability learn
information. Not just information emotional, information kinds.
going describe experiments done animal models just briefly,
experiments done humans subjects. McGaugh worked mainly animals,
also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively human subjects. take


rat mouse put arena one location animal receives
electrical shock come back next day, remove shock evoking
device let animal move around arena, animal will, quite
understandably, avoid location shocked. called conditioned place
aversion. affect avoiding particular location occurs one trial. good
example one trial learning. somehow animal knows shocked
location, remembers that. hippocampal dependent learning. animals lack
hippocampus hippocampus pharmacologically otherwise
incapacitated, will not learn new bit information. animals do,
remember first time every time. Unless, block release
certain chemicals brain body chemicals referring
epinephrine, adrenaline, extent corticosterones. Things like cortisol.
Now know effect getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine,
least particular experimental scenario. researchers exact
experiment, done exact experiment, introduce
pharmacological blocker epinephrine, epinephrine released response
shock, cannot actually bind receptors biological effects,
well animal perfectly happy tread back area received
shock. almost didn't know, assume, didn't remember
received shock location. seems pretty obvious hear it.
Something bad happens location, don't go back location.
condition place avoidance. turns opposite also true. Meaning
something called condition place preference can take animal, put arena,
feed reward one location arena. can give hungry rat
mouse food one particular location, take animal out, come back next day.
No food introduced, will go back location received food.
can variant this. can make arena little bit chilly provide
warmth location. can take male animal. turns male rats
mice will mate point. female animal particular called receptive
phase mating cycle give opportunity mate give location,
go back location wait away. perhaps people go back
bar, seat bar, restaurant wait one time they,
know, things worked them. Whatever context was. Condition place
preference. Condition place preference condition place avoidance depends


release adrenaline, right. not just stress. heightened
emotional state brain body. Okay, really important. not just
stress. can get one trial learning positive events, condition place preference.
can get one trial learning negative events. say positive negative,
putting called valence it. Making value judgment whether not
animal liked didn't like it. presume animal liked didn't like
felt. turns true humans well. know
McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning
episode immediately after? Well, ingest something drinking take
capsule form, period time gets absorbed body.
different substances, caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc absorbed gut
blood stream reach brain trigger affects brain body
different rates. not instantaneous. effects within minutes, others
within tens minutes on. really going depend pharmacology
things also going depend whether not food gut,
else happen circulating blood stream, etc. basic
level can confidently say not one, not dozens, mentioned
before, hundreds studies animals humans point fact triggering
increase adrenaline late learning immediately learning going
beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize
enhance improve memory, data McGaugh Cahill many
laboratories stemmed initial work really point fact ideal
protocol focus thing trying learn intensely. also
things like error rates, etc. Please see episodes learning.
newsletter learn better. can access HubermanLab.com. zero
cost newsletter. can grab PDF. lists things learning
about. Still try get excellent sleep. Again, fundamentally important mental health,
physical health, performance. can now extend performance saying
including learning memory. Nap doesn't interrupt nighttime sleep. Naps
anywhere 10 90 minutes. non-sleep deep rest protocols will enhance learning
memory, can now add that, spiking adrenaline provided can
done safe way, going reduce number repetitions required learn.
done tail end immediately learning about.
compatible protocols mentioned. reason revisiting
stuff sleep non-sleep deep rest think people got impression
need immediately learning today saying contrary.
Immediately learning need go heightened state emotionality
alertness. Now vitally important point not need pharmacology.
don't need caffeine. don't need Alpha GPC. don't need pharmacologic
substance spike adrenaline unless something already doing.
can safely. know can safely. always say, say
again, not physician not prescribing anything. professor, profess
things. need safe you. somebody not used
drinking caffeine suddenly drink four espresso trying learn something,


going severe increase alertness probably even anxiety.
panic attack prone, please don't start taking stimulants order learn things better.
Please safe. don't just say protect me, say protect you.
mention not accustomed taking something, always want first
check doctor, course,

01:04:48 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Deliberate Cold Exposure, Adrenaline

also move gradually, right? Start lowest effective dose. minimal
effective dose. sometimes minimal effective dose zero milligrams, nothing.
say that? Well, already talked results put people's arms
ice bath order evoke adrenaline release. welcome
want. fact, pretty low cost, zero pharmacology. least exogenous
pharmacology way approach whole thing. way evoking
natural epinephrine turns also dopamine release. take cold shower.
ice bath get cold circulating bath. done several episodes
utility cold health performance. can find episodes
HubermanLab.com. Also episode colleague Stanford biology
department, Dr. Craig Heller. Lots protocols, particular episode cold
health performance. describe best use cold shower ice bath
circulating cold bath order evoke epinephrine dopamine release.
point time want protocols after, ideally
immediately learning about. Meaning sitting learn new
information trying learn new physical skill. Now whether not
compatible reasons deliberate cold exposure, whether
not compatible things doing, depends contour
lifestyle, training, academic goals, learning goals, etc.
specific purpose enhance learning memory, want spike adrenaline
afterwards. telling can caffeine. can
Alpha GPC. can combination caffeine Alpha GPC.
can safely. know using forms pharmacology.
long episode ADHD. just really declare stance clearly
not fan, actually opposed people using prescription drugs not
prescribed drugs order enhance alertness. think big addictive


potential. also potential really disrupt one's pharmacology around
dopaminergic system. However, know prescribed things like ritalin,
Adderall modafinil things sort order increase alertness focus.
prescribed things board certified physician,
going decide going take trying learn
trying learn. also take consideration drugs
long acting. shorter acting. time according trying
learn when. pharmacology. mentioned, behavioral
protocols. can use cold cold excellent stimulus first all,
doesn't involve pharmacology. Second all, can generally access low zero
cost, especially cold shower approach. third, can titrate it. can start
warmer water. can make very, cold thing able
tolerate safely. can make moderately cold. cold order
invoke adrenaline release? Well, uncomfortably cold cold enough
feel like really want get out, can stay safely. going evoke
adrenaline release. quickens breathing, makes go wide eyed.
increasing adrenaline release. fact, effects going wide eyed quickening
breathing challenges thinking clearly, direct effects
adrenaline brain body. course, ways increase
adrenaline. go hard run. number things
increase adrenaline body. things choose you,
clear, solid grounding research data, can confidently say spiking
adrenaline interacting material, physical cognitive material

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data
epinephrine release, better people remembered material.

physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work
matter, guest. think perfectly fine, provided safe you.
moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start
become afraid entire city blocks one bad thing happened particular room
particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise
specific nuanced every little detail. amygdala lumper
splitter comes sensory events. areas brain become
active very, specific conditions conditions. similarly,
epinephrine just molecule. just chemical circulating brain body.
no epinephrine specifically cold shower distinct epinephrine
associated bad event distinct epinephrine associated
really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

look beautiful work James McGaugh Larry Cahill. James McGaugh
Larry Cahill number experiments several decades really based lot
animal literature, mainly focused humans really established required
get better remembering things quickly. want talk one
experiment particularly important. will provide link
paper, years old now, results still hold up. fact, results
established entire field memory neuroscience psychology.
human subjects come laboratory read short paragraph
12 sentences. key thing subjects read paragraph
pretty mundane. content, information within paragraph related
content previous sentence. cogent paragraph. Right, just wasn't
meaningless scramble words. described kind mundane set
circumstances. Maybe story someone walked room, sat
desk, wrote little bit, got lunch. know, just kind
mundane information. Not interesting. Another group subjects read also 12
sentence paragraph. paragraph included subset sentences lot


emotionally intense language. language evoke emotionally
intense response person reading it. might talked car accident
intense surgery. also positive stuff. Things like birthday party,
celebration kind. big sports win. words, two
conditions study. People either read boring paragraph, read really
emotionally laden paragraph. again, emotions either positive
negative emotions. Subjects left laboratory sometime later called back
laboratory say, no point experiment know
part memory experiment. Okay, don't even know reading
paragraph. came either class credit get paid. typically
things done college campuses elsewhere. come back lab
get pop quiz. asked recall content paragraph
read previously. Now probably expected, perhaps even obvious
you, subjects read emotionally intense paragraph remembered far
content paragraph far accurate remembering
information. Now, particular finding wasn't novel. Many people previously
described emotionally intense events better remembered non-emotionally
intense events. fact, way back 1600s Francis Bacon, largely credited
developing scientific method, said, quote, memory assisted anything
makes impression powerful passion. Inspiring fear, example, wonder,
shame, joy.

00:41:42 Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline

Francis Bacon said 1620. Jim McGaugh Larry Cahill certainly not
first demonstrate conceive idea emotionally laden experiences
easily remembered experiences. However, next
immensely important understanding memory building tools
enhance learning memory. evaluated capacity stress
particular neuro chemicals associated stress improve ability learn
information. Not just information emotional, information kinds.
going describe experiments done animal models just briefly,
experiments done humans subjects. McGaugh worked mainly animals,
also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively human subjects. take


rat mouse put arena one location animal receives
electrical shock come back next day, remove shock evoking
device let animal move around arena, animal will, quite
understandably, avoid location shocked. called conditioned place
aversion. affect avoiding particular location occurs one trial. good
example one trial learning. somehow animal knows shocked
location, remembers that. hippocampal dependent learning. animals lack
hippocampus hippocampus pharmacologically otherwise
incapacitated, will not learn new bit information. animals do,
remember first time every time. Unless, block release
certain chemicals brain body chemicals referring
epinephrine, adrenaline, extent corticosterones. Things like cortisol.
Now know effect getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine,
least particular experimental scenario. researchers exact
experiment, done exact experiment, introduce
pharmacological blocker epinephrine, epinephrine released response
shock, cannot actually bind receptors biological effects,
well animal perfectly happy tread back area received
shock. almost didn't know, assume, didn't remember
received shock location. seems pretty obvious hear it.
Something bad happens location, don't go back location.
condition place avoidance. turns opposite also true. Meaning
something called condition place preference can take animal, put arena,
feed reward one location arena. can give hungry rat
mouse food one particular location, take animal out, come back next day.
No food introduced, will go back location received food.
can variant this. can make arena little bit chilly provide
warmth location. can take male animal. turns male rats
mice will mate point. female animal particular called receptive
phase mating cycle give opportunity mate give location,
go back location wait away. perhaps people go back
bar, seat bar, restaurant wait one time they,
know, things worked them. Whatever context was. Condition place
preference. Condition place preference condition place avoidance depends


release adrenaline, right. not just stress. heightened
emotional state brain body. Okay, really important. not just
stress. can get one trial learning positive events, condition place preference.
can get one trial learning negative events. say positive negative,
putting called valence it. Making value judgment whether not
animal liked didn't like it. presume animal liked didn't like
felt. turns true humans well. know
McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning
episode immediately after? Well, ingest something drinking take
capsule form, period time gets absorbed body.
different substances, caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc absorbed gut
blood stream reach brain trigger affects brain body
different rates. not instantaneous. effects within minutes, others
within tens minutes on. really going depend pharmacology
things also going depend whether not food gut,
else happen circulating blood stream, etc. basic
level can confidently say not one, not dozens, mentioned
before, hundreds studies animals humans point fact triggering
increase adrenaline late learning immediately learning going
beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize
enhance improve memory, data McGaugh Cahill many
laboratories stemmed initial work really point fact ideal
protocol focus thing trying learn intensely. also
things like error rates, etc. Please see episodes learning.
newsletter learn better. can access HubermanLab.com. zero
cost newsletter. can grab PDF. lists things learning
about. Still try get excellent sleep. Again, fundamentally important mental health,
physical health, performance. can now extend performance saying
including learning memory. Nap doesn't interrupt nighttime sleep. Naps
anywhere 10 90 minutes. non-sleep deep rest protocols will enhance learning
memory, can now add that, spiking adrenaline provided can
done safe way, going reduce number repetitions required learn.
done tail end immediately learning about.
compatible protocols mentioned. reason revisiting
stuff sleep non-sleep deep rest think people got impression
need immediately learning today saying contrary.
Immediately learning need go heightened state emotionality
alertness. Now vitally important point not need pharmacology.
don't need caffeine. don't need Alpha GPC. don't need pharmacologic
substance spike adrenaline unless something already doing.
can safely. know can safely. always say, say
again, not physician not prescribing anything. professor, profess
things. need safe you. somebody not used
drinking caffeine suddenly drink four espresso trying learn something,


going severe increase alertness probably even anxiety.
panic attack prone, please don't start taking stimulants order learn things better.
Please safe. don't just say protect me, say protect you.
mention not accustomed taking something, always want first
check doctor, course,

01:04:48 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Deliberate Cold Exposure, Adrenaline

also move gradually, right? Start lowest effective dose. minimal
effective dose. sometimes minimal effective dose zero milligrams, nothing.
say that? Well, already talked results put people's arms
ice bath order evoke adrenaline release. welcome
want. fact, pretty low cost, zero pharmacology. least exogenous
pharmacology way approach whole thing. way evoking
natural epinephrine turns also dopamine release. take cold shower.
ice bath get cold circulating bath. done several episodes
utility cold health performance. can find episodes
HubermanLab.com. Also episode colleague Stanford biology
department, Dr. Craig Heller. Lots protocols, particular episode cold
health performance. describe best use cold shower ice bath
circulating cold bath order evoke epinephrine dopamine release.
point time want protocols after, ideally
immediately learning about. Meaning sitting learn new
information trying learn new physical skill. Now whether not
compatible reasons deliberate cold exposure, whether
not compatible things doing, depends contour
lifestyle, training, academic goals, learning goals, etc.
specific purpose enhance learning memory, want spike adrenaline
afterwards. telling can caffeine. can
Alpha GPC. can combination caffeine Alpha GPC.
can safely. know using forms pharmacology.
long episode ADHD. just really declare stance clearly
not fan, actually opposed people using prescription drugs not
prescribed drugs order enhance alertness. think big addictive


potential. also potential really disrupt one's pharmacology around
dopaminergic system. However, know prescribed things like ritalin,
Adderall modafinil things sort order increase alertness focus.
prescribed things board certified physician,
going decide going take trying learn
trying learn. also take consideration drugs
long acting. shorter acting. time according trying
learn when. pharmacology. mentioned, behavioral
protocols. can use cold cold excellent stimulus first all,
doesn't involve pharmacology. Second all, can generally access low zero
cost, especially cold shower approach. third, can titrate it. can start
warmer water. can make very, cold thing able
tolerate safely. can make moderately cold. cold order
invoke adrenaline release? Well, uncomfortably cold cold enough
feel like really want get out, can stay safely. going evoke
adrenaline release. quickens breathing, makes go wide eyed.
increasing adrenaline release. fact, effects going wide eyed quickening
breathing challenges thinking clearly, direct effects
adrenaline brain body. course, ways increase
adrenaline. go hard run. number things
increase adrenaline body. things choose you,
clear, solid grounding research data, can confidently say spiking
adrenaline interacting material, physical cognitive material

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data
epinephrine release, better people remembered material.
shown. Whether not cognitive material, learning
language, learning passage words, learning mathematics. whether not
physical learning. want emphasize something physical learning
know number probably drinking cup coffee cup yerba
mate maybe even energy drink taking Alpha GPC something
physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work
matter, guest. think perfectly fine, provided safe you.
moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects

easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain

other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not

particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise

splitter comes sensory events. areas brain become
active very, specific conditions conditions. similarly,
epinephrine just molecule. just chemical circulating brain body.
no epinephrine specifically cold shower distinct epinephrine

really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit

sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

emotionally intense language. language evoke emotionally
intense response person reading it. might talked car accident
intense surgery. also positive stuff. Things like birthday party,
celebration kind. big sports win. words, two
conditions study. People either read boring paragraph, read really
emotionally laden paragraph. again, emotions either positive
negative emotions. Subjects left laboratory sometime later called back
laboratory say, no point experiment know
part memory experiment. Okay, don't even know reading
paragraph. came either class credit get paid. typically
things done college campuses elsewhere. come back lab
get pop quiz. asked recall content paragraph
read previously. Now probably expected, perhaps even obvious
you, subjects read emotionally intense paragraph remembered far
content paragraph far accurate remembering
information. Now, particular finding wasn't novel. Many people previously
described emotionally intense events better remembered non-emotionally
intense events. fact, way back 1600s Francis Bacon, largely credited
developing scientific method, said, quote, memory assisted anything
makes impression powerful passion. Inspiring fear, example, wonder,
shame, joy.

00:41:42 Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline

Francis Bacon said 1620. Jim McGaugh Larry Cahill certainly not
first demonstrate conceive idea emotionally laden experiences
easily remembered experiences. However, next
immensely important understanding memory building tools
enhance learning memory. evaluated capacity stress
particular neuro chemicals associated stress improve ability learn
information. Not just information emotional, information kinds.
going describe experiments done animal models just briefly,
experiments done humans subjects. McGaugh worked mainly animals,
also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively human subjects. take


rat mouse put arena one location animal receives
electrical shock come back next day, remove shock evoking
device let animal move around arena, animal will, quite
understandably, avoid location shocked. called conditioned place
aversion. affect avoiding particular location occurs one trial. good
example one trial learning. somehow animal knows shocked
location, remembers that. hippocampal dependent learning. animals lack
hippocampus hippocampus pharmacologically otherwise
incapacitated, will not learn new bit information. animals do,
remember first time every time. Unless, block release
certain chemicals brain body chemicals referring
epinephrine, adrenaline, extent corticosterones. Things like cortisol.
Now know effect getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine,
least particular experimental scenario. researchers exact
experiment, done exact experiment, introduce
pharmacological blocker epinephrine, epinephrine released response
shock, cannot actually bind receptors biological effects,
well animal perfectly happy tread back area received
shock. almost didn't know, assume, didn't remember
received shock location. seems pretty obvious hear it.
Something bad happens location, don't go back location.
condition place avoidance. turns opposite also true. Meaning
something called condition place preference can take animal, put arena,
feed reward one location arena. can give hungry rat
mouse food one particular location, take animal out, come back next day.
No food introduced, will go back location received food.
can variant this. can make arena little bit chilly provide
warmth location. can take male animal. turns male rats
mice will mate point. female animal particular called receptive
phase mating cycle give opportunity mate give location,
go back location wait away. perhaps people go back
bar, seat bar, restaurant wait one time they,
know, things worked them. Whatever context was. Condition place
preference. Condition place preference condition place avoidance depends


release adrenaline, right. not just stress. heightened
emotional state brain body. Okay, really important. not just
stress. can get one trial learning positive events, condition place preference.
can get one trial learning negative events. say positive negative,
putting called valence it. Making value judgment whether not
animal liked didn't like it. presume animal liked didn't like
felt. turns true humans well. know
McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects

easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular

particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise

good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer

affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise

many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function

cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really

ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real

Maybe actually can't move stressed increased

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

rat mouse put arena one location animal receives
electrical shock come back next day, remove shock evoking
device let animal move around arena, animal will, quite
understandably, avoid location shocked. called conditioned place
aversion. affect avoiding particular location occurs one trial. good
example one trial learning. somehow animal knows shocked
location, remembers that. hippocampal dependent learning. animals lack
hippocampus hippocampus pharmacologically otherwise
incapacitated, will not learn new bit information. animals do,
remember first time every time. Unless, block release
certain chemicals brain body chemicals referring
epinephrine, adrenaline, extent corticosterones. Things like cortisol.
Now know effect getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine,
least particular experimental scenario. researchers exact
experiment, done exact experiment, introduce
pharmacological blocker epinephrine, epinephrine released response

well animal perfectly happy tread back area received
shock. almost didn't know, assume, didn't remember
received shock location. seems pretty obvious hear it.
Something bad happens location, don't go back location.
condition place avoidance. turns opposite also true. Meaning
something called condition place preference can take animal, put arena,
feed reward one location arena. can give hungry rat
mouse food one particular location, take animal out, come back next day.
No food introduced, will go back location received food.
can variant this. can make arena little bit chilly provide

stress. can get one trial learning positive events, condition place preference.
can get one trial learning negative events. say positive negative,

felt. turns true humans well. know
McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning
episode immediately after? Well, ingest something drinking take
capsule form, period time gets absorbed body.
different substances, caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc absorbed gut
blood stream reach brain trigger affects brain body
different rates. not instantaneous. effects within minutes, others
within tens minutes on. really going depend pharmacology
things also going depend whether not food gut,
else happen circulating blood stream, etc. basic
level can confidently say not one, not dozens, mentioned
before, hundreds studies animals humans point fact triggering
increase adrenaline late learning immediately learning going
beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize
enhance improve memory, data McGaugh Cahill many
laboratories stemmed initial work really point fact ideal
protocol focus thing trying learn intensely. also
things like error rates, etc. Please see episodes learning.
newsletter learn better. can access HubermanLab.com. zero
cost newsletter. can grab PDF. lists things learning
about. Still try get excellent sleep. Again, fundamentally important mental health,
physical health, performance. can now extend performance saying
including learning memory. Nap doesn't interrupt nighttime sleep. Naps
anywhere 10 90 minutes. non-sleep deep rest protocols will enhance learning
memory, can now add that, spiking adrenaline provided can
done safe way, going reduce number repetitions required learn.
done tail end immediately learning about.
compatible protocols mentioned. reason revisiting
stuff sleep non-sleep deep rest think people got impression
need immediately learning today saying contrary.
Immediately learning need go heightened state emotionality
alertness. Now vitally important point not need pharmacology.
don't need caffeine. don't need Alpha GPC. don't need pharmacologic
substance spike adrenaline unless something already doing.
can safely. know can safely. always say, say
again, not physician not prescribing anything. professor, profess
things. need safe you. somebody not used
drinking caffeine suddenly drink four espresso trying learn something,


going severe increase alertness probably even anxiety.
panic attack prone, please don't start taking stimulants order learn things better.
Please safe. don't just say protect me, say protect you.
mention not accustomed taking something, always want first
check doctor, course,

01:04:48 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Deliberate Cold Exposure, Adrenaline

also move gradually, right? Start lowest effective dose. minimal
effective dose. sometimes minimal effective dose zero milligrams, nothing.
say that? Well, already talked results put people's arms
ice bath order evoke adrenaline release. welcome
want. fact, pretty low cost, zero pharmacology. least exogenous
pharmacology way approach whole thing. way evoking
natural epinephrine turns also dopamine release. take cold shower.
ice bath get cold circulating bath. done several episodes
utility cold health performance. can find episodes
HubermanLab.com. Also episode colleague Stanford biology
department, Dr. Craig Heller. Lots protocols, particular episode cold
health performance. describe best use cold shower ice bath
circulating cold bath order evoke epinephrine dopamine release.
point time want protocols after, ideally
immediately learning about. Meaning sitting learn new
information trying learn new physical skill. Now whether not
compatible reasons deliberate cold exposure, whether
not compatible things doing, depends contour
lifestyle, training, academic goals, learning goals, etc.
specific purpose enhance learning memory, want spike adrenaline
afterwards. telling can caffeine. can
Alpha GPC. can combination caffeine Alpha GPC.
can safely. know using forms pharmacology.
long episode ADHD. just really declare stance clearly
not fan, actually opposed people using prescription drugs not
prescribed drugs order enhance alertness. think big addictive


potential. also potential really disrupt one's pharmacology around
dopaminergic system. However, know prescribed things like ritalin,
Adderall modafinil things sort order increase alertness focus.
prescribed things board certified physician,
going decide going take trying learn
trying learn. also take consideration drugs
long acting. shorter acting. time according trying
learn when. pharmacology. mentioned, behavioral
protocols. can use cold cold excellent stimulus first all,
doesn't involve pharmacology. Second all, can generally access low zero
cost, especially cold shower approach. third, can titrate it. can start
warmer water. can make very, cold thing able
tolerate safely. can make moderately cold. cold order
invoke adrenaline release? Well, uncomfortably cold cold enough
feel like really want get out, can stay safely. going evoke
adrenaline release. quickens breathing, makes go wide eyed.
increasing adrenaline release. fact, effects going wide eyed quickening
breathing challenges thinking clearly, direct effects
adrenaline brain body. course, ways increase
adrenaline. go hard run. number things
increase adrenaline body. things choose you,
clear, solid grounding research data, can confidently say spiking
adrenaline interacting material, physical cognitive material

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data
epinephrine release, better people remembered material.
shown. Whether not cognitive material, learning
language, learning passage words, learning mathematics. whether not
physical learning. want emphasize something physical learning
know number probably drinking cup coffee cup yerba
mate maybe even energy drink taking Alpha GPC something
physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work
matter, guest. think perfectly fine, provided safe you.
moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start
become afraid entire city blocks one bad thing happened particular room
particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise
specific nuanced every little detail. amygdala lumper
splitter comes sensory events. areas brain become
active very, specific conditions conditions. similarly,
epinephrine just molecule. just chemical circulating brain body.
no epinephrine specifically cold shower distinct epinephrine
associated bad event distinct epinephrine associated
really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

release adrenaline, right. not just stress. heightened
emotional state brain body. Okay, really important. not just
stress. can get one trial learning positive events, condition place preference.
can get one trial learning negative events. say positive negative,
putting called valence it. Making value judgment whether not
animal liked didn't like it. presume animal liked didn't like
felt. turns true humans well. know
McGaugh Cahill experiments gave people boring
paragraph read boring paragraph read. one group subjects
asked read paragraph place arm very, cold water.
fact, ice water. know placing one's arm ice water, especially
shoulder near it, evokes release adrenaline body. not
enormous release, significant increase. yes, measured adrenaline
release. cases also measured things like cortisol, etc.
found one evokes release adrenaline arm ice water
approach, information read previously, just minutes before,
remembered, retained well emotionally intense information. keep
mind information read not interesting all. least, wasn't
emotionally laden. effect adrenaline released brain
body, blocked release

00:47:14 Adrenaline & Cortisol

function adrenaline brain body, block effect. Now
biology epinephrine cortisol little bit complex, nuance
actually interesting important us. First all, adrenaline released
body brain. released body adrenals. Remember,
epinephrine adrenaline thing. Cortisol also released
adrenal glands. two little glands ride atop kidneys. can't cross
brain. call peripheral effects. Quickening heart rate, right?
Changes patterns blood flow. Changes patterns breathing. general,
makes breathing shallow faster. general makes heart beat
quickly, etc. Within brain little brain area called locus coeruleus,
back brain. opportunity sprinkler rest brain


neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.

caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations

somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain

other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not

lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.

cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.

lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts

neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, well norepinephrine, related
neuromodulator. essentially wake create state alertness throughout
brain. general effect. reason two sites release
neuro chemicals not cross blood-brain barrier. waking body
adrenaline waking brain two separate, so-called parallel phenomena.
Cortisol can cross blood-brain barrier lipophilic. Meaning can move
fatty tissue. get biology another episode. cortisol
general released much longer term effects. just told you, can
permeate throughout brain body. Adrenaline local effects. least
segregated brain body. will turn important later.
important thing keep mind emotionality evoked
experience, precise, emotional state
experience something dictates whether not will learn quickly not.
absolutely important terms thinking tools improve memory. no,
not going suggest every time want learn something plunge
arm ice water. won't suggest that? Well, will induce release
adrenaline, better ways get adrenaline release. explain
exactly tools are, want tamp biology works.

00:49:35 Accelerating Repetition Curve & Adrenaline

understanding will access best possible tools improve
memory. First all, McGaugh Cahill excellent experimentalists.
not just establish quicken formation memory accessing
material emotionally laden creating emotional, high adrenaline state
interacting thing. word, person, information. also
tested whether not whole effect blocked blocking emotional state
blocking adrenaline. people read paragraphs
either lot emotional content people read paragraphs pretty
boring, put arm ice water. say
experiments increase adrenaline. even shock experiments
done groups. number things evoke release adrenaline.
Even people taking drugs increase adrenaline. also
called blocking experiments. experiments people get


highly emotional state reading highly emotional material, got people get
highly emotional neuro chemical state reading boring material taking
drug increase adrenaline, ice bath, shock. also administered
drug called beta blocker block affect adrenaline related chemicals
brain body. found even people exposed something
really emotional lot adrenaline system received drug
increase amount adrenaline. Two manipulations normally increase
memory, keep mind. gave beta blocker, reduced
response adrenaline, right? no quickening heart rate. No quickening
breathing. No increase activity locus coeruleus kind wake
signals rest brain. Well then, material wasn't remembered better all.
tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists
right. stating thinking high emotional states help learn things.
McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,
presence high adrenaline, high amounts norepinephrine epinephrine
perhaps cortisol well, soon see, allows memory stamped
quickly. not emotion. neuro chemical state go
consequence emotion. important understand two
things related, not one thing. means
evoke release epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol even
just one two chemicals experiencing something, stamping
experience just previously had. Now fundamentally important far
away different idea remember things important
us, evoke emotion. true, real reason, neuro chemical
reason, mechanism behind neuro chemicals ability
strengthen neural connections making active just once. something truly
magic

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning
episode immediately after? Well, ingest something drinking take
capsule form, period time gets absorbed body.
different substances, caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc absorbed gut
blood stream reach brain trigger affects brain body
different rates. not instantaneous. effects within minutes, others
within tens minutes on. really going depend pharmacology
things also going depend whether not food gut,
else happen circulating blood stream, etc. basic
level can confidently say not one, not dozens, mentioned
before, hundreds studies animals humans point fact triggering
increase adrenaline late learning immediately learning going
beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize
enhance improve memory, data McGaugh Cahill many
laboratories stemmed initial work really point fact ideal
protocol focus thing trying learn intensely. also
things like error rates, etc. Please see episodes learning.
newsletter learn better. can access HubermanLab.com. zero
cost newsletter. can grab PDF. lists things learning
about. Still try get excellent sleep. Again, fundamentally important mental health,
physical health, performance. can now extend performance saying
including learning memory. Nap doesn't interrupt nighttime sleep. Naps
anywhere 10 90 minutes. non-sleep deep rest protocols will enhance learning
memory, can now add that, spiking adrenaline provided can
done safe way, going reduce number repetitions required learn.
done tail end immediately learning about.
compatible protocols mentioned. reason revisiting
stuff sleep non-sleep deep rest think people got impression
need immediately learning today saying contrary.
Immediately learning need go heightened state emotionality
alertness. Now vitally important point not need pharmacology.
don't need caffeine. don't need Alpha GPC. don't need pharmacologic
substance spike adrenaline unless something already doing.
can safely. know can safely. always say, say
again, not physician not prescribing anything. professor, profess
things. need safe you. somebody not used
drinking caffeine suddenly drink four espresso trying learn something,


going severe increase alertness probably even anxiety.
panic attack prone, please don't start taking stimulants order learn things better.
Please safe. don't just say protect me, say protect you.
mention not accustomed taking something, always want first
check doctor, course,

01:04:48 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Deliberate Cold Exposure, Adrenaline

also move gradually, right? Start lowest effective dose. minimal
effective dose. sometimes minimal effective dose zero milligrams, nothing.
say that? Well, already talked results put people's arms
ice bath order evoke adrenaline release. welcome
want. fact, pretty low cost, zero pharmacology. least exogenous
pharmacology way approach whole thing. way evoking
natural epinephrine turns also dopamine release. take cold shower.
ice bath get cold circulating bath. done several episodes
utility cold health performance. can find episodes
HubermanLab.com. Also episode colleague Stanford biology
department, Dr. Craig Heller. Lots protocols, particular episode cold
health performance. describe best use cold shower ice bath
circulating cold bath order evoke epinephrine dopamine release.
point time want protocols after, ideally
immediately learning about. Meaning sitting learn new
information trying learn new physical skill. Now whether not
compatible reasons deliberate cold exposure, whether
not compatible things doing, depends contour
lifestyle, training, academic goals, learning goals, etc.
specific purpose enhance learning memory, want spike adrenaline
afterwards. telling can caffeine. can
Alpha GPC. can combination caffeine Alpha GPC.
can safely. know using forms pharmacology.
long episode ADHD. just really declare stance clearly
not fan, actually opposed people using prescription drugs not
prescribed drugs order enhance alertness. think big addictive


potential. also potential really disrupt one's pharmacology around
dopaminergic system. However, know prescribed things like ritalin,
Adderall modafinil things sort order increase alertness focus.
prescribed things board certified physician,
going decide going take trying learn
trying learn. also take consideration drugs
long acting. shorter acting. time according trying
learn when. pharmacology. mentioned, behavioral
protocols. can use cold cold excellent stimulus first all,
doesn't involve pharmacology. Second all, can generally access low zero
cost, especially cold shower approach. third, can titrate it. can start
warmer water. can make very, cold thing able
tolerate safely. can make moderately cold. cold order
invoke adrenaline release? Well, uncomfortably cold cold enough
feel like really want get out, can stay safely. going evoke
adrenaline release. quickens breathing, makes go wide eyed.
increasing adrenaline release. fact, effects going wide eyed quickening
breathing challenges thinking clearly, direct effects
adrenaline brain body. course, ways increase
adrenaline. go hard run. number things
increase adrenaline body. things choose you,
clear, solid grounding research data, can confidently say spiking
adrenaline interacting material, physical cognitive material

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data
epinephrine release, better people remembered material.
shown. Whether not cognitive material, learning
language, learning passage words, learning mathematics. whether not
physical learning. want emphasize something physical learning
know number probably drinking cup coffee cup yerba
mate maybe even energy drink taking Alpha GPC something
physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work
matter, guest. think perfectly fine, provided safe you.
moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start
become afraid entire city blocks one bad thing happened particular room
particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise
specific nuanced every little detail. amygdala lumper
splitter comes sensory events. areas brain become
active very, specific conditions conditions. similarly,
epinephrine just molecule. just chemical circulating brain body.
no epinephrine specifically cold shower distinct epinephrine
associated bad event distinct epinephrine associated
really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation

rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts

tells us that, yes, Francis Bacon right. McGaugh Cahill right.
Hundreds, not thousands philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists

McGaugh Cahill really showed, important know,

00:53:03 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Caffeine, Alpha-GPC & Stimulant
Timing

neuro chemical cocktail removes need repetition. Okay, apply
knowledge. establish scientifically grounded set tools. Meaning tools


take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning
episode immediately after? Well, ingest something drinking take
capsule form, period time gets absorbed body.
different substances, caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc absorbed gut
blood stream reach brain trigger affects brain body
different rates. not instantaneous. effects within minutes, others
within tens minutes on. really going depend pharmacology
things also going depend whether not food gut,
else happen circulating blood stream, etc. basic
level can confidently say not one, not dozens, mentioned
before, hundreds studies animals humans point fact triggering
increase adrenaline late learning immediately learning going
beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.

difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start
become afraid entire city blocks one bad thing happened particular room
particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise
specific nuanced every little detail. amygdala lumper
splitter comes sensory events. areas brain become
active very, specific conditions conditions. similarly,
epinephrine just molecule. just chemical circulating brain body.
no epinephrine specifically cold shower distinct epinephrine
associated bad event distinct epinephrine associated
really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real

especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin

going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,

decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue

mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential

connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know

mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back

First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human

take account identity neuro chemicals important enhancing
learning timing release chemicals order enhance learning.
first learned results McGaugh Cahill, just blown away.
also pretty upset, not them, upset myself. realized
way approaching learning memory not optimal. fact,
probably opposite direction enhanced protocol learning memory
going teach today. typical mode trying learn something
college, graduate school, junior professor, tenured
professor sit whatever going try learn, perhaps
even memorize. physical skill, move whatever environment going
learn physical skill in, prior that, make sure hydrated,
important me. certainly can contribute brain's ability function
body's ability function. general patterns alertness. also, caffeinate.
nice, strong cup coffee espresso. nice strong cup
yerba mate. still drink coffee yerba mate regularly. drink
moderation, think. Certainly me. typically drink things
engage kind attempt learn memorize. acquire new skill. Now
caffeine form coffee yerba mate form caffeine create
sense alertness brain body two major
mechanisms. first mechanism blocking effects adenosine. Adenosine
molecule builds brain body longer awake.
largely responsible feelings sleepiness fatigue
awake long time. Caffeine essentially acts block effects adenosine.
competing agonist, not get technical, binds receptor adenosine
period time prevents adenosine normal pattern action.
thereby reduces feelings fatigue. also increases state alertness.
reducing fatigue, also pushing neuro chemical systems order
directly increase alertness. large part increasing
transmission epinephrine, adrenaline, brain body. also interesting
effect regulating number efficiency, say efficacy, dopamine
receptors. dopamine present, molecule increases
motivation, craving, pursuit, dopamine can potent effect
otherwise. caffeine really hits three systems. hits systems too,
mainly reduces fatigue reducing adenosine, increases alertness increasing


epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning
episode immediately after? Well, ingest something drinking take
capsule form, period time gets absorbed body.
different substances, caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc absorbed gut
blood stream reach brain trigger affects brain body
different rates. not instantaneous. effects within minutes, others
within tens minutes on. really going depend pharmacology
things also going depend whether not food gut,
else happen circulating blood stream, etc. basic
level can confidently say not one, not dozens, mentioned
before, hundreds studies animals humans point fact triggering
increase adrenaline late learning immediately learning going
beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize
enhance improve memory, data McGaugh Cahill many
laboratories stemmed initial work really point fact ideal
protocol focus thing trying learn intensely. also
things like error rates, etc. Please see episodes learning.
newsletter learn better. can access HubermanLab.com. zero
cost newsletter. can grab PDF. lists things learning
about. Still try get excellent sleep. Again, fundamentally important mental health,
physical health, performance. can now extend performance saying
including learning memory. Nap doesn't interrupt nighttime sleep. Naps
anywhere 10 90 minutes. non-sleep deep rest protocols will enhance learning
memory, can now add that, spiking adrenaline provided can
done safe way, going reduce number repetitions required learn.
done tail end immediately learning about.
compatible protocols mentioned. reason revisiting
stuff sleep non-sleep deep rest think people got impression
need immediately learning today saying contrary.
Immediately learning need go heightened state emotionality
alertness. Now vitally important point not need pharmacology.
don't need caffeine. don't need Alpha GPC. don't need pharmacologic
substance spike adrenaline unless something already doing.
can safely. know can safely. always say, say
again, not physician not prescribing anything. professor, profess
things. need safe you. somebody not used
drinking caffeine suddenly drink four espresso trying learn something,


going severe increase alertness probably even anxiety.
panic attack prone, please don't start taking stimulants order learn things better.
Please safe. don't just say protect me, say protect you.
mention not accustomed taking something, always want first
check doctor, course,

01:04:48 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Deliberate Cold Exposure, Adrenaline

also move gradually, right? Start lowest effective dose. minimal
effective dose. sometimes minimal effective dose zero milligrams, nothing.
say that? Well, already talked results put people's arms
ice bath order evoke adrenaline release. welcome
want. fact, pretty low cost, zero pharmacology. least exogenous
pharmacology way approach whole thing. way evoking
natural epinephrine turns also dopamine release. take cold shower.
ice bath get cold circulating bath. done several episodes
utility cold health performance. can find episodes
HubermanLab.com. Also episode colleague Stanford biology
department, Dr. Craig Heller. Lots protocols, particular episode cold
health performance. describe best use cold shower ice bath
circulating cold bath order evoke epinephrine dopamine release.
point time want protocols after, ideally
immediately learning about. Meaning sitting learn new
information trying learn new physical skill. Now whether not
compatible reasons deliberate cold exposure, whether
not compatible things doing, depends contour
lifestyle, training, academic goals, learning goals, etc.
specific purpose enhance learning memory, want spike adrenaline
afterwards. telling can caffeine. can
Alpha GPC. can combination caffeine Alpha GPC.
can safely. know using forms pharmacology.
long episode ADHD. just really declare stance clearly
not fan, actually opposed people using prescription drugs not
prescribed drugs order enhance alertness. think big addictive


potential. also potential really disrupt one's pharmacology around
dopaminergic system. However, know prescribed things like ritalin,
Adderall modafinil things sort order increase alertness focus.
prescribed things board certified physician,
going decide going take trying learn
trying learn. also take consideration drugs
long acting. shorter acting. time according trying
learn when. pharmacology. mentioned, behavioral
protocols. can use cold cold excellent stimulus first all,
doesn't involve pharmacology. Second all, can generally access low zero
cost, especially cold shower approach. third, can titrate it. can start
warmer water. can make very, cold thing able
tolerate safely. can make moderately cold. cold order
invoke adrenaline release? Well, uncomfortably cold cold enough
feel like really want get out, can stay safely. going evoke
adrenaline release. quickens breathing, makes go wide eyed.
increasing adrenaline release. fact, effects going wide eyed quickening
breathing challenges thinking clearly, direct effects
adrenaline brain body. course, ways increase
adrenaline. go hard run. number things
increase adrenaline body. things choose you,
clear, solid grounding research data, can confidently say spiking
adrenaline interacting material, physical cognitive material

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data
epinephrine release, better people remembered material.
shown. Whether not cognitive material, learning
language, learning passage words, learning mathematics. whether not
physical learning. want emphasize something physical learning
know number probably drinking cup coffee cup yerba
mate maybe even energy drink taking Alpha GPC something
physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work
matter, guest. think perfectly fine, provided safe you.
moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start
become afraid entire city blocks one bad thing happened particular room
particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise
specific nuanced every little detail. amygdala lumper
splitter comes sensory events. areas brain become
active very, specific conditions conditions. similarly,
epinephrine just molecule. just chemical circulating brain body.
no epinephrine specifically cold shower distinct epinephrine
associated bad event distinct epinephrine associated
really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one

moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood

increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin

John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

epinephrine release, adrenaline release say, adrenals
body form locus coeruleus within brain. can, parallel that,
increase action efficacy action dopamine. typical way
approaching learning memory drink caffeine focus really
hard whatever trying learn. Try eliminate distractions
hope, hope, hope. try, try, try remember information best could.
frankly, felt like working pretty well me. typically, leveraged
forms pharmacology order enhance learning memory, things like Alpha
GPC, phosphatidyl serine, taking things sat
learn particular set information. went off learn particular physical
skill. Now, listening probably thinking, well, okay.
results McGaugh Cahill pointed fact adrenaline released
learning something enhanced learning thing. lot things like
caffeine, Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine adrenaline dopamine
molecules brain body can enhance memory long period time.
makes sense take first, even learning, allow increase
occur. increase will occur long period time will enhance learning
memory. partially true, not entirely true. turns not
optimal. Work done McGaugh laboratory, laboratories
evaluated precise temporal relationship neuro chemical activation
pathways learning memory. animals people,
depending experiment, take drug. caffeine. pill form.
Something increase adrenaline related molecules create state
alertness related emotionality. either hour before,
30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, five minutes learning,
learning, right? reading information performing skill
one trying learn. five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.
afterwards. looked precisely exactly best evoke
adrenaline release. turns best time window evoke release
chemicals, goal enhance learning memory material either
immediately just minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes repeating
information. trying learn information. Again, cognitive
information physical skill. Now really spits face way
us approach learning memory. us, use stimulants like


caffeine Alpha GPC, taking attempt learn, not
afterwards. results point fact learning memory
really want get big increase epinephrine related molecules will
tamp memory. means currently using caffeine
compounds, talk safety issues forth
moment. using compounds order enhance learning memory
taking learning episode, well encourage try
take either late learning episode immediately learning episode.
Now given everything told now say late learning
episode immediately after? Well, ingest something drinking take
capsule form, period time gets absorbed body.
different substances, caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc absorbed gut
blood stream reach brain trigger affects brain body
different rates. not instantaneous. effects within minutes, others
within tens minutes on. really going depend pharmacology
things also going depend whether not food gut,
else happen circulating blood stream, etc. basic
level can confidently say not one, not dozens, mentioned
before, hundreds studies animals humans point fact triggering
increase adrenaline late learning immediately learning going
beneficial goal retain information period time.

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize
enhance improve memory, data McGaugh Cahill many
laboratories stemmed initial work really point fact ideal
protocol focus thing trying learn intensely. also
things like error rates, etc. Please see episodes learning.
newsletter learn better. can access HubermanLab.com. zero
cost newsletter. can grab PDF. lists things learning
about. Still try get excellent sleep. Again, fundamentally important mental health,
physical health, performance. can now extend performance saying
including learning memory. Nap doesn't interrupt nighttime sleep. Naps
anywhere 10 90 minutes. non-sleep deep rest protocols will enhance learning
memory, can now add that, spiking adrenaline provided can
done safe way, going reduce number repetitions required learn.
done tail end immediately learning about.
compatible protocols mentioned. reason revisiting
stuff sleep non-sleep deep rest think people got impression
need immediately learning today saying contrary.
Immediately learning need go heightened state emotionality
alertness. Now vitally important point not need pharmacology.
don't need caffeine. don't need Alpha GPC. don't need pharmacologic
substance spike adrenaline unless something already doing.
can safely. know can safely. always say, say
again, not physician not prescribing anything. professor, profess
things. need safe you. somebody not used
drinking caffeine suddenly drink four espresso trying learn something,


going severe increase alertness probably even anxiety.
panic attack prone, please don't start taking stimulants order learn things better.
Please safe. don't just say protect me, say protect you.
mention not accustomed taking something, always want first
check doctor, course,

01:04:48 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Deliberate Cold Exposure, Adrenaline

also move gradually, right? Start lowest effective dose. minimal
effective dose. sometimes minimal effective dose zero milligrams, nothing.
say that? Well, already talked results put people's arms
ice bath order evoke adrenaline release. welcome
want. fact, pretty low cost, zero pharmacology. least exogenous
pharmacology way approach whole thing. way evoking
natural epinephrine turns also dopamine release. take cold shower.
ice bath get cold circulating bath. done several episodes
utility cold health performance. can find episodes
HubermanLab.com. Also episode colleague Stanford biology
department, Dr. Craig Heller. Lots protocols, particular episode cold
health performance. describe best use cold shower ice bath
circulating cold bath order evoke epinephrine dopamine release.
point time want protocols after, ideally
immediately learning about. Meaning sitting learn new
information trying learn new physical skill. Now whether not
compatible reasons deliberate cold exposure, whether
not compatible things doing, depends contour
lifestyle, training, academic goals, learning goals, etc.
specific purpose enhance learning memory, want spike adrenaline
afterwards. telling can caffeine. can
Alpha GPC. can combination caffeine Alpha GPC.
can safely. know using forms pharmacology.
long episode ADHD. just really declare stance clearly
not fan, actually opposed people using prescription drugs not
prescribed drugs order enhance alertness. think big addictive


potential. also potential really disrupt one's pharmacology around
dopaminergic system. However, know prescribed things like ritalin,
Adderall modafinil things sort order increase alertness focus.
prescribed things board certified physician,
going decide going take trying learn
trying learn. also take consideration drugs
long acting. shorter acting. time according trying
learn when. pharmacology. mentioned, behavioral
protocols. can use cold cold excellent stimulus first all,
doesn't involve pharmacology. Second all, can generally access low zero
cost, especially cold shower approach. third, can titrate it. can start
warmer water. can make very, cold thing able
tolerate safely. can make moderately cold. cold order
invoke adrenaline release? Well, uncomfortably cold cold enough
feel like really want get out, can stay safely. going evoke
adrenaline release. quickens breathing, makes go wide eyed.
increasing adrenaline release. fact, effects going wide eyed quickening
breathing challenges thinking clearly, direct effects
adrenaline brain body. course, ways increase
adrenaline. go hard run. number things
increase adrenaline body. things choose you,
clear, solid grounding research data, can confidently say spiking
adrenaline interacting material, physical cognitive material

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data
epinephrine release, better people remembered material.
shown. Whether not cognitive material, learning
language, learning passage words, learning mathematics. whether not
physical learning. want emphasize something physical learning
know number probably drinking cup coffee cup yerba
mate maybe even energy drink taking Alpha GPC something
physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work
matter, guest. think perfectly fine, provided safe you.
moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts

01:00:50 Tool: Enhancing Learning & Memory - Sleep, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)

reduce number repetitions required order learn information. Now,
want acknowledge previous episodes podcast appearing
podcasts, talked lot things like non-sleep deep rest, naps,
sleep vital learning process. want emphasize none
information changed. don't look information differently
consequence talking today. still true strengthening
connections brain, literal neural plasticity, changing circuits occurs
deep sleep non-sleep deep rest. also true, mentioned
results earlier two papers published Cell Reports, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal last years showing brief naps 20 90


minutes period time attempt learn can enhance rate learning
memory. However, bouts sleep, deep sleep night, say,
brief naps, even so-called NSDR call it, non-sleep deep rest
used enhance learning memory particular pieces information. Either
cognitive physical information both. still can performed, can
performed hours later, even hour later. can performed two hours later
four hours later. Remember, naps deep sleep actual
reconfiguration neural circuits occurs, strengthening neural circuits
occurs. not case need finish learning drop immediately
nap sleep. people might that, really trying optimize
enhance improve memory, data McGaugh Cahill many
laboratories stemmed initial work really point fact ideal
protocol focus thing trying learn intensely. also
things like error rates, etc. Please see episodes learning.
newsletter learn better. can access HubermanLab.com. zero
cost newsletter. can grab PDF. lists things learning
about. Still try get excellent sleep. Again, fundamentally important mental health,
physical health, performance. can now extend performance saying
including learning memory. Nap doesn't interrupt nighttime sleep. Naps
anywhere 10 90 minutes. non-sleep deep rest protocols will enhance learning
memory, can now add that, spiking adrenaline provided can
done safe way, going reduce number repetitions required learn.
done tail end immediately learning about.
compatible protocols mentioned. reason revisiting
stuff sleep non-sleep deep rest think people got impression
need immediately learning today saying contrary.
Immediately learning need go heightened state emotionality
alertness. Now vitally important point not need pharmacology.
don't need caffeine. don't need Alpha GPC. don't need pharmacologic
substance spike adrenaline unless something already doing.
can safely. know can safely. always say, say
again, not physician not prescribing anything. professor, profess
things. need safe you. somebody not used
drinking caffeine suddenly drink four espresso trying learn something,


going severe increase alertness probably even anxiety.

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating

those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,

actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting

incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start

particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise

really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real

especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body

going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest

decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human

don't need caffeine. don't need Alpha GPC. don't need pharmacologic
substance spike adrenaline unless something already doing.
can safely. know can safely. always say, say
again, not physician not prescribing anything. professor, profess

clear, solid grounding research data, can confidently say spiking
adrenaline interacting material, physical cognitive material

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data
epinephrine release, better people remembered material.
shown. Whether not cognitive material, learning
language, learning passage words, learning mathematics. whether not
physical learning. want emphasize something physical learning
know number probably drinking cup coffee cup yerba
mate maybe even energy drink taking Alpha GPC something
physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work
matter, guest. think perfectly fine, provided safe you.
moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start
become afraid entire city blocks one bad thing happened particular room
particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise
specific nuanced every little detail. amygdala lumper
splitter comes sensory events. areas brain become
active very, specific conditions conditions. similarly,
epinephrine just molecule. just chemical circulating brain body.
no epinephrine specifically cold shower distinct epinephrine
associated bad event distinct epinephrine associated
really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real

especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin

going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest

decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data
epinephrine release, better people remembered material.

language, learning passage words, learning mathematics. whether not
physical learning. want emphasize something physical learning
know number probably drinking cup coffee cup yerba
mate maybe even energy drink taking Alpha GPC something
physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work
matter, guest. think perfectly fine, provided safe you.
moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start
become afraid entire city blocks one bad thing happened particular room
particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise
specific nuanced every little detail. amygdala lumper
splitter comes sensory events. areas brain become
active very, specific conditions conditions. similarly,
epinephrine just molecule. just chemical circulating brain body.
no epinephrine specifically cold shower distinct epinephrine
associated bad event distinct epinephrine associated
really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

01:08:42 Timing Adrenaline Release & Memory Formation

trying learn, going best time spike adrenaline. Now
realize bit redundant today perhaps lot redundant. repeating
increase epinephrine occur either late attempt learn
something immediately attempt learn something. also want emphasize
general contour pharmacologic effects behavioral tools create
adrenaline. mean sentence? mean McGaugh
colleagues explored huge number different compounds approaches. Everything
hand ice bath injecting adrenaline, caffeine, drugs block


affects adrenaline caffeine. Drugs like muscimol picrotoxin. Please don't take
those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh
Cahill beautiful experiments humans looking much adrenaline increased
varying emotional intensity different things trying get people
learn. changing dosage epinephrine. changing amount
epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small
increase epinephrine. can confidently say basis data
epinephrine release, better people remembered material.
shown. Whether not cognitive material, learning
language, learning passage words, learning mathematics. whether not
physical learning. want emphasize something physical learning
know number probably drinking cup coffee cup yerba
mate maybe even energy drink taking Alpha GPC something
physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work
matter, guest. think perfectly fine, provided safe you.
moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start
become afraid entire city blocks one bad thing happened particular room
particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise
specific nuanced every little detail. amygdala lumper
splitter comes sensory events. areas brain become
active very, specific conditions conditions. similarly,
epinephrine just molecule. just chemical circulating brain body.
no epinephrine specifically cold shower distinct epinephrine
associated bad event distinct epinephrine associated
really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one

moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood

increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin

going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise

neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,

sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human

those. drugs reduce enhance amount adrenaline overall
takeaway anything increases adrenaline will increase learning memory
will reduce number repetitions required learn something. Regardless
whether not something emotional intensity not. Provided spike
adrenaline occurs late learning immediately after. anything reduces
epinephrine adrenaline will impair learning. key novel piece
information adding now. taking beta blockers, instance.
trying learn something not evoking much emotional response,
not using pharmacology methods enhance adrenaline release
learning thing, well, not going learn well. fact, McGaugh

epinephrine blocker injected. Lots lots studies. key thing take
away studies people, adrenaline increased 600 700%.
six seven fold baseline amount circulating epinephrine adrenaline.
keep mind, sometimes increase due actual thing trying
learn emotional, positive negative emotion. sometimes
using pharmacologic approach ice bath approach. don't
think ever used cold shower approach, effective
one can sure. However, people zero 10% increase. small

physical learning. want emphasize something physical learning
know number probably drinking cup coffee cup yerba
mate maybe even energy drink taking Alpha GPC something
physical exercise. not saying bad thing wouldn't want that.
really increase alertness. won't enhance learning, least not well
things physical exercise. Now again, many you, including myself,
exercise sake physical benefits exercise. cardiovascular,
resistance training. not really focused learning memory. So,


emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work

moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start
become afraid entire city blocks one bad thing happened particular room
particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise
specific nuanced every little detail. amygdala lumper
splitter comes sensory events. areas brain become
active very, specific conditions conditions. similarly,
epinephrine just molecule. just chemical circulating brain body.
no epinephrine specifically cold shower distinct epinephrine
associated bad event distinct epinephrine associated
really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

emphasize just immensely clear everybody. want use
approaches increasing adrenaline prior physical training, cognitive work
matter, guest. think perfectly fine, provided safe you.
moving late learning really shifting

01:12:36 Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact Learning & Memory

role adrenaline increase enhancing memory specifically.
cautionary note, don't think can push entire system extreme
again, chronically, say, get away it. words, not
going able take Alpha GPC double espresso focus
work, cognitive physical work, spike adrenaline afterwards
remember stuff better, right. not encouraging you, fact
discouraging chronically increasing adrenaline given
work goal learn. say that? Well, work McGaugh
Cahill others shown not absolute amount adrenaline
release brain body matters enhancing memory. amount
adrenaline release relative amount adrenaline system just
prior. Particularly hour two prior. again, delta, say.
difference. going chronically increase adrenaline not going learn
well. real key adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just much
need order able focus something, pay attention it, spike
afterwards. immensely important much talking
actually form inducing neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning brief rapid
onset stress. Well, chronic stress, chronic elevation epinephrine cortisol
actually detrimental learning. entire category literature mainly
work great sadly late Bruce McEwen Rockefeller University.
scientific offspring like great Robert Sapolsky, showing chronic
stress, chronic elevation epinephrine actually inhibits learning memory. also
can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases adrenaline
cortisol actually can enhance learning indeed, can enhance immune
system. really want leverage information, might consider getting
brain body calm yet alert state. high attentional state
will allow focus trying learn. know focus vital


encoding information triggering neuroplasticity. remaining calm throughout
time afterwards spiking adrenaline allowing adrenaline
incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start
become afraid entire city blocks one bad thing happened particular room
particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise
specific nuanced every little detail. amygdala lumper
splitter comes sensory events. areas brain become
active very, specific conditions conditions. similarly,
epinephrine just molecule. just chemical circulating brain body.
no epinephrine specifically cold shower distinct epinephrine
associated bad event distinct epinephrine associated
really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts

incredible effects

01:15:12 Adrenaline Linked Learning: Not New Principle

reducing number repetitions required learn. like me,
learning information beautiful work McGaugh Cahill others
thinking, wow, perhaps consider spiking adrenaline one form another
tail end immediately following attempt learn something. yet, not
first conversation. McGaugh Cahill
researchers discussed today first start using technique. fact,
beautiful review published just year, May 2022 journal Neuron,
Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms Memory Stress.
just want read first opening paragraph review, is,
name suggests, memory stress. reading, quote, "In
Medieval times communities threw" "young children river when" "they wanted
remember important events." "They believed throwing child water" "after
witnessing historic proceedings" "would leave life long memory" "for events
child." Believe not, true. practice somehow people arrived at.
don't know aware adrenaline was. Probably not. somehow
medieval times understood spiking adrenaline creating robust emotional
experience experience one hoped child learn encourage
child's nervous system, didn't even know nervous system was,
encourage brain body child remember particular events.
counter intuitive ask me. thought kid remember
thrown river. guess remember that, idea
anyway, also remember things preceded thrown river.
interesting amusing somewhat, say thought stimulating, really.
practice going many hundreds years.
not first start thinking using cold water adrenaline stimulus.
first start thinking using cold water induced adrenaline

01:17:25 Amygdala, Adrenaline & Memory Formation, Generalization Memories



way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start
become afraid entire city blocks one bad thing happened particular room
particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise
specific nuanced every little detail. amygdala lumper
splitter comes sensory events. areas brain become
active very, specific conditions conditions. similarly,
epinephrine just molecule. just chemical circulating brain body.
no epinephrine specifically cold shower distinct epinephrine
associated bad event distinct epinephrine associated
really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one

Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical

impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

way enhance learning memory. happening since medieval
times. now talking pretty broad contour experiments.
talking underlying pharmacology, role epinephrine
forth. haven't really talked lot underlying neural mechanisms. just
going take minute two describe informative.
brain structure called amygdala. lot people think associated
fear actually associated threat detection generally,
say specifically, detecting sorts events environment
novel linked particular emotional states. positive emotional states
negative emotional states. neurons amygdala exquisitely good
figuring out, right, don't mind detecting correlations
sensory events environment trigger release adrenaline
going brain. amygdala extensively interconnected
areas brain. basically connects everything everything connects
back it. amygdala position strengthen particular connections brain
easily. Provided certain conditions met. conditions ones
talking now. Emotional saliency results increases
epinephrine cortisol. circulating epinephrine cortisol much higher
10 minutes 15 minutes before. net effect amygdala
context take whatever patterns neural activity preceded increase
adrenaline corticosterone strengthen synapses involved
neural activity. amygdala doesn't knowledge. not thinking area.
correlation detector. correlating neural chemical states brain body,
different patterns electrical activity brain. important really
emphasizes fact negative positive emotional states different
somewhat overlapping chemical states create, conditions, say
gates memory laid down. gates will familiar
done bit computer programming. gate simply condition
need one thing another happen order third thing happen.
need epinephrine elevated need robust activity particular brain
circuit fact brain circuit going strengthened. not sufficient one
other, need both. Hence, name gate. amygdala good
establishing gate contingencies. also generic brain structure


sense doesn't really care sorts sensory events involved provided
correlated time increase adrenal corticosterone.
wonderful side kind dark side. dark side PTSD traumas
various kinds often involve increase adrenaline whatever
caused PTSD indeed stressful. Caused big increases
chemicals. amygdala rather general functions. Right, not
tuned designed kind way specifically active response particular
types sensory events, perceptions. Well, means can start
become afraid entire city blocks one bad thing happened particular room
particular building city block. can become fearful anyplace contains
lot people something bad happened us place contained lot people.
amygdala not much splitter, say science. talk lumpers
splitters. Lumpers kind generalizers, even word. think is,
someone will tell one way other. splitters people ultra precise
specific nuanced every little detail. amygdala lumper
splitter comes sensory events. areas brain become
active very, specific conditions conditions. similarly,
epinephrine just molecule. just chemical circulating brain body.
no epinephrine specifically cold shower distinct epinephrine

really exciting event makes really alert. Epinephrine just molecule,
generic. systems lot overlap can explain, large part,
good things happen particular locations company particular people,
often generalize large categories people, places, things. negative
things happen

01:22:20 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Neurogenesis

particular circumstances, often generalize people places things
associated negative event. now like talk tools can
leverage shown quality, peer-reviewed studies enhance learning
memory. perhaps one potent tools exercise.
numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab


identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

numerous studies animals fortunately now also humans. Thanks
beautiful work people like Wendy Suzuki New York University. Wendy's lab

cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

identified exercise works enhance learning memory forms
cognition, mention. well things can augment, can enhance effects
exercise learning memory forms cognition. Wendy going
guest podcast. actually episode follows episode. includes
lot material not covered today. incredible scientist
incredible findings know everyone going find immensely useful.
meantime, want talk general effects exercise learning
memory discovered laboratories discovered.
recall earlier, mentioned learning memory almost always involves
strengthening particular synapses neural circuits brain. not much
increase number neurons brain. one exception, however.
now animal data human data support fact
cardiovascular exercise seems increase call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis creation new neurons. dentate gyrus subregion
hippocampus involved learning memory particular kinds. Right, certain
types events, particular contextual learning, things well. Sometimes
involved spacial learning. lot debate exactly dentate gyrus
does, sake discussion, think everyone neuroscience
community agree dentate gyrus important memory formation
consolidation. dentate gyrus seem one region brain, certainly
rodent brain, seeming also human brain least
new neurons added throughout lifespan. And, turns out,
cardiovascular exercise can increase proliferation new neurons structure.
new neurons, excuse me, important formation certain types
new memories. wonderful data showing use X-irradiation,
way eliminate formation new cells tools tricks
eliminate formation cells block formation certain kinds
learning memory. mean? Well, lot reasons
statement make extend far beyond neurogenesis hippocampus
learning memory. clear getting anywhere 180, say
minimum 180 200 minutes called zone two cardiovascular exercise,
cardiovascular exercise can performed pretty steady state
allow just barely hold conversation. breathing hard not super hard.
sprints high intensity interval training. 180 200 minutes per


week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich

recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability

snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise

neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

week total appears minimum threshold enhancing longevity
effects associated improvements cardiovascular fitness believe
indirectly, say indirectly, enhancements cardiovascular fitness
improvements hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
mean? improvements cardiovascular function indirectly impacting ability
dentate gyrus create new neurons. knowledge no direct
relationship exercise stimulating production new neurons
brain. seems improvement blood flow also relate improvements
things like lymphatic flow, circulation lymph fluid within brain
enhancing neurogenesis neurogenesis, appears important. Now fairness
landscape neuroscience colleagues Stanford elsewhere.
lot debate whether not much neurogenesis adult
human brain. regardless, think data quite clear 180 200 minutes
minimum cardiovascular exercise going important health metrics.
Now clear exercise can impact learning

01:27:00 Cardiovascular Exercise, Osteocalcin & Improved Hippocampal Function

memory non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. one
exciting ones studied years notion hormones
bone traveling blood stream brain enhancing function
hippocampus. words hormones bones surprising you, tell
yes, indeed, bones make hormones. call endocrine effects.
biology hear autocrine, paracrine, endocrine. different terms refer
distance given chemical affect cell. instance, cell can
affect itself. can affect immediately neighboring cells can
affect itself, immediately neighboring cells cells far, far away
body. last example given chemical substance affect
cell produced plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away endocrine effect.
lot hormones, not all, work fashion. Hence sometimes hear
endocrine hormone kind synonymous terms. bones make
chemicals travel blood stream endocrine effects.
effectively acting hormones. one chemical something called osteocalcin.
Now findings arrived us various labs one important labs


sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

sake discussion today laboratory Eric Kandel Columbia Medical
School. Eric now, believe mid late 90s, still sharp. studied
learning memory. also turns avid swimmer. Now, happen
know Eric swims anywhere half mile mile day. again,
anecdotal. not referring published data just yet. credits exercise
one ways keeps brain sharp indeed kept brain sharp
many, many decades. mentioned before, well 90s. pretty
impressive. laboratory studied effects exercise hippocampal function
memory. laboratories done well. found
cardiovascular exercise perhaps forms exercise too, mainly
cardiovascular exercise creates release osteocalcin bones travels
brain sub regions hippocampus encourages electrical activity
formation maintenance connections within hippocampus keeps
hippocampus functioning well order lay new memories. Now osteocalcin
lot effects besides just improving function hippocampus. Osteocalcin
involved bone growth itself. involved hormone regulation. fact, really
nice evidence can regulate testosterone estrogen production testes
ovaries. bunch effects organs body. again,
acting endocrine manner. arriving bone lot

01:29:59 Load-Bearing Exercise, Osteocalcin & Cognitive Ability

different organs effects. Load bearing exercise, particular, turns
important inducing release osteocalcin. think this,
makes sense. nervous system exists lot reasons, sense, perceive, etc.
got taste, got smell, got hearing. vast majority brain real
estate, especially humans, dedicated two things. One, vision.
enormous amount brain real estate devoted vision. Certainly compared
senses. movement. ability generate course movements body.
ability, excuse me, generate fine movements body, like digits, wink one
eye, tilt head particular way, move lips move face
sorts different things nuanced detailed way. much brain real
estate devoted movement hypothesized half century,
especially recent years learned function brain


really detailed circuit level, relationship brain body
maintenance perhaps even improvement neural circuitry brain
depends body movements signal body brain still
moving. think that. brain know body moving
regularly know much moving? know
limbs moving? Well, say, heart rate increased blood
flow will increased brain will know. Ah, brain know
increased blood flow due movement not to, instance, just stress, right?
Maybe actually can't move stressed increased
blood flow simply consequence increased stress. fact osteocalcin
released bone particular can released response load bearing
exercise. running, weightlifting hasn't tested directly,
one imagine anything involves jumping landing, weightlifting, body
weight movements things sort. signal release osteocalcin,
know signal occurs. directly reflective fact body moving
moving particular ways. fact, imagine big bones like femur
going release osteocalcin position release osteocalcin
fine movements like movements digits. idea body
constantly signaling brain status body varying needs
brain update brain circuitry, really attractive idea fits entirely
biology exercise, osteocalcin, hippocampal function. want mention
not first raise hypothesis. hypothesis actually discussed fair
amount detail John Ratey professor Harvard Medical School. wrote
book called, "Spark" one early books least academic
brain plasticity relationship exercise movement plasticity.
John, good fortune know, described experiments,
say observations species ocean dwelling animals have, least
early part life, robust complicated nervous system.
particular animals habit plopping unto rock. find kind safe,
comfy space actually stick rock don't move anymore
certain portion, say later portion life. transition
moving lot stationary animals actually digest
brain. literally metabolize good portion nervous system
decide, oh, don't need anymore. gobble up, use nutritional value


sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give
message just moving, just exercise, sufficient keep neural architecture
brain healthy, young, able learn. might true, also important
actually engage attempts learn new material. Either physical material, new
types movements skills new types cognitive information. Languages,
mathematics, history, current events. sorts things involve brain.
Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential
enhance cognitive ability ability learn new physical skills intimately
connected. osteocalcin appears least one way

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either

mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding

situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

sit like moron version limited amount brain tissue
don't need move anymore. Now, certainly don't want give

Nonetheless, clear physical movement cognitive ability potential

01:34:41 Tool: Timing Exercise, Learning & Memory Enhancement

brain-body relationship established maintained. given
information osteocalcin movement, given information spiking
adrenaline late period attempt learn, might asking
best time exercise? Now unfortunately, not addressed lot varying
detail, every sort variation theme carried out. yet, Wendy
Suzuki's lab done really beautiful experiments people exercise,
generally morning. periods day well.
find least late two hours exercise, enhancement
learning memory. Now want clear, don't know whether not
exercise led big increases adrenaline. may forms exercise
modest enough, didn't challenge people enough merely got lot blood
flow going improvements learning memory related blood flow
presume increases osteocalcin. However, imagine couple
different logical protocols based talked about. say going
form exercise going spike adrenaline lot. exercise
really challenges system forces kind push burn. Right,
mainly thinking cardiovascular exercise. even yoga,
resistance training. going give big spike adrenaline, going
take serious effort, logically speaking want place
learning order increase learning memory. However, using
exercise order enhance blood flow enhance osteocalcin release. efforts


augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

augment function hippocampus, think stands reason
exercise sometime within hour three hours preceding attempt learn makes
lot sense. basing human data Wendy Suzuki's lab.
basing studies Eric Kandel others labs. Again, right now,
hasn't evaluation lot different protocols arrive peer-reviewed
laboratory super protocol. However, since talking using activities like
exercise us probably, perhaps us, regularly anyway.
believe not us regularly trying learn keep
brain functioning well acquire new knowledge. just wonderful part
life. evidence actually can keep brain young, speak. Well
then, exercising either learning makes lot sense.
emphasis learning

01:37:29 Photographic Memory

form exercise spikes lot adrenaline reasons talked
before. Okay, talked two major categories protocols improve
memory grounded quality, peer reviewed science. yet another
third protocol talk minutes. that, want
briefly touch aspect memory, fact, two aspects memory get lot
questions about. first one photographic memory. clear, people
true photographic memory. can look page text, can
scan eyes, can essentially commit memory little
effort. might seem photographic memory attractive
skill have, caution believing turns people
true photographic memory often challenged remembering things
hear. often times not good learning physical skills. not always
case, often case. careful wish for.
photographic memory certain professions lend particularly well
you. indeed lot people photographic memory find profession
move life way concert photographic memory.
again, super ability, hyper ability yet not necessarily one
desirable people.



01:38:49 “Super Recognizers,” Facial Recognition

also category called super recognizers. people are,
mention, highly employable government agencies. people
absolutely astonishing ability recognize faces match faces templates.
can look photograph say somebody wanted list can
look video footage say airport, mall, city street fairly low
resolution can spot person face matches photograph
looked at. Even video footage people's profiles even tops
heads just portion forehead. people just incredible
ability recognize faces template match. again, people often will take
jobs agencies sort thing important. probably
super recognizers may may not notice it. ever experience
watching movie thought yourself, wow, mouth looks much like
cousin's mouth. look character movie television show think,
wow, look almost like younger sister so. Well, likely
this, least mild form super recognizer ability. not memory
per se. hyper functioning area brain call fusiform
gyrus. fusiform gyrus literally face recognition area, face template
matching area. harbors neurons respond faces generally. humans
non-human primates, care lot faces emotional content.
identity faces super important us kinds reasons
probably obvious. Knowing friend, foe. know well?
famous, not famous? Etc. not memory, per se. yet, super
recognizer, guess call moderate face recognizer not good
recognizing faces indeed, people kind face blind.
don't actually recognize people walk room. used work
somebody like this. walk office say, Rich
Andrew? say, well rich, rich. Like, know, wealth rich? No.
say, no, Richard Andrew? say, Andrew. know
really well. say, oh sorry. kind face blind. actually tended
better worse depending much working. Ironically,
rested face blind become. wasn't sleep deprivation
thing. exists, there. full constellation people's ability


recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

01:49:12 Déjà Vu



course, vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion memory
complete without discussion ever intriguing phenomenon known deja vu.
sense experienced something can't quite put finger
it. happen? sense someplace before.
familiar state place context kind. Now, talked
podcast before, least, think have. way works
defined largely wonderful work Susumu Tonegawa Massachusetts Institute
Technology, MIT. Susumu collected Nobel Prize, quite appropriately,
beautiful work immunology. also highly accomplished neuroscientist
studies memory learning deja vu. also mention beautiful work
Mark Mayford Scripps Institute UC San Diego. Beautiful work notion
deja vu. discovered. evaluated patterns neural firing
hippocampus subjects learn new things. Okay, neuron fires, neuron B
fires, neuron C fires particular sequence. Again, firing neurons
particular sequence like playing keys piano particular sequence leads
particular song piano leads particular memory experience within
brain. used molecular tools tricks label capture
neurons go back later activate neurons either
sequence different sequence one occurred formation
memory. make long story short, summarize multiple papers published
incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature Science extremely
stringent, found whether not particular neurons played precise
sequence happened encoded memory whether not
neurons played different sequence, even neurons played,
activated is, no temporal sequence. firing concert once,
evoked behavior. sense, memory. neural circuit
level, deja vu. different pattern firing neurons brain leading
sense happened, leading particular emotional state behavior.
Whether not sort phenomenon occurs walking
street suddenly feel if, wow, feel like before. meet
someone feel like, gosh feel like know you. feel like familiarity
can't quite put finger on. don't know sure happening
mechanistic logical explanation many decades,


not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

recognize faces. not really memory. yet, visual function profoundly
powerful way can enhance memories. whether not super
recognizer faces,

01:41:46 Tool: Mental Snapshots, Photographs & Memory Enhancement

whether not face blind anything between. Next going tell
study points immense value visual images laying memories.
can leverage information involves taking photographs,
something quite easily done days phone. well ability
take mental photographs literally snapping eyelids shut. just briefly want
describe paper provides tool can leverage attempt
learn remember things better. title paper Photographic Memory,
Effects Volitional Photo-Taking Memory Visual Auditory Aspects
Experience. really like paper refers photographic memory not
context photographic memory normally hear people truly
photographic, look page somehow absorb information commit
memory. rather use camera photographs use mental camera
photographs. Literally looking something deciding, blink, snapping a, speak,
snapping snapshot whatever looking remembering
content. reason like paper reason attracted issue mental
snapshots something since kid. don't know
started it, every while, say maybe twice year look
something decide just snap mental snapshot it. maintained
clear memories visual scenes. Two years ago Uber looked
window street scene. actually New York time
decided reasons still unclear me, take mental snapshot city
street image. Even though nothing interesting particular happening.
recall guy wearing yellow shirt walking, construction,
etc. can still see image mind's eye took mental snapshot.
paper addresses whether not mental snapshotting thing real
something think lot people will resonate with, whether not constant taking
pictures phones devices either improving degrading
memory. imagine argument both. lot people taking pictures


never look again. sense, outsourcing visual memory
events phone device not ever accessing actual
image again. not looking it, right? not printing photos.
not scanning phone again. Sometimes might that,
time people don't. photographs people taking not revisiting again.
motivation study previous experiments shown people
take photos scene person, object, actually less good
remembering details scene object, etc. study challenged idea
raised hypothesis people allowed choose take photos of,
taking photos, again, camera, not mental snapshotting. taking
photos actually enhance memory objects, places,
people, fact, details objects, places, people. indeed,
found. contrast previous studies people less told,
take photos following objects, following people, following
places given memory test point later. study people
given volitional control, right? given agency making decision
take photos of. just summarize results. provide link
study. say stuff tested actually pretty challenging.
pottery forms ceramics sort see
go big museum big city. ever done that, see
different objects, lot details objects lot objects look
lot alike. someone will two handles. will one handle.
position handles. broad narrow things are. know, lot
pretty detailed stuff. also took photos things. basically found
people take pictures things choose things taking
pictures of, right. them, volitional. enhanced memory
objects later on. However, degraded ability remember auditory information.
means take picture something, person,
stamping visual memory thing. makes sense, photograph
all. actually inhibiting ability remember auditory, sound
component visual scene person saying. interesting.
points fact visual system can compete auditory system, least
terms hippocampus encoding information. finding find
particularly interesting within study didn't matter whether not ever


looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
accesses increase adrenaline. Again, can done behavioral
protocols pharmacology. Assuming behavioral protocols
pharmacology safe you, really doesn't matter evoke adrenaline
release remember, adrenaline final common pathway particular
experiences, particular perceptions stamped memory. answers
first question raised beginning episode. is, remember
anything all? Right, question raised. morning
'til night throughout entire life tons sensory experience, tons
perceptions. remembered others not?
never want distill important question one molecule type
answer, think can confidently say based vast amount animal human
research data epinephrine, adrenaline, chemicals acts
concert, fact, way remember particular events

looked photos again. actually people take photos, not take photos
different objects. people keep photos people
delete photos. turns whether not people kept photos deleted
photos no bearing whether not better worse
remembering things. always better remembering compared not
taking photos them. mean? means really want
remember something somebody, take photo thing person. Pay attention
take photo. doesn't really matter look photo again.
Somehow process taking photo, probably looking it. know, camera
typically say viewfinder now digital cameras
screen back camera, phone, framing photograph
stamps visual image mind robust serving memory
just looked thing eyes. interesting raises
sorts questions whether not framing small
aperture small portion visual scene. one logical interpretation, although
didn't test that. also say found whether not looked
photo took, whether not deleted never looked again,
didn't just enhance visual memory memory visual components
image always reduced ability remember sounds associated
experience. interesting. last not least, perhaps
interesting, least me, fact didn't even need camera see
effect. subjects looked something took mental photograph thing,
enhanced visual memory thing significantly not taken
mental picture. fact, increased memory thing almost much taking
actual photograph actual camera. reason find interesting
lot try learn visual. lot people, ability learn
visual information feels challenging. look something try create
detailed understanding it. try understand relationships
things scene. appear based study mere decision take
mental snapshot, like, okay going blink eyelids going take
snapshot whatever see, can actually stamp visual memory much
way camera can stamp visual memory.

not hundreds years, described deja vu.
experience deja vu often, just know reflects normal pattern encoding
experiences events within hippocampus. not aware pathological
situations presence deja vu inhibits daily life. people like
sensation deja vu. people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes
somewhat eerie. idea even though different place, even though
interacting different person, somehow feel
happened before. just realize this, hippocampus, exquisitely
good encoding new types perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new
contingencies relationships life events, not infinitely large
infinite bucket full different options different sequences neurons play.
lot ways makes perfect sense sometimes feel

01:53:24 Tool: Meditation, Daily Timing Meditation

given experience happened previously. like cover one additional tool
can use improve learning memory. mention, particularly
powerful one one definitely going employ myself. based
paper none Wendy Suzuki New York University. talked
little bit earlier. again, going podcast next episode.
just incredible researcher. known Wendy number years
last, say five six years really shifted laboratory toward
generating protocols human beings can use. putting great effect,
great positive effect say. Publishing papers sort describe.
also incorporating tools protocols learning curriculum
lifestyle curriculum students NYU. think terrific initiative.
don't need NYU student order benefit work. going tell
work now tell much episode
follows one. title paper will tell lot going.
title Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, Emotional
Regulation Non-Experienced Meditators. ever incentive meditate,
data contained within paper. want briefly describe study also
want emphasize meditate absolutely critical. talk just
end. study involves subjects aged 18 45. None


experienced mediators prior study. two general groups study.
One group 13 minute long meditation meditation fairly conventional
meditation. sit lie down. somewhat body scan,
evaluating instance tense relaxed felt throughout body
focus breathing. Trying bring attention back breathing
state body meditation progressed. group, can
call control group listened things, podcast. not listen
podcast. listened Radio Lab, popular podcast, equivalent
amount time. not instructed kind body scan pay attention
breathing. Every subject study either meditated daily listened
equivalent duration podcast daily period eight weeks. experimenters
measured large number things, variables, say. looked measures
emotion regulation. actually measured cortisol, stress hormone. measured,
title suggests, attention memory forth. basic takeaway
study eight weeks not four weeks daily 13 minute day mediation
significant effect improving attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation. find
study interesting fact, important us heard
positive effects meditation things like stress reduction. things
improving sleep. want come back sleep moments turns
important feature study. particular study like much
used really broad array measurements cognitive function. Things
like Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. not going go this. Things like Stroop
Task also, mentioned, measured cortisol. many things,
including, not surprisingly, memory. people's ability remember certain types
information, fact varied types information. basic takeaway was, again,
get really robust improvements learning memory, mood attention
just 13 minutes day meditation. Now important twist study
want emphasize. read discussion study mentioned
somehow meditation not improve actually impaired sleep quality compared
control subjects. might think, wow, be? mean, meditation
supposed reduce stress. Stress supposed inhibit sleep. therefore
sleep get worse? Well, interesting time day
subjects tended meditation. subjects study
meditation late day. often case experiments. know


run experiments human subjects laboratory people paid
amount money order participate given something compensation
study. often times meditation, case lab,
respiration work kinds things assigned not top, top
priority. understand this. study, majority subjects
reading completed meditation sessions somewhere 8:00 11:00
P.M. sometimes even 12:00 3:00 A.M. think probably lot
college students enrolled study. hours often late shifted.
impaired sleep. raises bigger theme think important. Many times
podcast certainly episode mastering sleep conquering
mastering stress episodes talked value, again, non-sleep
deep rest protocols, NSDR, reducing activity sympathetic nervous system.
alertness, so-called stress arm autonomic nervous system. one
makes feel really alert. NSDR superb reducing level alertness,
increasing level calmness, putting so-called
parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation too, also increases attention.
think meditation, meditation involves focusing breath constantly
focusing back breath trying avoid distraction things thinking
things hearing. coming, so-called, back body, back
breath. meditation actually, high attentional load. requires lot
prefrontal cortical activity involved attention. logically relates one
outcomes study attention ability improved daily
meditators. also points increasing level attention activity
prefrontal cortex may, want emphasize may, speculating
underlying mechanism, inhibit ability fall asleep. meditation
one hand tend put us calm state calm, focused
state. fact, attention focus inherent forms meditation. Non-sleep
deep rest, Yoga Nidra know be. NSDR, terrific
NSDR script available free online put Madefor. can go
YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. can also go search NSDR. number
available there, again, no cost. NSDR protocols tend put people
state deep relaxation also low attention. assume
low activation prefrontal cortex. takeaways study several fold.
First all, daily meditation 13 minutes can enhance ability pay attention


learn. can truly enhance memory. However, need least
eight weeks order start see effects occur presume
continue meditation training sessions. fact, found people
four weeks meditation effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might
seem like long time, think 13 minutes day not actually big time
commitment. results study certainly incentivize start adopting a,
going 15 minutes day now. off meditator number years.
pretty good lately, confess far shorter meditations
anywhere three five, maybe 10 minutes. going ramp 15
minutes day. specifically try access improvements
cognitive ability abilities learn. Also based data paper, going
meditation sessions either early day, immediately
waking, close it. might get sunshine first. I'm, know, big
getting sunlight eyes early day. much one can early one
can. sun out. certainly early day not past 5:00 P.M.
order make sure don't inhibit sleep. think this, result
describe meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared controls important one

02:02:21 Enhance Memory

pay attention to. No pun intended. Today covered lot aspects memory
improve memory. talked different forms memory
talked underlying neural circuitry memory formation talked
emotional saliency intensity trying learn profound
impact whether not learn response sort experience. Whether
not experience reading, mathematics, music, language, physical skill.
doesn't matter. intense emotional state period
immediately following learning, likely remember whatever
trying learn. talked neuro chemicals explain
effect. epinephrine corticosterones like cortisol. adjusting timing
key enhancing memory. talked different ways
enhance chemicals. Everything ranging cold water pharmacology
even just adjusting emotional state within mind order stamp
remember experiences better. also talked leverage exercise,


particular, load bearing exercise order evoke release hormones like
osteocalcin can travel bones brain enhance ability
learn. talked new form photographic memory. Not traditional type
photographic memory people can remember everything look
easily. rather, taking mental snapshots things see. Again, emphasizing
will create better memory see take mental snapshot,
will actually reduce memory things hear moment.
discussed really exciting data looking particular meditation protocols can
enhance memory also attention mood. However, done late day, can
actually disrupt sleep precisely meditation protocols can enhance
attention. Now know many interested neuro chemicals can
enhance learning memory. intend cover deep detail future
episode. However, sake discussed today, please understand
number different neuro chemicals can evoke can increase amount
adrenaline circulating brain body. less important one
