little bit scientific history. whole basis neuroplasticity

27:10 Fathers Neuroplasticity/Critical Periods

essentially ascribed two individuals, although lot people
involved work. two individuals go name David Hubel
Torsten Wiesel. David Hubel Torsten Wiesel started off Johns Hopkins, moved
Harvard medical school. seventies eighties, series
experiments, recording electrical activity brain. visual cortex,
meaning put electrodes visual cortex, exploring vision
works visual brain organizes features visual world give us
incredible things call visual perceptions. Hubel physician.
interested happens instance, child comes world


cataract, lens eye, isn't clear opaque. kid
lazy eye eyes called strabismus, eyes either
deviate outward inward. common things childhood, especially
particular areas world. David Torsten figured
critical period clear vision not occur, visual brain
completely rewire itself, basically represent whatever bit visual information
coming in. experiments kind simulate droopy eye deviating
eye close one eyelid found visual brain
respond entirely open eye. sort takeover visual brain
representing open eye. Many experiments many different sensory systems
followed this. beautiful experiments instance, Gregg
Recanzone's lab UC Davis Mike Merzenich's lab UCSF showing
instance two fingers taped together early development, weren't moving
independently, representation two fingers become fused brain
person couldn't actually distinguish movements sensations
two fingers separately, pretty remarkable. say David Torsten's

not just trying get, trying give up. can't actually
add new connections without removing something else. might seem like kind
stinger actually turns great advantage. One key experiments
David Torsten experiment closed eyes,
essentially removed visual input early development. Now slightly different
blindness transient, short period time.
found no change. However, close just
one eye huge change. people tell you, oh end today's


lecture, end something brain going completely different,
simply not true. older 25 brain will not change unless
selective shift attention selective shift experience tells brain
time change. changes occur ways talked
strengthening weakening particular connections, names like long-term

way, spike-timing-dependent plasticity. threw names not confuse
you, like in-depth exploration those, please
can go google look up, great Wikipedia pages
can go paper trail. might even touch subsequent
episodes. important thing understand want something change,
really need bring immense amount attention whatever want
change. much linked statement made earlier about, starts
awareness. Now, attention important? Well, David Torsten won
Nobel prize certainly deserved it. probably deserved two
also figured vision works. might biased 'cause scientific
great-grandparents think everybody field Neuroscience agrees Hubel
Wiesel, called H&W game, absolutely deserved Nobel
prize work really unveiled mechanisms brain change
plasticity. David passed away years ago, Torsten still alive, late 90s,
still Rockefeller university. sharp tack. still jogs several miles
day. really art number things. also super nice guy. Hubel
really nice guy well, also great Frisbee player discovered 'cause
beat game ultimate like 80, still, little bit irked.
anyway, Hubel Wiesel amazing thing science will forever change

32:30 Correcting Errors History

way think brain. However, quite wrong critical

Epinephrin released region brainstem called locus coeruleus. Fancy
name, don't need know unless want to. Locus coeruleus sends
little wires call axons hoses entire brain essentially
neurochemical, epinephrin. Now not always hosing brain epinephrin.
high states alertness epinephrin released. way
circuit designed, nonspecific. essentially waking entire brain
way epinephrin works binding particular receptors
increase likelihood neurons will active. no alertness, no neuroplasticity.
However, alertness alone not sufficient. say, necessary not
sufficient neuroplasticity. know true also work Hubel Wiesel
looked brain plasticity response certain experiences subjects

40:18 Acetylcholine Spotlight

important thing getting plasticity there'll epinephrin
equates alertness, plus release neuromodulator, acetylcholine. Now
acetylcholine released two sites brain. One also brainstem

principles get depth focus. want briefly talk pharmacology first
always get asked this. People say, "What can take increase

terms acetylcholine sport mental acuity, not just plasticity. Now
you, probably don't want chew Nicorette, definitely don't want smoke cigarettes
take supplements increasing acetylcholine. ways can
increase acetylcholine? there, going sound like bit circular argument
increase focus.

53:30 Focus

increase focus? know, people familiar sitting down, reading
couple pages book realizing none sunk talking someone
seeing mouth move, maybe even nodding head subconsciously none
sinks in. can damaging school, work performance relationships
many know. Costello incidentally never seems pay attention anything say
looking directly me, contradicts say,
best way get better focusing use mechanisms focus born
with. key principle mental focus follows visual focus.
familiar fact visual system can unfocused, blurry jumping around
can laser focused one location space. interesting vitally
important understanding access neuroplasticity can use visual
focus can increase visual focus way increasing mental focus
abilities broadly. going explain that. Plasticity starts
alertness. mentioned before, alertness can come sense love,
sense joy, sense fear, doesn't matter. pharmacologic ways access
alertness too. common one course caffeine watch sleep
episodes, know reduces molecule makes us sleepy called adenosine.
drink plenty caffeine. heavy user caffeine. don't think abuser caffeine.
think reasonable amounts provided can still fall asleep night, caffeine can
relatively safe way

55:22 Adderall: Use & Abuse

increase epinephrin. Now, many people now also using Adderall. Adderall
chemically looks lot like amphetamine basically amphetamine. will increase
epinephrin release locus coeruleus, will wake brain lot


people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes
prescribed attention deficit. However, also high probability abuse
especially not prescribed it. Adderall will not increase focus,
increases alertness. not touch acetylcholine system.
taking Adderall say, "Well, really increases focus overall", probably
autonomic nervous system just veering towards call
parasympathetic. really just sleepy bringing levels
alertness up. mentioned, Adderall problematic number people
can habit forming. Learning Adderall not always translate high-
performance off Adderall later times. Adderall discussion broader
one perhaps psychiatrist room point
widely abused drug point time.

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog

Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual

1:13:30 Real Change Occurs



Feel free blink, course, can greatly increase powers focus

actively unlearn it. will talk unlearning later episode. mastering
sleep key order reinforce learning occurs. say get really
poor night sleep learning. Chances are, sleep next night
following night learning will occur. stamp brain

metabolically, synopses biased change. Now, don't
ever get deep sleep probably won't get changes. also way
can bypass need deep sleep least partially engaging
call Non Sleep Deep Rest, NSDR protocols. just want discuss signs
this. paper published Cell Reports last year shows
people did, spatial memory task, actually quite difficult one
remember sequence lights lighting just two three lights

learning actual performance task, people took 20 minute Non Sleep
Deep Rest protocol took shallow nap, lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,
just closing eyes, no sensory input, rates learning significantly higher

can actually accelerate learning NSDR protocols brief naps, 90
minutes less. key plasticity childhood child.

1:16:20 Much Learning Enough?



key plasticity adulthood engage alertness, engage focus
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest deep sleep typical sleep.
always get asked, "How many bouts learning can perform?" Well, know people
train visual focus mechanisms point can several 90
minute bouts throughout day, many three four. also
inserting Non Sleep Deep Rest well. Now can get pretty tricky.

1:16:50 Learning (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift

including Cell Reports paper mentioned moments ago. want
synthesize information covered now. entire month


neuroplasticity. Today's episode covered lot, no means
covered potential neuroplasticity protocols plasticity. will get
it. today want make sure key elements form backbone
neuroplasticity really embedded people's minds. First all, plasticity occurs
throughout lifespan. Early, birth 25, mere exposure sensory event can
create plasticity. good thing bad thing. going talk
unlearning bad stuff, traumas, et cetera subsequent episode month.
want learn adult, alert. might seem obvious think lot
people don't think 24 hour cycle, alert. four
episodes devoted 24-hour cycle cycles alertness sleep.
encourage listen haven't opportunity yet just ask
day typically tend alert? will afford
advantage learning specific things period time. don't give

That'd terrible time get passive observance just letting time get
soaked away something. valuable asset, epinephrin, released

others, waking phase course. know are.
start think behavioral practices, maybe pharmacologic
practices like caffeine, hydration, et cetera will support heightened levels
alertness. Attention something can learned attention critical creating
condition whatever engaging will modify brain

really want somebody listen really hear saying
underlying it, not, cannot expect look directly
that. actually going limit ability focus. trying rescue folks
might struggle. course never struggle.
supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus
entire period one 90-minute cycle. beginning end going little bit
flickering focus. know one 90-minute cycles
starting, typically wake os beginning first 90-minute cycle,


not minute. able tap sense 90-minute
cycles start engage learning practices choose.
course getting non sleep deep rest just deliberate disengagement,
walking running, just sitting, eyes closed eyes open kind mindlessly
might seem chair, just letting thoughts move around learning will
accelerate rate plasticity shown quality peer reviewed studies.
course, deep sleep. can start see plasticity

reflexive actions no longer fated reflexive. Now sounds little bit
abstract, going talk protocols this. first step
neuroplasticity recognizing want change something
immediately say, well, kids don't go school say, oh, want learn language
want learn social interactions, beauty childhood. whole brain

27:10 Fathers Neuroplasticity/Critical Periods

essentially ascribed two individuals, although lot people
involved work. two individuals go name David Hubel
Torsten Wiesel. David Hubel Torsten Wiesel started off Johns Hopkins, moved

particular areas world. David Torsten figured
critical period clear vision not occur, visual brain
completely rewire itself, basically represent whatever bit visual information
coming in. experiments kind simulate droopy eye deviating
eye close one eyelid found visual brain
respond entirely open eye. sort takeover visual brain
representing open eye. Many experiments many different sensory systems
followed this. beautiful experiments instance, Gregg
Recanzone's lab UC Davis Mike Merzenich's lab UCSF showing
instance two fingers taped together early development, weren't moving
independently, representation two fingers become fused brain
person couldn't actually distinguish movements sensations
two fingers separately, pretty remarkable. say David Torsten's

David Torsten experiment closed eyes,
essentially removed visual input early development. Now slightly different

way epinephrin works binding particular receptors
increase likelihood neurons will active. no alertness, no neuroplasticity.
However, alertness alone not sufficient. say, necessary not

people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog
bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused

long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long

nervous system designed not plastic. wired plasticity
changes circuits unlikely. circuits include things like, ones
control heartbeat, ones control breathing, ones control
digestion, thank goodness circuits set way
want circuits extremely reliable. never want think
whether not heart will beat whether not will continue breathing
whether not able digest food. many nervous system features like
digestion breathing heart rate hard change. aspects nervous
system actually quite easy change. one great gifts childhood,
adolescence young adulthood, can learn almost passive
experience. don't focus hard order learn new things. fact,
children go able speak no language whatsoever able speak
many many words comprise sentences including words never heard
remarkable. means portions brain involved speech

10:25 Everything Changes 25

tells us young brain plasticity machine. right age
25 plus minus year two, everything changes. age 25 so, order get
changes nervous system, engage completely different set
processes order get changes occur importantly stick
around. something think vastly overlooked popular culture
discussion neuroplasticity. People always talk fire together, wire together.
Fire together wire together true. statement colleague Stanford, Carla
Shatz absolute truth way nervous system wires early
development. But, fire together wire together doesn't apply way age 25.
little memes little quotes that, know circulate
internet like fire together, wire together famous quote greatest
neurobiologist time, Ram√≥n y Cajal. think goes something like, know
somebody wish change nervous system sculptor
nervous system way want, something like that. sounds great.
mean, wouldn't want change nervous system way want,
lost statements actually accomplish that. going cover


today please understand early development nervous system

enjoy. want talk nervous system changes. changes?
Many us captivated

13:10 New Neuron Myth

stories popular press addition new neurons. idea, oh,
go running exercise, brain actually makes new neurons. Well, going
give bad news first that, puberty, age 14 15,
human brain nervous system adds new neurons. idea
new neurons added brain one rich history experimental
science. clear rodents non-human primates new neurons,
process called neurogenesis, can occur areas brain, olfactory bulb,
course involved smell well region hippocampus, center
brain involved memory called dentate gyrus hippocampus.
strong evidence new neurons can added structures throughout
lifespan. humans, evidence little bit controversial.



14:10 Anosmia: Losing Smell

clear can add new neurons olfactory bulb. fact,
ever unfortunate experience hit head hard, wires called
axons olfactory neurons live nose can get sheared off
pass bony plate called cribriform plate. cribriform
plate can shear axons people can become called anosmic, won't
able smell. time, neurons unlike central nervous system
neurons can grow connections back even reestablish new neurons
added olfactory bulb. come elsewhere deep brain
migrate pathway called rostral migratory stream. can Google
words look descriptions like learn more. indeed
evidence neurons responsible smell can replaced
throughout lifespan. Certainly, young individuals birth till age 15
so. Whether not new neurons added hippocampus,

15:13 Neuronal Birthdays Near Death Day

memory center human brain isn't clear. Many years ago, Rusty Gage's lab
Salk Institute really important study looking terminally ill cancer patients
injecting label, dye incorporated new neurons.
patients died, brains harvested. brains looked
new neurons there, evidence new neurons. results think
stand time not really discussed popular press discussion
around papers cells added.
number papers come along years mainly labs UCSF, although
others well, showing new neurons added adult brain,
infinitesimally small number new neurons. depressing part, don't
get new neurons. born, pretty much neurons going
use entire life. yes, get older start lose certain functions
brain, lose neurons. not lost, speak, ways
neurocircuits can create new connections add new functions including new
memory, new abilities new cognitive functions. mainly


process making certain connections, course things call
synapses, neurons making connections stronger.
reliable, likely engage

16:45 Circumstances Brain Change

well removing connections. removal connections vital say moving
grieving process removing emotional load traumatic experience.
even though can't add new neurons throughout lifespan, least not great
numbers, clear can change nervous system, nervous system
available change, create right set circumstances brain,
chemical circumstances, create right environmental circumstances around
us, nervous system will shift mode

17:21 Brain Space

change isn't just possible probable. mentioned before, hallmark
child nervous system change, wants change. whole thing, everything
chemicals sloshing around fact lot space
neurons. lot people don't know this, early development lot
space neurons. neurons can literally move around sample
different connections easily removing keeping others. get older,
so-called extracellular space actually filled things called extracellular matrix
glial cells. Glial means glue. cells involved bunch different
processes start fill space kind like pouring concrete
rocks. happens, becomes much harder change connections
there. One ways can get plasticity stage throughout
lifespan deficits impairments call sensory apparati,
eyes, ears, nose, mouth, dramatic somewhat
tragic examples people, instance genetic mutations born
without nose

18:30 No Nose, Eyes, Ears



without olfactory structures brain cannot smell. case areas
brain normally represent smell become overtaken areas brain
involved things like touch hearing sight. individuals blind
birth, so-called occipital cortex, visual cortex back, becomes
overtaken hearing. neurons will start respond sounds well braille
touch. actually one particularly tragic incident woman
blind since birth neuroimaging studies, knew visual cortex
no longer visual, responsible braille reading hearing, stroke
actually took function visual cortex. blind,
couldn't braille read hear. recover aspect function. Now,
people don't end highly unfortunate situation. know
instance,

19:30 Enhanced Hearing Touch Blind

blind people use visual cortex braille reading hearing, much
better auditory acuity touch acuity. Meaning can sense things fingers
can sense things hearing typical sighted folks wouldn't able to.
fact, will find much greater incidence perfect pitch people blind.
tells us brain particular area call neocortex,
outer part, really designed map individual experience. these,
call experiments impairment loss somebody blind birth deaf

instead entire limb

20:20 Brain Maps Body Plan

functioning hand, brain will represent body plan have, not

neocortex, essence customized map experience. Now, true
however, say blind 50, 45 right now, always
sighted. blind 50, probably less opportunity use formerly
visual cortex things like braille reading hearing brain changed,



21:00 Kennard Principle (Margaret Kennard)

just not brain baby. actually principle
biology, not many people know this, actually principle neurology called
Kennard principle, says, going brain injury, want
early life. course better not brain injury going
want early life. based tremendous number
experiments examining amount recovery rate recovery humans

better injuries early life. Now, reassuring young folks,

21:36 Maps Meaning

not reassuring older folks. aspects neuroplasticity
nothing impairments. mean earlier said walking around
map, representation world around us can see edges, can see
colors, except folks color blind course, also map
emotional experience. map whether not certain people trustworthy,
certain people aren't trustworthy. years ago course woman came
said, know, wasn't teaching course, course
said, "I just tell every time speak, really stresses out."
said, "Well heard want specific?" said,
"Yeah, tone voice reminds somebody really terrible experience
with." said, "Well, okay, well, can't change voice really appreciate
acknowledge also will help explain seem cringe every time
speak", hadn't noticed notice.
immediate kind visceral response speech, perhaps
right now. event, period two-week course,
come back every say, "You know think, just telling
voice really difficult listen to, actually becoming tolerable

23:00 Awareness Cues Brain Change



says recognition something whether not
emotional thing desire learn something else actually first step
neuroplasticity. nervous system two broad sets functions.
functions reflexive. Things like breathing, heart rate,
obvious ones, aspects reflexive like ability walk. get
chair walk door, don't think step taking
learned walk development. decide
going shift sort behavior reaction new piece information
want learn, something want bring consciousness,
awareness remarkable thing cues brain rest nervous
system engage reflexive actions going forward,
reflexive actions no longer fated reflexive. Now sounds little bit
abstract, going talk protocols this. first step
neuroplasticity recognizing want change something
immediately say, well, kids don't go school say, oh, want learn language
want learn social interactions, beauty childhood. whole brain
switch flipped making change possible deliberate.
know exactly want change. don't know exactly
want change, least know want change
something specific experience. case, believe came told
voice really awful listen not make feel bad
reason except wanted not case. knew wasn't going
stop talking. decided call consciousness mine well.
important. want learn something want change nervous system
way, whether not impairment something
want acquire, cognitive skill, motor skill, emotional skill, first thing
recognizing thing is. often can hardest thing identify
brain self recognition mechanisms self recognition mechanisms
not vague, spiritual mystical

25:20 Chemistry Change

even psychological concepts. neurochemicals. going talk next
neurochemicals stamp particular behaviors thoughts


emotional patterns tell rest nervous system, something pay
attention direction change want make.
repeat that, specific chemicals consciously aware
change want make even just want make change, chemicals
released brain allow us opportunity make changes. Now,
specific protocols science tells us follow want changes
occur. self-recognition not kind murky concept. fore
brain, particular prefrontal cortex, signaling rest nervous system

26:15 Giant Lie Universe

something do, hear, feel experience worth paying attention
to. pause going move forward. One biggest lies
universe seems quite prominent right now every experience
changes brain. People love say this. love say, brain going
different lecture brain going different today's class
two days ago. absolutely not true. nervous system doesn't just
change experienced something unless young child.
nervous system changes certain neurochemicals released allow whatever
neurons active period chemicals swimming around,
strengthen weaken connections neurons. Now, best illustrated
little bit scientific history. whole basis neuroplasticity

27:10 Fathers Neuroplasticity/Critical Periods

essentially ascribed two individuals, although lot people
involved work. two individuals go name David Hubel
Torsten Wiesel. David Hubel Torsten Wiesel started off Johns Hopkins, moved
Harvard medical school. seventies eighties, series
experiments, recording electrical activity brain. visual cortex,
meaning put electrodes visual cortex, exploring vision
works visual brain organizes features visual world give us
incredible things call visual perceptions. Hubel physician.
interested happens instance, child comes world


cataract, lens eye, isn't clear opaque. kid
lazy eye eyes called strabismus, eyes either
deviate outward inward. common things childhood, especially
particular areas world. David Torsten figured
critical period clear vision not occur, visual brain
completely rewire itself, basically represent whatever bit visual information
coming in. experiments kind simulate droopy eye deviating
eye close one eyelid found visual brain
respond entirely open eye. sort takeover visual brain
representing open eye. Many experiments many different sensory systems
followed this. beautiful experiments instance, Gregg
Recanzone's lab UC Davis Mike Merzenich's lab UCSF showing
instance two fingers taped together early development, weren't moving
independently, representation two fingers become fused brain
person couldn't actually distinguish movements sensations
two fingers separately, pretty remarkable. say David Torsten's
work, won noble prize, shared Rogers Barry, work
showed

29:30 Competition Route Plasticity

brain fact customized map outside world, said already.
measuring amount activity given part body, one
eye other, fingers, finger finger inputs
competing space brain. Now fundamentally important
means change nervous system adulthood, need think
not just trying get, trying give up. can't actually
add new connections without removing something else. might seem like kind
stinger actually turns great advantage. One key experiments
David Torsten experiment closed eyes,
essentially removed visual input early development. Now slightly different
blindness transient, short period time.
found no change. However, close just
one eye huge change. people tell you, oh end today's


lecture, end something brain going completely different,
simply not true. older 25 brain will not change unless
selective shift attention selective shift experience tells brain
time change. changes occur ways talked
strengthening weakening particular connections, names like long-term
potentiation, long-term depression, nothing emotional depression
way, spike-timing-dependent plasticity. threw names not confuse
you, like in-depth exploration those, please
can go google look up, great Wikipedia pages
can go paper trail. might even touch subsequent
episodes. important thing understand want something change,
really need bring immense amount attention whatever want
change. much linked statement made earlier about, starts
awareness. Now, attention important? Well, David Torsten won
Nobel prize certainly deserved it. probably deserved two
also figured vision works. might biased 'cause scientific
great-grandparents think everybody field Neuroscience agrees Hubel
Wiesel, called H&W game, absolutely deserved Nobel
prize work really unveiled mechanisms brain change
plasticity. David passed away years ago, Torsten still alive, late 90s,
still Rockefeller university. sharp tack. still jogs several miles
day. really art number things. also super nice guy. Hubel
really nice guy well, also great Frisbee player discovered 'cause
beat game ultimate like 80, still, little bit irked.
anyway, Hubel Wiesel amazing thing science will forever change

32:30 Correcting Errors History

way think brain. However, quite wrong critical
period thing. critical period idea deprive nervous
system input, say closing one eye early development rest visual
cortex taken representation open eye, never change
unless intervened early. actually formed basis kid
lazy eye cataract why, even though issues anesthesia


young children, now know want get early fix cataract
fix strabismus ophthalmologists do. However, idea
early else no opportunity rescue nervous system deficit later
turned wasn't entirely true. early 90s, graduate student

33:29 Adult Brain Change: Bumps Beeps

name Gregg Recanzone laboratory guy named Mike Merzenich
UCSF. set test idea one wants change brain,
need early life adult brain simply isn't plastic not available
changes. series absolutely beautiful experiments, now think
can say proving adult brain can change provided certain conditions met.
Now, experiments tough. tough experimenter
tough subject. just describe one. say subject one
experiments. come lab sit table
record image brain look representation fingers
digits call them. spinning drum, literally like stone drum
front metal drum little bumps. bumps spaced close
together, spaced far apart. experiments
expect subjects press lever whenever instance,
bumps got closer together apart subtle differences.
order really pay attention distance bumps
not braille readers anyone skilled kinds experiments.
found people paid attention distance

hard imagine translate real world non braille reader.
told us maps touch much available plasticity.
fully adult subjects. not taking specific drugs. don't
impairments aware of. showed, proved adult
brain plastic. beautiful control experiments important


everyone understand sometimes bring people
touch bumps spinning drum
person pay attention auditory cue. Every time tone go off,
shift pitch tone, signal that. subject thought
something related touch hearing showed wasn't
just mere action touching bumps. pay attention bumps
themselves. placing attention auditory cue tone, well
plasticity auditory portion brain not touch portion
brain. really spits face thing hear often every
experience

36:25 Takes Learn

going change way brain works. Absolutely not.
experiences pay super careful attention open plasticity
opens plasticity specific experience. question why?
Merzenich graduate students postdocs went address question
why. turns answer straightforward neurochemical answer.
inside answer opportunity us change brain point
throughout lifespan, essentially anything want learn,
subtracting emotion experience had, building greater
range emotion, learning new information like learning new language.
learning new motor skill, like dance sport combination
cognitive motor. instance, air traffic controller lot mind
addition lot hands. not just cognitive, not just motor
combined. going talk chemical just give
important hint, chemical chemical stress. not discussion
stress per se. future podcast episode, talk stress tools
deal stress, something lab works quite extensively. topic
enjoy discussing. topic brain change. just told
order change brain pay careful attention. immediate question
well, why? Well, answer pay careful attention
two neurochemicals, neuromodulators called, released multiple
sites brain



38:15 Adrenalin Alertness

highlight neural circuits stand chance changing. Now not necessarily
case going change, first gate open order
change occur. first neurochemical epinephrin, also adrenaline. call
adrenaline released adrenal glands kidneys,
body, call epinephrin brain, chemically identical substances.
Epinephrin released region brainstem called locus coeruleus. Fancy
name, don't need know unless want to. Locus coeruleus sends
little wires call axons hoses entire brain essentially
neurochemical, epinephrin. Now not always hosing brain epinephrin.
high states alertness epinephrin released. way
circuit designed, nonspecific. essentially waking entire brain
way epinephrin works binding particular receptors
increase likelihood neurons will active. no alertness, no neuroplasticity.
However, alertness alone not sufficient. say, necessary not
sufficient neuroplasticity. know true also work Hubel Wiesel
looked brain plasticity response certain experiences subjects
either awake asleep. hate break cannot just simply
listen things sleep learn materials. Later talk can
certain things sleep unaware can enhance learning things
aware awake. not just listening
music listening tape sleep expecting sink in,
speak. Epinephrin released pay attention alert.

40:18 Acetylcholine Spotlight

important thing getting plasticity there'll epinephrin
equates alertness, plus release neuromodulator, acetylcholine. Now
acetylcholine released two sites brain. One also brainstem
named different things different animals, humans rich site
acetylcholine neurons neurons make acetylcholine parabigeminal nucleus
parabrachial region. number different names aggregates


neurons. don't need know names, need know
area brainstem area sends wires, axons area
brain filters sensory input. area brain called thalamus
getting bombarded sorts sensory input time. Costello snoring off
right, lights room, presence computer left,
coming in. pay attention something like really hone Costello
snoring, create cone attention cone attention reflects
acetylcholine now amplifying signal sounds Costello making
snoring essentially making signal greater signal around it,
call signal-to-noise goes up. engineering background will
familiar signal-to-noise. not engineering background,
don't worry it. means one particular shout crowd comes through,
Costello's snoring becomes salient, apparent relative everything else
going on. Acetylcholine acts spotlight epinephrin alertness. acetylcholine
spotlighting inputs. two things alone not enough get plasticity.
needs third component. third component acetylcholine released
area forebrain called nucleus basalis. really want get technical,
called nucleus basalis Meynert. buddying physicians
going medical school, know that.

42:26 Chemical Trio Massive Brain Change

acetylcholine released brainstem, acetylcholine released
nucleus basalis epinephrin, can change brain. can say
confidence Merzenich Recanzone well members
Merzenich lab, Michael Kilgard others incredible experiments
stimulated release acetylcholine nucleus basalis either electrode
methods talk about. found
stimulate three brain regions, locus coeruleus, brainstem source
acetylcholine basal forebrain source acetylcholine.
three things whatever happen listening to, paying attention
immediately one trial takes representation particular area brain.
essentially get rapid massive learning one shop. shown
variety papers also guy named Norman Weinberger


UC Irvine. now considered fundamental principle nervous
system works. Hubel Wiesel talked critical periods developmental
plasticity, clear work Merzenich Weinberg others,
get three things, can access three things epinephrin, acetylcholine
two sources, not will nervous system change, change.
absolutely will change. important thing people understand
want change brain. cannot just passively experience things
repetition can important, way use repetition change brain
fundamentally different. now talk translate

44:10 Ways Change Brain

scientific information history protocols can actually apply,
think many interested in. willing bet
not interested lowering electrodes nucleus basalis frankly,
neither I. episode one Huberman Lab Podcast, described various ways
people can monitor change nervous system. ways include brain
machine interface, pharmacology, behavioral practices, behavioral practices
course can include dos, don'ts, don't that, et cetera
thinking neuroplasticity, want frank conversation one
can also acknowledge untapped capacity just not hearing
there, one can also combine behavioral practices pharmacology. One can
combine behavioral practices brain machine interface, don't
that. fact, not recommending anything particular. always, say
again, not physician, don't prescribe anything. professor, profess
lot things. health medical care you.
responsible health wellbeing. not going tell
take. going describe literature tells us suggests ways
access plasticity. know need epinephrin, means alertness. people

obvious one. get sleep handled. place,

46:16 Love, Hate, & Shame: chemical

question access alertness? Well, number ways.
people use pretty elaborate psychological gymnastics. will tell people
going something create accountability. really
good. post picture online commit learning

somebody love want devote somebody. truth
standpoint epinephrin getting alert activated, doesn't really matter.
Epinephrin chemical brain not distinguish things
love hate, anger fear. really doesn't, promote autonomic arousal
release epinephrin. think people feeling not motivated
make changes key thing identify not just one

47:30 Dopamine Trap

probably kit reasons, several reasons want make
particular change drawn toward particular goal excited can
one, also motivated not completely afraid, ashamed, humiliated not
following goal another. just want briefly mention one little aside
got friend physician, cardiologist really
interesting theory. just theory, think will resonate lot people,
that, heard molecule dopamine gives us sense reward
accomplish something. Well, also want able access dopamine
working towards things, enjoy process say, 'cause sorts


positive effects gives us energy, et cetera. friend, says is, know,
many many instances someone will come say, "You know
what, going write book." says, "Oh, great. sure book's going
terrific really write book." never go it.
theory is, get much dopamine reward people saying, Oh yeah,
absolutely going able that, might not actually go reward
accomplishment itself. aware positive reinforcements also. not
saying people flagellate point victory whatever
pursuing, motivation tricky one. suggest everyone asks
want accomplish? driving accomplish
come two three things. Fear-based perhaps, love-based perhaps
perhaps several order ensure alertness, energy attention task.
brings us attention part. Now one thing electrode
embedded brain increase amount acetylcholine. another exist
real world outside laboratory trouble focusing. trouble
bringing attention particular location space particular event.
lot discussion nowadays smartphones devices creating sort attention
deficit, almost clinical level many people, including adults. think largely
true. means, however, responsible

49:40 Nicotine Focus

learning create depth focus. important Neuroscience
principles get depth focus. want briefly talk pharmacology first
always get asked this. People say, "What can take increase
levels acetylcholine?" Well, things can take. Nicotine called nicotine
acetylcholine binds nicotinic receptor. two kinds
acetylcholine receptors, muscarinic nicotinic, nicotinic ones involved
attention alertness. colleagues, not my, know kind like bro,
science buddies, friends too, Nobel prize winning colleague
chews Nicorette works. used smoker. quit smoking
fear lung cancer, seemed like smart choice, missed level focus
bring work. somebody long career. ever
meet him, unfortunately can't name him. ever meet realize


chews five pieces Nicorette hour, not suggesting people do.
asked him, "Why this?" said, "Well, increases alertness
focus." also theory want really underscore theory not
scientifically supported yet, offsets Parkinson's Alzheimer's. true
nucleus basalis primary site degeneration brain, people
dementia Parkinson's leads lot inability focus
attention, not just deficits plasticity. might onto something. Now tried
chewing Nicorette, makes super jittery. don't like can't focus well.
kind takes far level autonomic arousal. got friends dip
Nicorette day, scientists, writers artists musicians
familiar effects nicotine era lot people smoked
fortunately fewer people smoke now. interested pharmacology,
supplements things can increase cholinergic transmission brain.
not suggesting going go route, want
careful much rely time. essence plasticity
create window attention focus distinct rest day.
going create mark brain potential plasticity. Things
increase acetylcholine, besides nicotine Nicorette, nicotine come
variety sources things like alpha-GPC choline. number
things. encourage go examine.com, website just put
acetylcholine will give list supplements well dangers
supplements associated cholinergic transmission.
remiss lying didn't say lot people

52:30 Sprinting

using cholinergic drugs order increase level focus. since
coming Olympics, don't want get anyone trouble well aware
fact sprinters really cholinergic drugs not
acetylcholine important focus allows hear gun first
blocks sprints. lot race won, hearing gun
quickest reaction time. take cholinergic agents well
acetylcholine molecule controls nerve muscle contraction. speed
reflexes actually controlled nicotinic transmission well. lots think


terms acetylcholine sport mental acuity, not just plasticity. Now
you, probably don't want chew Nicorette, definitely don't want smoke cigarettes
take supplements increasing acetylcholine. ways can
increase acetylcholine? there, going sound like bit circular argument
increase focus.

53:30 Focus

increase focus? know, people familiar sitting down, reading
couple pages book realizing none sunk talking someone
seeing mouth move, maybe even nodding head subconsciously none
sinks in. can damaging school, work performance relationships
many know. Costello incidentally never seems pay attention anything say
looking directly me, contradicts say,
best way get better focusing use mechanisms focus born
with. key principle mental focus follows visual focus.
familiar fact visual system can unfocused, blurry jumping around
can laser focused one location space. interesting vitally
important understanding access neuroplasticity can use visual
focus can increase visual focus way increasing mental focus
abilities broadly. going explain that. Plasticity starts
alertness. mentioned before, alertness can come sense love,
sense joy, sense fear, doesn't matter. pharmacologic ways access
alertness too. common one course caffeine watch sleep
episodes, know reduces molecule makes us sleepy called adenosine.
drink plenty caffeine. heavy user caffeine. don't think abuser caffeine.
think reasonable amounts provided can still fall asleep night, caffeine can
relatively safe way

55:22 Adderall: Use & Abuse

increase epinephrin. Now, many people now also using Adderall. Adderall
chemically looks lot like amphetamine basically amphetamine. will increase
epinephrin release locus coeruleus, will wake brain lot


people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes
prescribed attention deficit. However, also high probability abuse
especially not prescribed it. Adderall will not increase focus,
increases alertness. not touch acetylcholine system.
taking Adderall say, "Well, really increases focus overall", probably
autonomic nervous system just veering towards call
parasympathetic. really just sleepy bringing levels
alertness up. mentioned, Adderall problematic number people
can habit forming. Learning Adderall not always translate high-
performance off Adderall later times. Adderall discussion broader
one perhaps psychiatrist room point
widely abused drug point time.

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog
bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused
anything. Think grazing animals, cows, sheep birds, et cetera.
think bird picking seeds beach concrete. bird's head
here. foot off ground, small bird six inches off
ground eyes side head yet tiny beak can
quickly pick little seeds off ground immense precision. Now, try
staring off sides room picking items front
high precision tiny scale, little tiny objects, will miss almost every time.
perfectly don't smash beak ground damage it,
beautiful movement acuity also. it? create
focus awareness front them? turns lower head,
eyes, briefly move inward, called vergence eye movement. Now
eyes can't actually translocate head, fixed skull, just like
mine are. move eyes slightly inward, maybe can tell
like basically shortening making inter pupillary distance called smaller.
Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,
activate set neurons brainstem trigger release
norepinephrine, epinephrin acetylcholine. Norepinephrine kind similar
epinephrin. words, eyes relaxed head just
kind looking entire visual environment, moving head around, moving
space optic flow, things moving past us sitting still,
looking broadly space, relaxed. eyes move slightly inward toward
particular visual target visual world shrinks, level visual focus goes


know relates release acetylcholine epinephrin relevant
sites brain plasticity. Now, means hard time
focusing mind sake reading listening, need practice can
practice focusing visual system. Now works best practice focusing
visual system precise distance, work intend sake
plasticity. look real world? say, trying concentrate
something related to, don't know, science, reading science paper
hard time, not absorbing. might think looking paper
reading. looking screen, actually eyes probably darting
around bit. Experiments done this. gathering information
many sources visual environment. Now, presumably me, already
coffee, hydrated. well rested, slept well. still experienced
challenges focusing spending just 60 120 seconds focusing visual attention
small window screen, meaning just screen nothing it, bringing
eyes particular location increases not just visual acuity location
brings increase activity bunch brain areas associated
gathering information location. put simply, want improve
ability focus practice visual focus. Now, wear contacts wear corrective
lenses, fine. course want use those. don't want take
off use blurry image. finer visual image can hold

1:02:59 Blinking

gaze visual image, higher levels attention will be. Many times
Instagram teased not blinking often. actually
practiced thing. blink get tired, hear probably just
say, duh. get tired, neurons brainstem responsible alertness
hold eyelids open start falter eyelids start close.
hard, words, "I barely keep eyes open" may feel right
now. assuming paying attention alert, alert,
eyes wide, eyes open. get tired, eyelids start close.
Blinks, actually reset perception time space. shown beautiful
paper Current Biology. sure post reference notes. blinking
course necessary lubricate eyes. People blink eyes might get dry.


can keep focused blinking less focusing eyes particular
location probably pretty creepy experience this.
can can maintain kind cone tunnel
mental focus. sort revealing practice worked hard
blinking contest 14-year-old niece still beats every time
really bothers me, also just self practice learning blink less
focus visual attention smaller region space. Now me, important
mainly learning things computer screen. going
sport, quite bit different can discuss might translate sport.
fact, next episode, going talk plasticity focus
mechanisms relate learning movement practices coordinated movements.
entire discussion unto principle holds. need alertness.
can get mental tricks motivation, fear love, whatever is,
pharmacology, please healthfully. know, caffeine practice,
certainly want well hydrated increases actually will increase alertness. Well,
full bladder will increase alertness although don't want alertness
high can think fact go urinate 'cause
distracting. don't want alertness go roof. need
focus visual focus primary way start deploy
neurochemicals. Now may ask, well, experiment people
feeling rotating drum

1:05:30 Ear Toward Learning

listening auditory cue doesn't involve vision all? look people
learning things auditory system, will often close eyes.
not coincidence. somebody listening hard, please don't ask look
directly eye also asking listen you. actually one
worst ways get somebody listen you. say, now listen look
eye. visual system will take see mouth move,
going hear thoughts going hear saying. Closing
eyes one best ways create cone auditory attention.
low vision no vision folks do. tremendous capacity focus attention
particular locations.



1:06:14 Best Listeners World

Incidentally anyone know two animals best hearing world?
absolute best hearing many orders magnitude better humans. turns

blind, right? look away no reason look keys,
oftentimes orient ear one side head keys piano.
mentioned before, people non-sighted better pitch.
cones attention can devote. people, vision primary way
train focus building cones attention. absolutely focus

1:07:40 ADHD & ADD: Attention Deficit (Hyperactivity) Disorder

goal learn control visual window sake controlling
focus, can immensely powerful portal mechanisms plasticity,
know engages things like nucleus basalis brainstem
mechanisms. get lot questions attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD,
attention deficit disorder. people actually clinically diagnosed ADD
ADHD. do, certainly work good psychiatrist try figure
right pharmacology and/or behavioral practices you. Many people, however,


given low grade ADHD ADD way move
world. looking phone lot time. actually
easy anchor attention phone following reason. First all,
restricted size. easy limit visual attention something
big. one design features phone. other, just
probably heard picture worth thousand words, well, movie worth 10,000
pictures. Anytime looking things motion, visual motion, attentional
system will naturally gravitate towards them, towards movies. actually much
harder read words page used many people, used
seeing things spelled us YouTube videos videos things move
dramatic. true look motion stimulate,
seeing movies things things dramatic intense,
worst getting attending things like text page listening
something like podcast extracting information much think many
people asked me, "Hey know what, aren't providing intense visuals
us look at?" Well, frankly, lot people consuming content
pure auditory, through, listening. want able digest
material. addition that, think areas life dictate
whether not become successful, independent, healthy individuals,
involve kind boring practices digesting information page. Boring
not exciting moment perhaps watching movie something
spoonfed us. attention can put something, even fleeting
feel like getting little bits pieces, shards information
opposed entire thing, much powerful effect engaging
cholinergic system plasticity does, instance, watching movie.
watch movie, entire thing can great, can awesome.
can overriding experience think experiences,
somebody interested building brain expanding brain getting
better various things, feeling better, better, et cetera, one ask
much neurochemical resources devoting passive experience letting
something, just kind overwhelm excite me, versus something really
trying learn take away. now another enjoy movie content TV

don't want tell people not think carefully often
focusing something good poor focusing
something challenging.

1:12:00 Ultra(dian) Focus

get epinephrin, alertness, get acetylcholine released
can focus attention. question long? earlier
podcast, talked ultradian cycles lasts 90 minutes. typical
learning 90 minutes. think learning will no doubt
include five 10 minutes warmup period. think everyone give
permission not fully focused early part about. middle
middle hour able maintain focus
hour so. means eliminating distractions. means turning off wifi.
put phone room. find reflexively getting get phone
will take phone lock car outside. find going get anyway,
guilty giving away phone period time even things dramatic,

want try literally maintain visual focus thing trying learn.

1:13:30 Real Change Occurs



Feel free blink, course, can greatly increase powers focus
rates learning anchored work Merzenich, Hubel Wiesel
others. Now trigger plasticity, real secret neuroplasticity
doesn't occur wakefulness. occurs sleep. now know focus
hard something 90 minutes so, maybe even several bouts
per day. can that, people can, people can one focus
learning, night following nights, asleep neural
circuits highlighted will acetylcholine transmission will strengthen
will lost, wonderful essence plasticity.
means eventually wake couple days week later,
will will acquired knowledge forever unless go process
actively unlearn it. will talk unlearning later episode. mastering
sleep key order reinforce learning occurs. say get really
poor night sleep learning. Chances are, sleep next night
following night learning will occur. stamp brain
acetylcholine released. actually marks synapses neurochemically
metabolically, synopses biased change. Now, don't
ever get deep sleep probably won't get changes. also way
can bypass need deep sleep least partially engaging
call Non Sleep Deep Rest, NSDR protocols. just want discuss signs
this. paper published Cell Reports last year shows
people did, spatial memory task, actually quite difficult one
remember sequence lights lighting just two three lights
particular sequence easy get 15 16 lights numbers
sequence actually gets quite challenging. immediately after, immediately
learning actual performance task, people took 20 minute Non Sleep
Deep Rest protocol took shallow nap, lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,
just closing eyes, no sensory input, rates learning significantly higher
information two just good night's sleep following night.
can actually accelerate learning NSDR protocols brief naps, 90
minutes less. key plasticity childhood child.

1:16:20 Much Learning Enough?



key plasticity adulthood engage alertness, engage focus
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest deep sleep typical sleep.
always get asked, "How many bouts learning can perform?" Well, know people
train visual focus mechanisms point can several 90
minute bouts throughout day, many three four. also
inserting Non Sleep Deep Rest well. Now can get pretty tricky.

1:16:50 Learning (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift

lot people find can recover best intense bouts focused
learning motor activity get self-generated optic flow.
make sense ever heard lecture stress done
little bit various podcasts. mode self-generated optic flow like
walking running cycling things just floating past us retina, not
really looking anywhere particular, opposite tight window focus.
that, areas brain like amygdala involved
releasing epinephrin create alertness. extremes, creates fear certainly
alertness, shut down. form non sleep deep rest.
people find much pleasurable practical engage focused
learning go activity involves essentially call
worldlessness not really thinking much anything.
listen audio books podcasts run may want consider
whether not want spend time right now. love
listening podcast run cycle, much interested
actually getting benefits neuroplasticity just listening sake
listening me. many people letting mind drift not organized

things,

1:18:16 Synthesis/Summary

including Cell Reports paper mentioned moments ago. want
synthesize information covered now. entire month


neuroplasticity. Today's episode covered lot, no means
covered potential neuroplasticity protocols plasticity. will get
it. today want make sure key elements form backbone
neuroplasticity really embedded people's minds. First all, plasticity occurs
throughout lifespan. Early, birth 25, mere exposure sensory event can
create plasticity. good thing bad thing. going talk
unlearning bad stuff, traumas, et cetera subsequent episode month.
want learn adult, alert. might seem obvious think lot
people don't think 24 hour cycle, alert. four
episodes devoted 24-hour cycle cycles alertness sleep.
encourage listen haven't opportunity yet just ask
day typically tend alert? will afford
advantage learning specific things period time. don't give
period time things meaningless, useless, not aligned goals.
That'd terrible time get passive observance just letting time get
soaked away something. valuable asset, epinephrin, released
brainstem going occur readily particular phases 24-hour cycle
others, waking phase course. know are.
start think behavioral practices, maybe pharmacologic
practices like caffeine, hydration, et cetera will support heightened levels
alertness. Attention something can learned attention critical creating
condition whatever engaging will modify brain
way won't spend much attention going forward.
essence plasticity, things will eventually become reflexive. language
learning, motor movement, cognitive skill, ability suppress
emotional response engage emotional response depending goals
appropriate you. Increasing acetylcholine can accomplished
pharmacologically nicotine. However, certain dangers many people
well cost, financial cost, learning engage cholinergic
system use visual system, practicing long can maintain focus
blinks need them, long can maintain visual focus target,
just piece paper set feet away room level computer
screen. actually things people communities high levels
visual focus necessary. Now, way get high levels visual focus


alertness panic situation very, bad. will
immediately focused everything related situation, unfortunate.
really talking trying harness mechanisms attention get
better paying attention. may want auditory system, not
visual system, either low vision no vision,
trying learn something relates sounds see.
people trying learn information, cognitive information, trying learn
hear nuance partner's explanations emotionally challenging
events, et cetera. just remember, way, said earlier,
really want somebody listen really hear saying
underlying it, not, cannot expect look directly
that. actually going limit ability focus. trying rescue folks
might struggle. course never struggle.
supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus
entire period one 90-minute cycle. beginning end going little bit
flickering focus. know one 90-minute cycles
starting, typically wake os beginning first 90-minute cycle,


not minute. able tap sense 90-minute
cycles start engage learning practices choose.
course getting non sleep deep rest just deliberate disengagement,
walking running, just sitting, eyes closed eyes open kind mindlessly
might seem chair, just letting thoughts move around learning will
accelerate rate plasticity shown quality peer reviewed studies.
course, deep sleep. can start see plasticity
natural right early life. age 25 work order
access it. fortunately, beautiful experiments Hubel Wiesel
Merzenich Weinberger others point direction allows us achieve
plasticity,

1:25:15 Learning Repetition, Forming Habits

points neurochemicals circuits. now behavioral protocols
allow us that. also really want emphasize entire
aspect behavioral practices will allow us engage plasticity don't involve
intense focus emotionality involve lot repetition. another entire
category plasticity involves seemed like almost mundane things
repeatedly incorporating reward system
involves dopamine. today talked kind plasticity comes
extreme focus. get extreme focus alertness naturally
harder, difficult event didn't want. kind stinger brain
designed keep safe wants get one trial learning things like touching
hot stove engaging really horrible person. can get incredible plasticity
positive experiences things want engaging high focus regime
rest, non sleep deep rest, sleep. another aspect plasticity
will explore next episode well explore movement-based practices
enhancing plasticity plasticity movement itself. not high
attention kind high emotionality intensity experiences described
today. repetition reward repeat, repetition, reward,
repeat, used distinctly different category behavioral change
relate habits opposed learning particular types information allow
us perform physically, cognitively adjust emotional system. going stop

13:10 New Neuron Myth

stories popular press addition new neurons. idea, oh,
go running exercise, brain actually makes new neurons. Well, going
give bad news first that, puberty, age 14 15,
human brain nervous system adds new neurons. idea
new neurons added brain one rich history experimental
science. clear rodents non-human primates new neurons,
process called neurogenesis, can occur areas brain, olfactory bulb,
course involved smell well region hippocampus, center
brain involved memory called dentate gyrus hippocampus.
strong evidence new neurons can added structures throughout
lifespan. humans, evidence little bit controversial.



14:10 Anosmia: Losing Smell

clear can add new neurons olfactory bulb. fact,
ever unfortunate experience hit head hard, wires called
axons olfactory neurons live nose can get sheared off
pass bony plate called cribriform plate. cribriform
plate can shear axons people can become called anosmic, won't
able smell. time, neurons unlike central nervous system
neurons can grow connections back even reestablish new neurons
added olfactory bulb. come elsewhere deep brain
migrate pathway called rostral migratory stream. can Google
words look descriptions like learn more. indeed
evidence neurons responsible smell can replaced
throughout lifespan. Certainly, young individuals birth till age 15
so. Whether not new neurons added hippocampus,

15:13 Neuronal Birthdays Near Death Day

memory center human brain isn't clear. Many years ago, Rusty Gage's lab
Salk Institute really important study looking terminally ill cancer patients
injecting label, dye incorporated new neurons.
patients died, brains harvested. brains looked
new neurons there, evidence new neurons. results think
stand time not really discussed popular press discussion
around papers cells added.
number papers come along years mainly labs UCSF, although
others well, showing new neurons added adult brain,
infinitesimally small number new neurons. depressing part, don't
get new neurons. born, pretty much neurons going
use entire life. yes, get older start lose certain functions
brain, lose neurons. not lost, speak, ways
neurocircuits can create new connections add new functions including new
memory, new abilities new cognitive functions. mainly


process making certain connections, course things call
synapses, neurons making connections stronger.
reliable, likely engage

16:45 Circumstances Brain Change

well removing connections. removal connections vital say moving
grieving process removing emotional load traumatic experience.
even though can't add new neurons throughout lifespan, least not great
numbers, clear can change nervous system, nervous system
available change, create right set circumstances brain,
chemical circumstances, create right environmental circumstances around
us, nervous system will shift mode

17:21 Brain Space

change isn't just possible probable. mentioned before, hallmark
child nervous system change, wants change. whole thing, everything
chemicals sloshing around fact lot space
neurons. lot people don't know this, early development lot
space neurons. neurons can literally move around sample
different connections easily removing keeping others. get older,
so-called extracellular space actually filled things called extracellular matrix
glial cells. Glial means glue. cells involved bunch different
processes start fill space kind like pouring concrete
rocks. happens, becomes much harder change connections
there. One ways can get plasticity stage throughout
lifespan deficits impairments call sensory apparati,
eyes, ears, nose, mouth, dramatic somewhat
tragic examples people, instance genetic mutations born
without nose

18:30 No Nose, Eyes, Ears



without olfactory structures brain cannot smell. case areas
brain normally represent smell become overtaken areas brain
involved things like touch hearing sight. individuals blind
birth, so-called occipital cortex, visual cortex back, becomes
overtaken hearing. neurons will start respond sounds well braille
touch. actually one particularly tragic incident woman
blind since birth neuroimaging studies, knew visual cortex
no longer visual, responsible braille reading hearing, stroke
actually took function visual cortex. blind,
couldn't braille read hear. recover aspect function. Now,
people don't end highly unfortunate situation. know
instance,

19:30 Enhanced Hearing Touch Blind

blind people use visual cortex braille reading hearing, much
better auditory acuity touch acuity. Meaning can sense things fingers
can sense things hearing typical sighted folks wouldn't able to.
fact, will find much greater incidence perfect pitch people blind.
tells us brain particular area call neocortex,
outer part, really designed map individual experience. these,
call experiments impairment loss somebody blind birth deaf
birth maybe limb development impairment stump
instead entire limb

20:20 Brain Maps Body Plan

functioning hand, brain will represent body plan have, not

however, say blind 50, 45 right now, always
sighted. blind 50, probably less opportunity use formerly
visual cortex things like braille reading hearing brain changed,



21:00 Kennard Principle (Margaret Kennard)

just not brain baby. actually principle
biology, not many people know this, actually principle neurology called
Kennard principle, says, going brain injury, want
early life. course better not brain injury going
want early life. based tremendous number
experiments examining amount recovery rate recovery humans

better injuries early life. Now, reassuring young folks,

21:36 Maps Meaning

not reassuring older folks. aspects neuroplasticity
nothing impairments. mean earlier said walking around
map, representation world around us can see edges, can see
colors, except folks color blind course, also map
emotional experience. map whether not certain people trustworthy,
certain people aren't trustworthy. years ago course woman came
said, know, wasn't teaching course, course
said, "I just tell every time speak, really stresses out."
said, "Well heard want specific?" said,
"Yeah, tone voice reminds somebody really terrible experience

acknowledge also will help explain seem cringe every time
speak", hadn't noticed notice.
immediate kind visceral response speech, perhaps
right now. event, period two-week course,
come back every say, "You know think, just telling

23:00 Awareness Cues Brain Change



says recognition something whether not
emotional thing desire learn something else actually first step
neuroplasticity. nervous system two broad sets functions.
functions reflexive. Things like breathing, heart rate,
obvious ones, aspects reflexive like ability walk. get
chair walk door, don't think step taking
learned walk development. decide
going shift sort behavior reaction new piece information
want learn, something want bring consciousness,
awareness remarkable thing cues brain rest nervous
system engage reflexive actions going forward,
reflexive actions no longer fated reflexive. Now sounds little bit
abstract, going talk protocols this. first step
neuroplasticity recognizing want change something
immediately say, well, kids don't go school say, oh, want learn language
want learn social interactions, beauty childhood. whole brain
switch flipped making change possible deliberate.
know exactly want change. don't know exactly
want change, least know want change
something specific experience. case, believe came told
voice really awful listen not make feel bad
reason except wanted not case. knew wasn't going
stop talking. decided call consciousness mine well.
important. want learn something want change nervous system
way, whether not impairment something
want acquire, cognitive skill, motor skill, emotional skill, first thing
recognizing thing is. often can hardest thing identify
brain self recognition mechanisms self recognition mechanisms
not vague, spiritual mystical

25:20 Chemistry Change

even psychological concepts. neurochemicals. going talk next
neurochemicals stamp particular behaviors thoughts


emotional patterns tell rest nervous system, something pay
attention direction change want make.
repeat that, specific chemicals consciously aware
change want make even just want make change, chemicals
released brain allow us opportunity make changes. Now,
specific protocols science tells us follow want changes
occur. self-recognition not kind murky concept. fore
brain, particular prefrontal cortex, signaling rest nervous system

26:15 Giant Lie Universe

something do, hear, feel experience worth paying attention
to. pause going move forward. One biggest lies
universe seems quite prominent right now every experience
changes brain. People love say this. love say, brain going
different lecture brain going different today's class
two days ago. absolutely not true. nervous system doesn't just
change experienced something unless young child.
nervous system changes certain neurochemicals released allow whatever
neurons active period chemicals swimming around,
strengthen weaken connections neurons. Now, best illustrated
little bit scientific history. whole basis neuroplasticity

27:10 Fathers Neuroplasticity/Critical Periods

essentially ascribed two individuals, although lot people
involved work. two individuals go name David Hubel
Torsten Wiesel. David Hubel Torsten Wiesel started off Johns Hopkins, moved
Harvard medical school. seventies eighties, series
experiments, recording electrical activity brain. visual cortex,
meaning put electrodes visual cortex, exploring vision
works visual brain organizes features visual world give us
incredible things call visual perceptions. Hubel physician.
interested happens instance, child comes world


cataract, lens eye, isn't clear opaque. kid
lazy eye eyes called strabismus, eyes either
deviate outward inward. common things childhood, especially
particular areas world. David Torsten figured
critical period clear vision not occur, visual brain
completely rewire itself, basically represent whatever bit visual information
coming in. experiments kind simulate droopy eye deviating
eye close one eyelid found visual brain
respond entirely open eye. sort takeover visual brain
representing open eye. Many experiments many different sensory systems
followed this. beautiful experiments instance, Gregg
Recanzone's lab UC Davis Mike Merzenich's lab UCSF showing
instance two fingers taped together early development, weren't moving
independently, representation two fingers become fused brain
person couldn't actually distinguish movements sensations
two fingers separately, pretty remarkable. say David Torsten's
work, won noble prize, shared Rogers Barry, work
showed

29:30 Competition Route Plasticity

brain fact customized map outside world, said already.
measuring amount activity given part body, one
eye other, fingers, finger finger inputs
competing space brain. Now fundamentally important
means change nervous system adulthood, need think
not just trying get, trying give up. can't actually
add new connections without removing something else. might seem like kind
stinger actually turns great advantage. One key experiments
David Torsten experiment closed eyes,
essentially removed visual input early development. Now slightly different
blindness transient, short period time.
found no change. However, close just
one eye huge change. people tell you, oh end today's


lecture, end something brain going completely different,
simply not true. older 25 brain will not change unless
selective shift attention selective shift experience tells brain
time change. changes occur ways talked
strengthening weakening particular connections, names like long-term
potentiation, long-term depression, nothing emotional depression
way, spike-timing-dependent plasticity. threw names not confuse
you, like in-depth exploration those, please
can go google look up, great Wikipedia pages
can go paper trail. might even touch subsequent
episodes. important thing understand want something change,
really need bring immense amount attention whatever want
change. much linked statement made earlier about, starts
awareness. Now, attention important? Well, David Torsten won
Nobel prize certainly deserved it. probably deserved two
also figured vision works. might biased 'cause scientific
great-grandparents think everybody field Neuroscience agrees Hubel
Wiesel, called H&W game, absolutely deserved Nobel
prize work really unveiled mechanisms brain change
plasticity. David passed away years ago, Torsten still alive, late 90s,
still Rockefeller university. sharp tack. still jogs several miles
day. really art number things. also super nice guy. Hubel
really nice guy well, also great Frisbee player discovered 'cause
beat game ultimate like 80, still, little bit irked.
anyway, Hubel Wiesel amazing thing science will forever change

32:30 Correcting Errors History

way think brain. However, quite wrong critical
period thing. critical period idea deprive nervous
system input, say closing one eye early development rest visual
cortex taken representation open eye, never change
unless intervened early. actually formed basis kid
lazy eye cataract why, even though issues anesthesia


young children, now know want get early fix cataract
fix strabismus ophthalmologists do. However, idea
early else no opportunity rescue nervous system deficit later
turned wasn't entirely true. early 90s, graduate student

33:29 Adult Brain Change: Bumps Beeps

name Gregg Recanzone laboratory guy named Mike Merzenich
UCSF. set test idea one wants change brain,
need early life adult brain simply isn't plastic not available
changes. series absolutely beautiful experiments, now think
can say proving adult brain can change provided certain conditions met.
Now, experiments tough. tough experimenter
tough subject. just describe one. say subject one
experiments. come lab sit table
record image brain look representation fingers
digits call them. spinning drum, literally like stone drum
front metal drum little bumps. bumps spaced close
together, spaced far apart. experiments
expect subjects press lever whenever instance,
bumps got closer together apart subtle differences.
order really pay attention distance bumps
not braille readers anyone skilled kinds experiments.
found people paid attention distance
bumps signal change pressing
lever, rapid changes plasticity representation
fingers. go either direction. get people good detecting
distance bumps, distance getting smaller distance
getting greater. people get good tasks kind
hard imagine translate real world non braille reader.
told us maps touch much available plasticity.
fully adult subjects. not taking specific drugs. don't
impairments aware of. showed, proved adult
brain plastic. beautiful control experiments important


everyone understand sometimes bring people
touch bumps spinning drum
person pay attention auditory cue. Every time tone go off,
shift pitch tone, signal that. subject thought
something related touch hearing showed wasn't
just mere action touching bumps. pay attention bumps
themselves. placing attention auditory cue tone, well
plasticity auditory portion brain not touch portion
brain. really spits face thing hear often every
experience

36:25 Takes Learn

going change way brain works. Absolutely not.
experiences pay super careful attention open plasticity
opens plasticity specific experience. question why?
Merzenich graduate students postdocs went address question
why. turns answer straightforward neurochemical answer.
inside answer opportunity us change brain point
throughout lifespan, essentially anything want learn,
subtracting emotion experience had, building greater
range emotion, learning new information like learning new language.
learning new motor skill, like dance sport combination
cognitive motor. instance, air traffic controller lot mind
addition lot hands. not just cognitive, not just motor
combined. going talk chemical just give
important hint, chemical chemical stress. not discussion
stress per se. future podcast episode, talk stress tools
deal stress, something lab works quite extensively. topic
enjoy discussing. topic brain change. just told
order change brain pay careful attention. immediate question
well, why? Well, answer pay careful attention
two neurochemicals, neuromodulators called, released multiple
sites brain



38:15 Adrenalin Alertness

highlight neural circuits stand chance changing. Now not necessarily
case going change, first gate open order
change occur. first neurochemical epinephrin, also adrenaline. call
adrenaline released adrenal glands kidneys,
body, call epinephrin brain, chemically identical substances.
Epinephrin released region brainstem called locus coeruleus. Fancy
name, don't need know unless want to. Locus coeruleus sends
little wires call axons hoses entire brain essentially
neurochemical, epinephrin. Now not always hosing brain epinephrin.
high states alertness epinephrin released. way
circuit designed, nonspecific. essentially waking entire brain
way epinephrin works binding particular receptors
increase likelihood neurons will active. no alertness, no neuroplasticity.
However, alertness alone not sufficient. say, necessary not
sufficient neuroplasticity. know true also work Hubel Wiesel

important thing getting plasticity there'll epinephrin
equates alertness, plus release neuromodulator, acetylcholine. Now
acetylcholine released two sites brain. One also brainstem

53:30 Focus

increase focus? know, people familiar sitting down, reading

seeing mouth move, maybe even nodding head subconsciously none
sinks in. can damaging school, work performance relationships
many know. Costello incidentally never seems pay attention anything say
looking directly me, contradicts say,
best way get better focusing use mechanisms focus born

familiar fact visual system can unfocused, blurry jumping around
can laser focused one location space. interesting vitally
important understanding access neuroplasticity can use visual
focus can increase visual focus way increasing mental focus
abilities broadly. going explain that. Plasticity starts
alertness. mentioned before, alertness can come sense love,
sense joy, sense fear, doesn't matter. pharmacologic ways access
alertness too. common one course caffeine watch sleep

drink plenty caffeine. heavy user caffeine. don't think abuser caffeine.
think reasonable amounts provided can still fall asleep night, caffeine can

55:22 Adderall: Use & Abuse

increase epinephrin. Now, many people now also using Adderall. Adderall
chemically looks lot like amphetamine basically amphetamine. will increase
epinephrin release locus coeruleus, will wake brain lot


people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes
prescribed attention deficit. However, also high probability abuse
especially not prescribed it. Adderall will not increase focus,
increases alertness. not touch acetylcholine system.
taking Adderall say, "Well, really increases focus overall", probably
autonomic nervous system just veering towards call
parasympathetic. really just sleepy bringing levels
alertness up. mentioned, Adderall problematic number people
can habit forming. Learning Adderall not always translate high-
performance off Adderall later times. Adderall discussion broader
one perhaps psychiatrist room point
widely abused drug point time.

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog
bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused
anything. Think grazing animals, cows, sheep birds, et cetera.
think bird picking seeds beach concrete. bird's head
here. foot off ground, small bird six inches off
ground eyes side head yet tiny beak can
quickly pick little seeds off ground immense precision. Now, try
staring off sides room picking items front
high precision tiny scale, little tiny objects, will miss almost every time.
perfectly don't smash beak ground damage it,
beautiful movement acuity also. it? create
focus awareness front them? turns lower head,
eyes, briefly move inward, called vergence eye movement. Now
eyes can't actually translocate head, fixed skull, just like
mine are. move eyes slightly inward, maybe can tell
like basically shortening making inter pupillary distance called smaller.
Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,
activate set neurons brainstem trigger release
norepinephrine, epinephrin acetylcholine. Norepinephrine kind similar
epinephrin. words, eyes relaxed head just
kind looking entire visual environment, moving head around, moving
space optic flow, things moving past us sitting still,
looking broadly space, relaxed. eyes move slightly inward toward
particular visual target visual world shrinks, level visual focus goes


know relates release acetylcholine epinephrin relevant
sites brain plasticity. Now, means hard time
focusing mind sake reading listening, need practice can
practice focusing visual system. Now works best practice focusing
visual system precise distance, work intend sake

challenges focusing spending just 60 120 seconds focusing visual attention
small window screen, meaning just screen nothing it, bringing
eyes particular location increases not just visual acuity location
brings increase activity bunch brain areas associated
gathering information location. put simply, want improve

Instagram teased not blinking often. actually
practiced thing. blink get tired, hear probably just
say, duh. get tired, neurons brainstem responsible alertness
hold eyelids open start falter eyelids start close.
hard, words, "I barely keep eyes open" may feel right
now. assuming paying attention alert, alert,

1:05:30 Ear Toward Learning

listening auditory cue doesn't involve vision all? look people
learning things auditory system, will often close eyes.
not coincidence. somebody listening hard, please don't ask look
directly eye also asking listen you. actually one
worst ways get somebody listen you. say, now listen look

seeing things spelled us YouTube videos videos things move
dramatic. true look motion stimulate,
seeing movies things things dramatic intense,
worst getting attending things like text page listening
something like podcast extracting information much think many
people asked me, "Hey know what, aren't providing intense visuals
us look at?" Well, frankly, lot people consuming content
pure auditory, through, listening. want able digest

not exciting moment perhaps watching movie something
spoonfed us. attention can put something, even fleeting

watch movie, entire thing can great, can awesome.
can overriding experience think experiences,
somebody interested building brain expanding brain getting

1:12:00 Ultra(dian) Focus

get epinephrin, alertness, get acetylcholine released
can focus attention. question long? earlier
podcast, talked ultradian cycles lasts 90 minutes. typical
learning 90 minutes. think learning will no doubt
include five 10 minutes warmup period. think everyone give
permission not fully focused early part about. middle
middle hour able maintain focus
hour so. means eliminating distractions. means turning off wifi.

1:13:30 Real Change Occurs



Feel free blink, course, can greatly increase powers focus
rates learning anchored work Merzenich, Hubel Wiesel
others. Now trigger plasticity, real secret neuroplasticity
doesn't occur wakefulness. occurs sleep. now know focus
hard something 90 minutes so, maybe even several bouts
per day. can that, people can, people can one focus
learning, night following nights, asleep neural
circuits highlighted will acetylcholine transmission will strengthen
will lost, wonderful essence plasticity.
means eventually wake couple days week later,
will will acquired knowledge forever unless go process
actively unlearn it. will talk unlearning later episode. mastering
sleep key order reinforce learning occurs. say get really
poor night sleep learning. Chances are, sleep next night
following night learning will occur. stamp brain
acetylcholine released. actually marks synapses neurochemically
metabolically, synopses biased change. Now, don't
ever get deep sleep probably won't get changes. also way
can bypass need deep sleep least partially engaging
call Non Sleep Deep Rest, NSDR protocols. just want discuss signs
this. paper published Cell Reports last year shows
people did, spatial memory task, actually quite difficult one
remember sequence lights lighting just two three lights
particular sequence easy get 15 16 lights numbers
sequence actually gets quite challenging. immediately after, immediately
learning actual performance task, people took 20 minute Non Sleep
Deep Rest protocol took shallow nap, lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,
just closing eyes, no sensory input, rates learning significantly higher
information two just good night's sleep following night.
can actually accelerate learning NSDR protocols brief naps, 90
minutes less. key plasticity childhood child.

1:16:20 Much Learning Enough?



key plasticity adulthood engage alertness, engage focus
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest deep sleep typical sleep.
always get asked, "How many bouts learning can perform?" Well, know people
train visual focus mechanisms point can several 90
minute bouts throughout day, many three four. also
inserting Non Sleep Deep Rest well. Now can get pretty tricky.

1:16:50 Learning (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift

lot people find can recover best intense bouts focused
learning motor activity get self-generated optic flow.
make sense ever heard lecture stress done
little bit various podcasts. mode self-generated optic flow like
walking running cycling things just floating past us retina, not
really looking anywhere particular, opposite tight window focus.
that, areas brain like amygdala involved
releasing epinephrin create alertness. extremes, creates fear certainly

1:18:16 Synthesis/Summary

including Cell Reports paper mentioned moments ago. want
synthesize information covered now. entire month


neuroplasticity. Today's episode covered lot, no means
covered potential neuroplasticity protocols plasticity. will get
it. today want make sure key elements form backbone
neuroplasticity really embedded people's minds. First all, plasticity occurs
throughout lifespan. Early, birth 25, mere exposure sensory event can
create plasticity. good thing bad thing. going talk
unlearning bad stuff, traumas, et cetera subsequent episode month.
want learn adult, alert. might seem obvious think lot
people don't think 24 hour cycle, alert. four
episodes devoted 24-hour cycle cycles alertness sleep.
encourage listen haven't opportunity yet just ask
day typically tend alert? will afford
advantage learning specific things period time. don't give
period time things meaningless, useless, not aligned goals.
That'd terrible time get passive observance just letting time get
soaked away something. valuable asset, epinephrin, released
brainstem going occur readily particular phases 24-hour cycle
others, waking phase course. know are.
start think behavioral practices, maybe pharmacologic
practices like caffeine, hydration, et cetera will support heightened levels
alertness. Attention something can learned attention critical creating
condition whatever engaging will modify brain
way won't spend much attention going forward.
essence plasticity, things will eventually become reflexive. language
learning, motor movement, cognitive skill, ability suppress
emotional response engage emotional response depending goals
appropriate you. Increasing acetylcholine can accomplished
pharmacologically nicotine. However, certain dangers many people
well cost, financial cost, learning engage cholinergic
system use visual system, practicing long can maintain focus
blinks need them, long can maintain visual focus target,
just piece paper set feet away room level computer
screen. actually things people communities high levels
visual focus necessary. Now, way get high levels visual focus


alertness panic situation very, bad. will
immediately focused everything related situation, unfortunate.
really talking trying harness mechanisms attention get
better paying attention. may want auditory system, not
visual system, either low vision no vision,
trying learn something relates sounds see.
people trying learn information, cognitive information, trying learn
hear nuance partner's explanations emotionally challenging
events, et cetera. just remember, way, said earlier,
really want somebody listen really hear saying
underlying it, not, cannot expect look directly
that. actually going limit ability focus. trying rescue folks
might struggle. course never struggle.
supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus
entire period one 90-minute cycle. beginning end going little bit
flickering focus. know one 90-minute cycles
starting, typically wake os beginning first 90-minute cycle,


not minute. able tap sense 90-minute
cycles start engage learning practices choose.
course getting non sleep deep rest just deliberate disengagement,
walking running, just sitting, eyes closed eyes open kind mindlessly
might seem chair, just letting thoughts move around learning will
accelerate rate plasticity shown quality peer reviewed studies.
course, deep sleep. can start see plasticity
natural right early life. age 25 work order
access it. fortunately, beautiful experiments Hubel Wiesel
Merzenich Weinberger others point direction allows us achieve
plasticity,

1:25:15 Learning Repetition, Forming Habits

points neurochemicals circuits. now behavioral protocols
allow us that. also really want emphasize entire
aspect behavioral practices will allow us engage plasticity don't involve
intense focus emotionality involve lot repetition. another entire
category plasticity involves seemed like almost mundane things
repeatedly incorporating reward system
involves dopamine. today talked kind plasticity comes
extreme focus. get extreme focus alertness naturally
harder, difficult event didn't want. kind stinger brain

hot stove engaging really horrible person. can get incredible plasticity
positive experiences things want engaging high focus regime
rest, non sleep deep rest, sleep. another aspect plasticity
will explore next episode well explore movement-based practices
enhancing plasticity plasticity movement itself. not high
attention kind high emotionality intensity experiences described
today. repetition reward repeat, repetition, reward,
repeat, used distinctly different category behavioral change

little bit scientific history. whole basis neuroplasticity

27:10 Fathers Neuroplasticity/Critical Periods

essentially ascribed two individuals, although lot people
involved work. two individuals go name David Hubel
Torsten Wiesel. David Hubel Torsten Wiesel started off Johns Hopkins, moved
Harvard medical school. seventies eighties, series
experiments, recording electrical activity brain. visual cortex,
meaning put electrodes visual cortex, exploring vision
works visual brain organizes features visual world give us
incredible things call visual perceptions. Hubel physician.
interested happens instance, child comes world


cataract, lens eye, isn't clear opaque. kid
lazy eye eyes called strabismus, eyes either
deviate outward inward. common things childhood, especially
particular areas world. David Torsten figured
critical period clear vision not occur, visual brain
completely rewire itself, basically represent whatever bit visual information
coming in. experiments kind simulate droopy eye deviating
eye close one eyelid found visual brain
respond entirely open eye. sort takeover visual brain
representing open eye. Many experiments many different sensory systems
followed this. beautiful experiments instance, Gregg
Recanzone's lab UC Davis Mike Merzenich's lab UCSF showing
instance two fingers taped together early development, weren't moving
independently, representation two fingers become fused brain
person couldn't actually distinguish movements sensations
two fingers separately, pretty remarkable. say David Torsten's

David Torsten experiment closed eyes,
essentially removed visual input early development. Now slightly different

you, like in-depth exploration those, please
can go google look up, great Wikipedia pages
can go paper trail. might even touch subsequent
episodes. important thing understand want something change,
really need bring immense amount attention whatever want
change. much linked statement made earlier about, starts
awareness. Now, attention important? Well, David Torsten won
Nobel prize certainly deserved it. probably deserved two
also figured vision works. might biased 'cause scientific
great-grandparents think everybody field Neuroscience agrees Hubel
Wiesel, called H&W game, absolutely deserved Nobel
prize work really unveiled mechanisms brain change
plasticity. David passed away years ago, Torsten still alive, late 90s,
still Rockefeller university. sharp tack. still jogs several miles
day. really art number things. also super nice guy. Hubel
really nice guy well, also great Frisbee player discovered 'cause
beat game ultimate like 80, still, little bit irked.
anyway, Hubel Wiesel amazing thing science will forever change

32:30 Correcting Errors History

38:15 Adrenalin Alertness

highlight neural circuits stand chance changing. Now not necessarily
case going change, first gate open order

Epinephrin released region brainstem called locus coeruleus. Fancy
name, don't need know unless want to. Locus coeruleus sends
little wires call axons hoses entire brain essentially
neurochemical, epinephrin. Now not always hosing brain epinephrin.
high states alertness epinephrin released. way
circuit designed, nonspecific. essentially waking entire brain
way epinephrin works binding particular receptors
increase likelihood neurons will active. no alertness, no neuroplasticity.
However, alertness alone not sufficient. say, necessary not
sufficient neuroplasticity. know true also work Hubel Wiesel
looked brain plasticity response certain experiences subjects
either awake asleep. hate break cannot just simply
listen things sleep learn materials. Later talk can
certain things sleep unaware can enhance learning things
aware awake. not just listening
music listening tape sleep expecting sink in,
speak. Epinephrin released pay attention alert.

40:18 Acetylcholine Spotlight

important thing getting plasticity there'll epinephrin
equates alertness, plus release neuromodulator, acetylcholine. Now
acetylcholine released two sites brain. One also brainstem
named different things different animals, humans rich site
acetylcholine neurons neurons make acetylcholine parabigeminal nucleus
parabrachial region. number different names aggregates


neurons. don't need know names, need know
area brainstem area sends wires, axons area
brain filters sensory input. area brain called thalamus
getting bombarded sorts sensory input time. Costello snoring off

snoring, create cone attention cone attention reflects
acetylcholine now amplifying signal sounds Costello making
snoring essentially making signal greater signal around it,
call signal-to-noise goes up. engineering background will
familiar signal-to-noise. not engineering background,
don't worry it. means one particular shout crowd comes through,
Costello's snoring becomes salient, apparent relative everything else
going on. Acetylcholine acts spotlight epinephrin alertness. acetylcholine
spotlighting inputs. two things alone not enough get plasticity.
needs third component. third component acetylcholine released
area forebrain called nucleus basalis. really want get technical,
called nucleus basalis Meynert. buddying physicians
going medical school, know that.

44:10 Ways Change Brain

scientific information history protocols can actually apply,
think many interested in. willing bet

terms acetylcholine sport mental acuity, not just plasticity. Now
you, probably don't want chew Nicorette, definitely don't want smoke cigarettes
take supplements increasing acetylcholine. ways can
increase acetylcholine? there, going sound like bit circular argument
increase focus.

53:30 Focus

increase focus? know, people familiar sitting down, reading
couple pages book realizing none sunk talking someone
seeing mouth move, maybe even nodding head subconsciously none
sinks in. can damaging school, work performance relationships
many know. Costello incidentally never seems pay attention anything say
looking directly me, contradicts say,
best way get better focusing use mechanisms focus born
with. key principle mental focus follows visual focus.
familiar fact visual system can unfocused, blurry jumping around
can laser focused one location space. interesting vitally
important understanding access neuroplasticity can use visual
focus can increase visual focus way increasing mental focus
abilities broadly. going explain that. Plasticity starts
alertness. mentioned before, alertness can come sense love,
sense joy, sense fear, doesn't matter. pharmacologic ways access
alertness too. common one course caffeine watch sleep

drink plenty caffeine. heavy user caffeine. don't think abuser caffeine.
think reasonable amounts provided can still fall asleep night, caffeine can
relatively safe way

55:22 Adderall: Use & Abuse

increase epinephrin. Now, many people now also using Adderall. Adderall
chemically looks lot like amphetamine basically amphetamine. will increase
epinephrin release locus coeruleus, will wake brain lot


people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes
prescribed attention deficit. However, also high probability abuse
especially not prescribed it. Adderall will not increase focus,
increases alertness. not touch acetylcholine system.
taking Adderall say, "Well, really increases focus overall", probably
autonomic nervous system just veering towards call
parasympathetic. really just sleepy bringing levels
alertness up. mentioned, Adderall problematic number people
can habit forming. Learning Adderall not always translate high-
performance off Adderall later times. Adderall discussion broader
one perhaps psychiatrist room point
widely abused drug point time.

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog
bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused
anything. Think grazing animals, cows, sheep birds, et cetera.
think bird picking seeds beach concrete. bird's head

eyes, briefly move inward, called vergence eye movement. Now
eyes can't actually translocate head, fixed skull, just like
mine are. move eyes slightly inward, maybe can tell
like basically shortening making inter pupillary distance called smaller.
Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,
activate set neurons brainstem trigger release

looking broadly space, relaxed. eyes move slightly inward toward
particular visual target visual world shrinks, level visual focus goes


know relates release acetylcholine epinephrin relevant

Torsten Wiesel. David Hubel Torsten Wiesel started off Johns Hopkins, moved

followed this. beautiful experiments instance, Gregg
Recanzone's lab UC Davis Mike Merzenich's lab UCSF showing
instance two fingers taped together early development, weren't moving
independently, representation two fingers become fused brain

really need bring immense amount attention whatever want
change. much linked statement made earlier about, starts

Nobel prize certainly deserved it. probably deserved two
also figured vision works. might biased 'cause scientific
great-grandparents think everybody field Neuroscience agrees Hubel
Wiesel, called H&W game, absolutely deserved Nobel

really nice guy well, also great Frisbee player discovered 'cause
beat game ultimate like 80, still, little bit irked.
anyway, Hubel Wiesel amazing thing science will forever change

However, alertness alone not sufficient. say, necessary not

small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog
bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused
anything. Think grazing animals, cows, sheep birds, et cetera.
think bird picking seeds beach concrete. bird's head
here. foot off ground, small bird six inches off
ground eyes side head yet tiny beak can
quickly pick little seeds off ground immense precision. Now, try
staring off sides room picking items front
high precision tiny scale, little tiny objects, will miss almost every time.
perfectly don't smash beak ground damage it,
beautiful movement acuity also. it? create
focus awareness front them? turns lower head,
eyes, briefly move inward, called vergence eye movement. Now
eyes can't actually translocate head, fixed skull, just like
mine are. move eyes slightly inward, maybe can tell
like basically shortening making inter pupillary distance called smaller.
Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,
activate set neurons brainstem trigger release
norepinephrine, epinephrin acetylcholine. Norepinephrine kind similar
epinephrin. words, eyes relaxed head just
kind looking entire visual environment, moving head around, moving
space optic flow, things moving past us sitting still,
looking broadly space, relaxed. eyes move slightly inward toward
particular visual target visual world shrinks, level visual focus goes


know relates release acetylcholine epinephrin relevant
sites brain plasticity. Now, means hard time
focusing mind sake reading listening, need practice can
practice focusing visual system. Now works best practice focusing
visual system precise distance, work intend sake
plasticity. look real world? say, trying concentrate
something related to, don't know, science, reading science paper
hard time, not absorbing. might think looking paper
reading. looking screen, actually eyes probably darting
around bit. Experiments done this. gathering information
many sources visual environment. Now, presumably me, already
coffee, hydrated. well rested, slept well. still experienced
challenges focusing spending just 60 120 seconds focusing visual attention
small window screen, meaning just screen nothing it, bringing
eyes particular location increases not just visual acuity location
brings increase activity bunch brain areas associated
gathering information location. put simply, want improve
ability focus practice visual focus. Now, wear contacts wear corrective
lenses, fine. course want use those. don't want take
off use blurry image. finer visual image can hold

1:02:59 Blinking

gaze visual image, higher levels attention will be. Many times
Instagram teased not blinking often. actually
practiced thing. blink get tired, hear probably just
say, duh. get tired, neurons brainstem responsible alertness
hold eyelids open start falter eyelids start close.
hard, words, "I barely keep eyes open" may feel right
now. assuming paying attention alert, alert,
eyes wide, eyes open. get tired, eyelids start close.
Blinks, actually reset perception time space. shown beautiful
paper Current Biology. sure post reference notes. blinking
course necessary lubricate eyes. People blink eyes might get dry.


can keep focused blinking less focusing eyes particular
location probably pretty creepy experience this.
can can maintain kind cone tunnel
mental focus. sort revealing practice worked hard
blinking contest 14-year-old niece still beats every time
really bothers me, also just self practice learning blink less
focus visual attention smaller region space. Now me, important
mainly learning things computer screen. going
sport, quite bit different can discuss might translate sport.
fact, next episode, going talk plasticity focus
mechanisms relate learning movement practices coordinated movements.
entire discussion unto principle holds. need alertness.
can get mental tricks motivation, fear love, whatever is,
pharmacology, please healthfully. know, caffeine practice,
certainly want well hydrated increases actually will increase alertness. Well,
full bladder will increase alertness although don't want alertness
high can think fact go urinate 'cause
distracting. don't want alertness go roof. need

neurochemicals. Now may ask, well, experiment people
feeling rotating drum

1:05:30 Ear Toward Learning

listening auditory cue doesn't involve vision all? look people
learning things auditory system, will often close eyes.
not coincidence. somebody listening hard, please don't ask look
directly eye also asking listen you. actually one
worst ways get somebody listen you. say, now listen look
eye. visual system will take see mouth move,
going hear thoughts going hear saying. Closing
eyes one best ways create cone auditory attention.
low vision no vision folks do. tremendous capacity focus attention
particular locations.



1:06:14 Best Listeners World

Incidentally anyone know two animals best hearing world?
absolute best hearing many orders magnitude better humans. turns

attention deficit disorder. people actually clinically diagnosed ADD
ADHD. do, certainly work good psychiatrist try figure

easy anchor attention phone following reason. First all,
restricted size. easy limit visual attention something
big. one design features phone. other, just
probably heard picture worth thousand words, well, movie worth 10,000
pictures. Anytime looking things motion, visual motion, attentional
system will naturally gravitate towards them, towards movies. actually much
harder read words page used many people, used
seeing things spelled us YouTube videos videos things move
dramatic. true look motion stimulate,
seeing movies things things dramatic intense,
worst getting attending things like text page listening
something like podcast extracting information much think many
people asked me, "Hey know what, aren't providing intense visuals
us look at?" Well, frankly, lot people consuming content
pure auditory, through, listening. want able digest
material. addition that, think areas life dictate
whether not become successful, independent, healthy individuals,
involve kind boring practices digesting information page. Boring
not exciting moment perhaps watching movie something
spoonfed us. attention can put something, even fleeting
feel like getting little bits pieces, shards information
opposed entire thing, much powerful effect engaging
cholinergic system plasticity does, instance, watching movie.
watch movie, entire thing can great, can awesome.
can overriding experience think experiences,
somebody interested building brain expanding brain getting
better various things, feeling better, better, et cetera, one ask
much neurochemical resources devoting passive experience letting

1:12:00 Ultra(dian) Focus

get epinephrin, alertness, get acetylcholine released
can focus attention. question long? earlier
podcast, talked ultradian cycles lasts 90 minutes. typical
learning 90 minutes. think learning will no doubt
include five 10 minutes warmup period. think everyone give
permission not fully focused early part about. middle
middle hour able maintain focus
hour so. means eliminating distractions. means turning off wifi.
put phone room. find reflexively getting get phone

want try literally maintain visual focus thing trying learn.

1:13:30 Real Change Occurs



Feel free blink, course, can greatly increase powers focus
rates learning anchored work Merzenich, Hubel Wiesel
others. Now trigger plasticity, real secret neuroplasticity
doesn't occur wakefulness. occurs sleep. now know focus
hard something 90 minutes so, maybe even several bouts
per day. can that, people can, people can one focus
learning, night following nights, asleep neural
circuits highlighted will acetylcholine transmission will strengthen
will lost, wonderful essence plasticity.
means eventually wake couple days week later,
will will acquired knowledge forever unless go process
actively unlearn it. will talk unlearning later episode. mastering
sleep key order reinforce learning occurs. say get really
poor night sleep learning. Chances are, sleep next night
following night learning will occur. stamp brain
acetylcholine released. actually marks synapses neurochemically
metabolically, synopses biased change. Now, don't
ever get deep sleep probably won't get changes. also way
can bypass need deep sleep least partially engaging
call Non Sleep Deep Rest, NSDR protocols. just want discuss signs
this. paper published Cell Reports last year shows
people did, spatial memory task, actually quite difficult one
remember sequence lights lighting just two three lights
particular sequence easy get 15 16 lights numbers
sequence actually gets quite challenging. immediately after, immediately
learning actual performance task, people took 20 minute Non Sleep
Deep Rest protocol took shallow nap, lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,
just closing eyes, no sensory input, rates learning significantly higher
information two just good night's sleep following night.
can actually accelerate learning NSDR protocols brief naps, 90
minutes less. key plasticity childhood child.

1:16:20 Much Learning Enough?



key plasticity adulthood engage alertness, engage focus
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest deep sleep typical sleep.
always get asked, "How many bouts learning can perform?" Well, know people
train visual focus mechanisms point can several 90
minute bouts throughout day, many three four. also
inserting Non Sleep Deep Rest well. Now can get pretty tricky.

1:16:50 Learning (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift

lot people find can recover best intense bouts focused
learning motor activity get self-generated optic flow.
make sense ever heard lecture stress done
little bit various podcasts. mode self-generated optic flow like
walking running cycling things just floating past us retina, not
really looking anywhere particular, opposite tight window focus.
that, areas brain like amygdala involved
releasing epinephrin create alertness. extremes, creates fear certainly
alertness, shut down. form non sleep deep rest.
people find much pleasurable practical engage focused
learning go activity involves essentially call
worldlessness not really thinking much anything.
listen audio books podcasts run may want consider
whether not want spend time right now. love
listening podcast run cycle, much interested
actually getting benefits neuroplasticity just listening sake
listening me. many people letting mind drift not organized
thought period deliberate focused effort best way accelerate
learning depth learning. good scientific data support sorts
things,

1:18:16 Synthesis/Summary

including Cell Reports paper mentioned moments ago. want
synthesize information covered now. entire month


neuroplasticity. Today's episode covered lot, no means
covered potential neuroplasticity protocols plasticity. will get
it. today want make sure key elements form backbone
neuroplasticity really embedded people's minds. First all, plasticity occurs
throughout lifespan. Early, birth 25, mere exposure sensory event can
create plasticity. good thing bad thing. going talk
unlearning bad stuff, traumas, et cetera subsequent episode month.
want learn adult, alert. might seem obvious think lot
people don't think 24 hour cycle, alert. four
episodes devoted 24-hour cycle cycles alertness sleep.
encourage listen haven't opportunity yet just ask
day typically tend alert? will afford
advantage learning specific things period time. don't give
period time things meaningless, useless, not aligned goals.
That'd terrible time get passive observance just letting time get
soaked away something. valuable asset, epinephrin, released
brainstem going occur readily particular phases 24-hour cycle
others, waking phase course. know are.
start think behavioral practices, maybe pharmacologic
practices like caffeine, hydration, et cetera will support heightened levels
alertness. Attention something can learned attention critical creating
condition whatever engaging will modify brain
way won't spend much attention going forward.
essence plasticity, things will eventually become reflexive. language
learning, motor movement, cognitive skill, ability suppress
emotional response engage emotional response depending goals
appropriate you. Increasing acetylcholine can accomplished
pharmacologically nicotine. However, certain dangers many people
well cost, financial cost, learning engage cholinergic
system use visual system, practicing long can maintain focus
blinks need them, long can maintain visual focus target,
just piece paper set feet away room level computer
screen. actually things people communities high levels
visual focus necessary. Now, way get high levels visual focus


alertness panic situation very, bad. will
immediately focused everything related situation, unfortunate.
really talking trying harness mechanisms attention get
better paying attention. may want auditory system, not
visual system, either low vision no vision,
trying learn something relates sounds see.
people trying learn information, cognitive information, trying learn
hear nuance partner's explanations emotionally challenging
events, et cetera. just remember, way, said earlier,
really want somebody listen really hear saying
underlying it, not, cannot expect look directly
that. actually going limit ability focus. trying rescue folks
might struggle. course never struggle.
supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus
entire period one 90-minute cycle. beginning end going little bit
flickering focus. know one 90-minute cycles
starting, typically wake os beginning first 90-minute cycle,


not minute. able tap sense 90-minute
cycles start engage learning practices choose.
course getting non sleep deep rest just deliberate disengagement,
walking running, just sitting, eyes closed eyes open kind mindlessly
might seem chair, just letting thoughts move around learning will
accelerate rate plasticity shown quality peer reviewed studies.
course, deep sleep. can start see plasticity
natural right early life. age 25 work order
access it. fortunately, beautiful experiments Hubel Wiesel
Merzenich Weinberger others point direction allows us achieve
plasticity,

1:25:15 Learning Repetition, Forming Habits

points neurochemicals circuits. now behavioral protocols
allow us that. also really want emphasize entire
aspect behavioral practices will allow us engage plasticity don't involve
intense focus emotionality involve lot repetition. another entire
category plasticity involves seemed like almost mundane things
repeatedly incorporating reward system
involves dopamine. today talked kind plasticity comes
extreme focus. get extreme focus alertness naturally
harder, difficult event didn't want. kind stinger brain
designed keep safe wants get one trial learning things like touching
hot stove engaging really horrible person. can get incredible plasticity
positive experiences things want engaging high focus regime
rest, non sleep deep rest, sleep. another aspect plasticity
will explore next episode well explore movement-based practices
enhancing plasticity plasticity movement itself. not high
attention kind high emotionality intensity experiences described
today. repetition reward repeat, repetition, reward,
repeat, used distinctly different category behavioral change
relate habits opposed learning particular types information allow
us perform physically, cognitively adjust emotional system. going stop

23:00 Awareness Cues Brain Change



says recognition something whether not
emotional thing desire learn something else actually first step
neuroplasticity. nervous system two broad sets functions.
functions reflexive. Things like breathing, heart rate,
obvious ones, aspects reflexive like ability walk. get
chair walk door, don't think step taking
learned walk development. decide
going shift sort behavior reaction new piece information
want learn, something want bring consciousness,
awareness remarkable thing cues brain rest nervous
system engage reflexive actions going forward,
reflexive actions no longer fated reflexive. Now sounds little bit
abstract, going talk protocols this. first step
neuroplasticity recognizing want change something
immediately say, well, kids don't go school say, oh, want learn language
want learn social interactions, beauty childhood. whole brain
switch flipped making change possible deliberate.
know exactly want change. don't know exactly
want change, least know want change
something specific experience. case, believe came told
voice really awful listen not make feel bad
reason except wanted not case. knew wasn't going
stop talking. decided call consciousness mine well.
important. want learn something want change nervous system
way, whether not impairment something
want acquire, cognitive skill, motor skill, emotional skill, first thing
recognizing thing is. often can hardest thing identify
brain self recognition mechanisms self recognition mechanisms
not vague, spiritual mystical

25:20 Chemistry Change

even psychological concepts. neurochemicals. going talk next
neurochemicals stamp particular behaviors thoughts


emotional patterns tell rest nervous system, something pay
attention direction change want make.
repeat that, specific chemicals consciously aware
change want make even just want make change, chemicals
released brain allow us opportunity make changes. Now,
specific protocols science tells us follow want changes
occur. self-recognition not kind murky concept. fore
brain, particular prefrontal cortex, signaling rest nervous system

26:15 Giant Lie Universe

something do, hear, feel experience worth paying attention
to. pause going move forward. One biggest lies
universe seems quite prominent right now every experience
changes brain. People love say this. love say, brain going
different lecture brain going different today's class
two days ago. absolutely not true. nervous system doesn't just
change experienced something unless young child.
nervous system changes certain neurochemicals released allow whatever
neurons active period chemicals swimming around,
strengthen weaken connections neurons. Now, best illustrated
little bit scientific history. whole basis neuroplasticity

27:10 Fathers Neuroplasticity/Critical Periods

essentially ascribed two individuals, although lot people
involved work. two individuals go name David Hubel
Torsten Wiesel. David Hubel Torsten Wiesel started off Johns Hopkins, moved
Harvard medical school. seventies eighties, series
experiments, recording electrical activity brain. visual cortex,
meaning put electrodes visual cortex, exploring vision
works visual brain organizes features visual world give us
incredible things call visual perceptions. Hubel physician.
interested happens instance, child comes world


cataract, lens eye, isn't clear opaque. kid
lazy eye eyes called strabismus, eyes either
deviate outward inward. common things childhood, especially
particular areas world. David Torsten figured
critical period clear vision not occur, visual brain
completely rewire itself, basically represent whatever bit visual information
coming in. experiments kind simulate droopy eye deviating
eye close one eyelid found visual brain
respond entirely open eye. sort takeover visual brain
representing open eye. Many experiments many different sensory systems
followed this. beautiful experiments instance, Gregg
Recanzone's lab UC Davis Mike Merzenich's lab UCSF showing
instance two fingers taped together early development, weren't moving
independently, representation two fingers become fused brain
person couldn't actually distinguish movements sensations
two fingers separately, pretty remarkable. say David Torsten's
work, won noble prize, shared Rogers Barry, work
showed

29:30 Competition Route Plasticity

brain fact customized map outside world, said already.
measuring amount activity given part body, one
eye other, fingers, finger finger inputs
competing space brain. Now fundamentally important
means change nervous system adulthood, need think
not just trying get, trying give up. can't actually
add new connections without removing something else. might seem like kind
stinger actually turns great advantage. One key experiments
David Torsten experiment closed eyes,
essentially removed visual input early development. Now slightly different
blindness transient, short period time.
found no change. However, close just
one eye huge change. people tell you, oh end today's


lecture, end something brain going completely different,
simply not true. older 25 brain will not change unless
selective shift attention selective shift experience tells brain
time change. changes occur ways talked
strengthening weakening particular connections, names like long-term
potentiation, long-term depression, nothing emotional depression
way, spike-timing-dependent plasticity. threw names not confuse
you, like in-depth exploration those, please
can go google look up, great Wikipedia pages
can go paper trail. might even touch subsequent
episodes. important thing understand want something change,
really need bring immense amount attention whatever want
change. much linked statement made earlier about, starts
awareness. Now, attention important? Well, David Torsten won
Nobel prize certainly deserved it. probably deserved two
also figured vision works. might biased 'cause scientific
great-grandparents think everybody field Neuroscience agrees Hubel
Wiesel, called H&W game, absolutely deserved Nobel
prize work really unveiled mechanisms brain change
plasticity. David passed away years ago, Torsten still alive, late 90s,
still Rockefeller university. sharp tack. still jogs several miles
day. really art number things. also super nice guy. Hubel
really nice guy well, also great Frisbee player discovered 'cause
beat game ultimate like 80, still, little bit irked.
anyway, Hubel Wiesel amazing thing science will forever change

32:30 Correcting Errors History

way think brain. However, quite wrong critical
period thing. critical period idea deprive nervous
system input, say closing one eye early development rest visual
cortex taken representation open eye, never change
unless intervened early. actually formed basis kid
lazy eye cataract why, even though issues anesthesia


young children, now know want get early fix cataract
fix strabismus ophthalmologists do. However, idea
early else no opportunity rescue nervous system deficit later
turned wasn't entirely true. early 90s, graduate student

33:29 Adult Brain Change: Bumps Beeps

name Gregg Recanzone laboratory guy named Mike Merzenich
UCSF. set test idea one wants change brain,
need early life adult brain simply isn't plastic not available
changes. series absolutely beautiful experiments, now think
can say proving adult brain can change provided certain conditions met.
Now, experiments tough. tough experimenter
tough subject. just describe one. say subject one
experiments. come lab sit table
record image brain look representation fingers
digits call them. spinning drum, literally like stone drum
front metal drum little bumps. bumps spaced close
together, spaced far apart. experiments
expect subjects press lever whenever instance,
bumps got closer together apart subtle differences.
order really pay attention distance bumps
not braille readers anyone skilled kinds experiments.
found people paid attention distance
bumps signal change pressing
lever, rapid changes plasticity representation
fingers. go either direction. get people good detecting
distance bumps, distance getting smaller distance
getting greater. people get good tasks kind
hard imagine translate real world non braille reader.
told us maps touch much available plasticity.
fully adult subjects. not taking specific drugs. don't
impairments aware of. showed, proved adult
brain plastic. beautiful control experiments important


everyone understand sometimes bring people
touch bumps spinning drum
person pay attention auditory cue. Every time tone go off,
shift pitch tone, signal that. subject thought
something related touch hearing showed wasn't
just mere action touching bumps. pay attention bumps
themselves. placing attention auditory cue tone, well
plasticity auditory portion brain not touch portion
brain. really spits face thing hear often every
experience

36:25 Takes Learn

going change way brain works. Absolutely not.
experiences pay super careful attention open plasticity
opens plasticity specific experience. question why?
Merzenich graduate students postdocs went address question
why. turns answer straightforward neurochemical answer.
inside answer opportunity us change brain point
throughout lifespan, essentially anything want learn,
subtracting emotion experience had, building greater
range emotion, learning new information like learning new language.
learning new motor skill, like dance sport combination
cognitive motor. instance, air traffic controller lot mind
addition lot hands. not just cognitive, not just motor
combined. going talk chemical just give
important hint, chemical chemical stress. not discussion
stress per se. future podcast episode, talk stress tools
deal stress, something lab works quite extensively. topic
enjoy discussing. topic brain change. just told
order change brain pay careful attention. immediate question
well, why? Well, answer pay careful attention
two neurochemicals, neuromodulators called, released multiple
sites brain



38:15 Adrenalin Alertness

highlight neural circuits stand chance changing. Now not necessarily
case going change, first gate open order
change occur. first neurochemical epinephrin, also adrenaline. call
adrenaline released adrenal glands kidneys,
body, call epinephrin brain, chemically identical substances.
Epinephrin released region brainstem called locus coeruleus. Fancy
name, don't need know unless want to. Locus coeruleus sends
little wires call axons hoses entire brain essentially
neurochemical, epinephrin. Now not always hosing brain epinephrin.
high states alertness epinephrin released. way
circuit designed, nonspecific. essentially waking entire brain
way epinephrin works binding particular receptors
increase likelihood neurons will active. no alertness, no neuroplasticity.
However, alertness alone not sufficient. say, necessary not
sufficient neuroplasticity. know true also work Hubel Wiesel
looked brain plasticity response certain experiences subjects
either awake asleep. hate break cannot just simply
listen things sleep learn materials. Later talk can
certain things sleep unaware can enhance learning things
aware awake. not just listening
music listening tape sleep expecting sink in,
speak. Epinephrin released pay attention alert.

40:18 Acetylcholine Spotlight

important thing getting plasticity there'll epinephrin
equates alertness, plus release neuromodulator, acetylcholine. Now
acetylcholine released two sites brain. One also brainstem
named different things different animals, humans rich site
acetylcholine neurons neurons make acetylcholine parabigeminal nucleus
parabrachial region. number different names aggregates


neurons. don't need know names, need know
area brainstem area sends wires, axons area
brain filters sensory input. area brain called thalamus
getting bombarded sorts sensory input time. Costello snoring off
right, lights room, presence computer left,
coming in. pay attention something like really hone Costello
snoring, create cone attention cone attention reflects
acetylcholine now amplifying signal sounds Costello making
snoring essentially making signal greater signal around it,
call signal-to-noise goes up. engineering background will
familiar signal-to-noise. not engineering background,
don't worry it. means one particular shout crowd comes through,

you, probably don't want chew Nicorette, definitely don't want smoke cigarettes
take supplements increasing acetylcholine. ways can
increase acetylcholine? there, going sound like bit circular argument
increase focus.

53:30 Focus

increase focus? know, people familiar sitting down, reading
couple pages book realizing none sunk talking someone
seeing mouth move, maybe even nodding head subconsciously none
sinks in. can damaging school, work performance relationships
many know. Costello incidentally never seems pay attention anything say
looking directly me, contradicts say,
best way get better focusing use mechanisms focus born

familiar fact visual system can unfocused, blurry jumping around
can laser focused one location space. interesting vitally
important understanding access neuroplasticity can use visual
focus can increase visual focus way increasing mental focus
abilities broadly. going explain that. Plasticity starts
alertness. mentioned before, alertness can come sense love,
sense joy, sense fear, doesn't matter. pharmacologic ways access
alertness too. common one course caffeine watch sleep

drink plenty caffeine. heavy user caffeine. don't think abuser caffeine.
think reasonable amounts provided can still fall asleep night, caffeine can

55:22 Adderall: Use & Abuse

increase epinephrin. Now, many people now also using Adderall. Adderall
chemically looks lot like amphetamine basically amphetamine. will increase
epinephrin release locus coeruleus, will wake brain lot


people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes
prescribed attention deficit. However, also high probability abuse
especially not prescribed it. Adderall will not increase focus,
increases alertness. not touch acetylcholine system.
taking Adderall say, "Well, really increases focus overall", probably
autonomic nervous system just veering towards call
parasympathetic. really just sleepy bringing levels
alertness up. mentioned, Adderall problematic number people
can habit forming. Learning Adderall not always translate high-
performance off Adderall later times. Adderall discussion broader
one perhaps psychiatrist room point
widely abused drug point time.

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog
bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused
anything. Think grazing animals, cows, sheep birds, et cetera.
think bird picking seeds beach concrete. bird's head

ground eyes side head yet tiny beak can
quickly pick little seeds off ground immense precision. Now, try
staring off sides room picking items front
high precision tiny scale, little tiny objects, will miss almost every time.
perfectly don't smash beak ground damage it,
beautiful movement acuity also. it? create
focus awareness front them? turns lower head,
eyes, briefly move inward, called vergence eye movement. Now
eyes can't actually translocate head, fixed skull, just like
mine are. move eyes slightly inward, maybe can tell
like basically shortening making inter pupillary distance called smaller.
Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,
activate set neurons brainstem trigger release

listening auditory cue doesn't involve vision all? look people
learning things auditory system, will often close eyes.
not coincidence. somebody listening hard, please don't ask look

worst getting attending things like text page listening
something like podcast extracting information much think many
people asked me, "Hey know what, aren't providing intense visuals

1:12:00 Ultra(dian) Focus

get epinephrin, alertness, get acetylcholine released
can focus attention. question long? earlier
podcast, talked ultradian cycles lasts 90 minutes. typical
learning 90 minutes. think learning will no doubt
include five 10 minutes warmup period. think everyone give
permission not fully focused early part about. middle
middle hour able maintain focus

1:13:30 Real Change Occurs



Feel free blink, course, can greatly increase powers focus

poor night sleep learning. Chances are, sleep next night
following night learning will occur. stamp brain

metabolically, synopses biased change. Now, don't
ever get deep sleep probably won't get changes. also way
can bypass need deep sleep least partially engaging
call Non Sleep Deep Rest, NSDR protocols. just want discuss signs
this. paper published Cell Reports last year shows
people did, spatial memory task, actually quite difficult one
remember sequence lights lighting just two three lights
particular sequence easy get 15 16 lights numbers
sequence actually gets quite challenging. immediately after, immediately
learning actual performance task, people took 20 minute Non Sleep
Deep Rest protocol took shallow nap, lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,
just closing eyes, no sensory input, rates learning significantly higher

can actually accelerate learning NSDR protocols brief naps, 90
minutes less. key plasticity childhood child.

1:16:20 Much Learning Enough?



key plasticity adulthood engage alertness, engage focus
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest deep sleep typical sleep.
always get asked, "How many bouts learning can perform?" Well, know people
train visual focus mechanisms point can several 90
minute bouts throughout day, many three four. also
inserting Non Sleep Deep Rest well. Now can get pretty tricky.

1:16:50 Learning (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift

lot people find can recover best intense bouts focused

including Cell Reports paper mentioned moments ago. want
synthesize information covered now. entire month


neuroplasticity. Today's episode covered lot, no means
covered potential neuroplasticity protocols plasticity. will get
it. today want make sure key elements form backbone
neuroplasticity really embedded people's minds. First all, plasticity occurs
throughout lifespan. Early, birth 25, mere exposure sensory event can
create plasticity. good thing bad thing. going talk
unlearning bad stuff, traumas, et cetera subsequent episode month.
want learn adult, alert. might seem obvious think lot
people don't think 24 hour cycle, alert. four
episodes devoted 24-hour cycle cycles alertness sleep.
encourage listen haven't opportunity yet just ask

That'd terrible time get passive observance just letting time get
soaked away something. valuable asset, epinephrin, released

others, waking phase course. know are.
start think behavioral practices, maybe pharmacologic
practices like caffeine, hydration, et cetera will support heightened levels
alertness. Attention something can learned attention critical creating

that. actually going limit ability focus. trying rescue folks
might struggle. course never struggle.
supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus
entire period one 90-minute cycle. beginning end going little bit
flickering focus. know one 90-minute cycles
starting, typically wake os beginning first 90-minute cycle,


not minute. able tap sense 90-minute
cycles start engage learning practices choose.
course getting non sleep deep rest just deliberate disengagement,
walking running, just sitting, eyes closed eyes open kind mindlessly
might seem chair, just letting thoughts move around learning will
accelerate rate plasticity shown quality peer reviewed studies.
course, deep sleep. can start see plasticity

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog
bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused

26:15 Giant Lie Universe

something do, hear, feel experience worth paying attention
to. pause going move forward. One biggest lies
universe seems quite prominent right now every experience
changes brain. People love say this. love say, brain going
different lecture brain going different today's class
two days ago. absolutely not true. nervous system doesn't just
change experienced something unless young child.
nervous system changes certain neurochemicals released allow whatever
neurons active period chemicals swimming around,
strengthen weaken connections neurons. Now, best illustrated
little bit scientific history. whole basis neuroplasticity

27:10 Fathers Neuroplasticity/Critical Periods

essentially ascribed two individuals, although lot people
involved work. two individuals go name David Hubel
Torsten Wiesel. David Hubel Torsten Wiesel started off Johns Hopkins, moved
Harvard medical school. seventies eighties, series
experiments, recording electrical activity brain. visual cortex,
meaning put electrodes visual cortex, exploring vision
works visual brain organizes features visual world give us
incredible things call visual perceptions. Hubel physician.
interested happens instance, child comes world


cataract, lens eye, isn't clear opaque. kid
lazy eye eyes called strabismus, eyes either
deviate outward inward. common things childhood, especially
particular areas world. David Torsten figured
critical period clear vision not occur, visual brain
completely rewire itself, basically represent whatever bit visual information
coming in. experiments kind simulate droopy eye deviating
eye close one eyelid found visual brain
respond entirely open eye. sort takeover visual brain
representing open eye. Many experiments many different sensory systems
followed this. beautiful experiments instance, Gregg
Recanzone's lab UC Davis Mike Merzenich's lab UCSF showing
instance two fingers taped together early development, weren't moving
independently, representation two fingers become fused brain
person couldn't actually distinguish movements sensations
two fingers separately, pretty remarkable. say David Torsten's
work, won noble prize, shared Rogers Barry, work
showed

means change nervous system adulthood, need think
not just trying get, trying give up. can't actually
add new connections without removing something else. might seem like kind
stinger actually turns great advantage. One key experiments
David Torsten experiment closed eyes,
essentially removed visual input early development. Now slightly different
blindness transient, short period time.
found no change. However, close just
one eye huge change. people tell you, oh end today's


lecture, end something brain going completely different,
simply not true. older 25 brain will not change unless
selective shift attention selective shift experience tells brain
time change. changes occur ways talked
strengthening weakening particular connections, names like long-term
potentiation, long-term depression, nothing emotional depression
way, spike-timing-dependent plasticity. threw names not confuse
you, like in-depth exploration those, please
can go google look up, great Wikipedia pages
can go paper trail. might even touch subsequent
episodes. important thing understand want something change,
really need bring immense amount attention whatever want
change. much linked statement made earlier about, starts
awareness. Now, attention important? Well, David Torsten won
Nobel prize certainly deserved it. probably deserved two
also figured vision works. might biased 'cause scientific
great-grandparents think everybody field Neuroscience agrees Hubel
Wiesel, called H&W game, absolutely deserved Nobel
prize work really unveiled mechanisms brain change
plasticity. David passed away years ago, Torsten still alive, late 90s,
still Rockefeller university. sharp tack. still jogs several miles
day. really art number things. also super nice guy. Hubel
really nice guy well, also great Frisbee player discovered 'cause
beat game ultimate like 80, still, little bit irked.
anyway, Hubel Wiesel amazing thing science will forever change

32:30 Correcting Errors History

way think brain. However, quite wrong critical
period thing. critical period idea deprive nervous
system input, say closing one eye early development rest visual
cortex taken representation open eye, never change
unless intervened early. actually formed basis kid
lazy eye cataract why, even though issues anesthesia


young children, now know want get early fix cataract
fix strabismus ophthalmologists do. However, idea
early else no opportunity rescue nervous system deficit later
turned wasn't entirely true. early 90s, graduate student

Now, experiments tough. tough experimenter

Merzenich graduate students postdocs went address question
why. turns answer straightforward neurochemical answer.
inside answer opportunity us change brain point

well, why? Well, answer pay careful attention
two neurochemicals, neuromodulators called, released multiple
sites brain



38:15 Adrenalin Alertness

highlight neural circuits stand chance changing. Now not necessarily
case going change, first gate open order
change occur. first neurochemical epinephrin, also adrenaline. call
adrenaline released adrenal glands kidneys,
body, call epinephrin brain, chemically identical substances.
Epinephrin released region brainstem called locus coeruleus. Fancy
name, don't need know unless want to. Locus coeruleus sends
little wires call axons hoses entire brain essentially
neurochemical, epinephrin. Now not always hosing brain epinephrin.
high states alertness epinephrin released. way
circuit designed, nonspecific. essentially waking entire brain
way epinephrin works binding particular receptors
increase likelihood neurons will active. no alertness, no neuroplasticity.
However, alertness alone not sufficient. say, necessary not
sufficient neuroplasticity. know true also work Hubel Wiesel
looked brain plasticity response certain experiences subjects
either awake asleep. hate break cannot just simply
listen things sleep learn materials. Later talk can
certain things sleep unaware can enhance learning things
aware awake. not just listening
music listening tape sleep expecting sink in,
speak. Epinephrin released pay attention alert.

40:18 Acetylcholine Spotlight

important thing getting plasticity there'll epinephrin
equates alertness, plus release neuromodulator, acetylcholine. Now
acetylcholine released two sites brain. One also brainstem
named different things different animals, humans rich site
acetylcholine neurons neurons make acetylcholine parabigeminal nucleus
parabrachial region. number different names aggregates


neurons. don't need know names, need know
area brainstem area sends wires, axons area
brain filters sensory input. area brain called thalamus
getting bombarded sorts sensory input time. Costello snoring off
right, lights room, presence computer left,
coming in. pay attention something like really hone Costello
snoring, create cone attention cone attention reflects
acetylcholine now amplifying signal sounds Costello making
snoring essentially making signal greater signal around it,
call signal-to-noise goes up. engineering background will
familiar signal-to-noise. not engineering background,
don't worry it. means one particular shout crowd comes through,
Costello's snoring becomes salient, apparent relative everything else
going on. Acetylcholine acts spotlight epinephrin alertness. acetylcholine
spotlighting inputs. two things alone not enough get plasticity.
needs third component. third component acetylcholine released
area forebrain called nucleus basalis. really want get technical,
called nucleus basalis Meynert. buddying physicians
going medical school, know that.

42:26 Chemical Trio Massive Brain Change

acetylcholine released brainstem, acetylcholine released
nucleus basalis epinephrin, can change brain. can say
confidence Merzenich Recanzone well members
Merzenich lab, Michael Kilgard others incredible experiments
stimulated release acetylcholine nucleus basalis either electrode
methods talk about. found
stimulate three brain regions, locus coeruleus, brainstem source
acetylcholine basal forebrain source acetylcholine.
three things whatever happen listening to, paying attention
immediately one trial takes representation particular area brain.
essentially get rapid massive learning one shop. shown
variety papers also guy named Norman Weinberger


UC Irvine. now considered fundamental principle nervous
system works. Hubel Wiesel talked critical periods developmental
plasticity, clear work Merzenich Weinberg others,
get three things, can access three things epinephrin, acetylcholine
two sources, not will nervous system change, change.
absolutely will change. important thing people understand
want change brain. cannot just passively experience things
repetition can important, way use repetition change brain
fundamentally different. now talk translate

44:10 Ways Change Brain

scientific information history protocols can actually apply,
think many interested in. willing bet
not interested lowering electrodes nucleus basalis frankly,
neither I. episode one Huberman Lab Podcast, described various ways
people can monitor change nervous system. ways include brain
machine interface, pharmacology, behavioral practices, behavioral practices
course can include dos, don'ts, don't that, et cetera
thinking neuroplasticity, want frank conversation one
can also acknowledge untapped capacity just not hearing
there, one can also combine behavioral practices pharmacology. One can
combine behavioral practices brain machine interface, don't

46:16 Love, Hate, & Shame: chemical

question access alertness? Well, number ways.
people use pretty elaborate psychological gymnastics. will tell people

standpoint epinephrin getting alert activated, doesn't really matter.
Epinephrin chemical brain not distinguish things
love hate, anger fear. really doesn't, promote autonomic arousal
release epinephrin. think people feeling not motivated
make changes key thing identify not just one

47:30 Dopamine Trap

probably kit reasons, several reasons want make
particular change drawn toward particular goal excited can
one, also motivated not completely afraid, ashamed, humiliated not
following goal another. just want briefly mention one little aside
got friend physician, cardiologist really
interesting theory. just theory, think will resonate lot people,
that, heard molecule dopamine gives us sense reward
accomplish something. Well, also want able access dopamine
working towards things, enjoy process say, 'cause sorts


positive effects gives us energy, et cetera. friend, says is, know,
many many instances someone will come say, "You know
what, going write book." says, "Oh, great. sure book's going
terrific really write book." never go it.
theory is, get much dopamine reward people saying, Oh yeah,
absolutely going able that, might not actually go reward
accomplishment itself. aware positive reinforcements also. not
saying people flagellate point victory whatever
pursuing, motivation tricky one. suggest everyone asks

true. means, however, responsible

49:40 Nicotine Focus

learning create depth focus. important Neuroscience
principles get depth focus. want briefly talk pharmacology first
always get asked this. People say, "What can take increase
levels acetylcholine?" Well, things can take. Nicotine called nicotine
acetylcholine binds nicotinic receptor. two kinds
acetylcholine receptors, muscarinic nicotinic, nicotinic ones involved
attention alertness. colleagues, not my, know kind like bro,
science buddies, friends too, Nobel prize winning colleague

remiss lying didn't say lot people

52:30 Sprinting

using cholinergic drugs order increase level focus. since
coming Olympics, don't want get anyone trouble well aware
fact sprinters really cholinergic drugs not
acetylcholine important focus allows hear gun first
blocks sprints. lot race won, hearing gun
quickest reaction time. take cholinergic agents well
acetylcholine molecule controls nerve muscle contraction. speed
reflexes actually controlled nicotinic transmission well. lots think


terms acetylcholine sport mental acuity, not just plasticity. Now
you, probably don't want chew Nicorette, definitely don't want smoke cigarettes
take supplements increasing acetylcholine. ways can
increase acetylcholine? there, going sound like bit circular argument
increase focus.

53:30 Focus

increase focus? know, people familiar sitting down, reading
couple pages book realizing none sunk talking someone
seeing mouth move, maybe even nodding head subconsciously none
sinks in. can damaging school, work performance relationships
many know. Costello incidentally never seems pay attention anything say
looking directly me, contradicts say,
best way get better focusing use mechanisms focus born
with. key principle mental focus follows visual focus.
familiar fact visual system can unfocused, blurry jumping around
can laser focused one location space. interesting vitally
important understanding access neuroplasticity can use visual
focus can increase visual focus way increasing mental focus
abilities broadly. going explain that. Plasticity starts
alertness. mentioned before, alertness can come sense love,
sense joy, sense fear, doesn't matter. pharmacologic ways access
alertness too. common one course caffeine watch sleep
episodes, know reduces molecule makes us sleepy called adenosine.
drink plenty caffeine. heavy user caffeine. don't think abuser caffeine.
think reasonable amounts provided can still fall asleep night, caffeine can
relatively safe way

55:22 Adderall: Use & Abuse

increase epinephrin. Now, many people now also using Adderall. Adderall
chemically looks lot like amphetamine basically amphetamine. will increase
epinephrin release locus coeruleus, will wake brain lot


people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes
prescribed attention deficit. However, also high probability abuse
especially not prescribed it. Adderall will not increase focus,
increases alertness. not touch acetylcholine system.
taking Adderall say, "Well, really increases focus overall", probably
autonomic nervous system just veering towards call
parasympathetic. really just sleepy bringing levels
alertness up. mentioned, Adderall problematic number people
can habit forming. Learning Adderall not always translate high-
performance off Adderall later times. Adderall discussion broader
one perhaps psychiatrist room point
widely abused drug point time.

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog
bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused
anything. Think grazing animals, cows, sheep birds, et cetera.
think bird picking seeds beach concrete. bird's head
here. foot off ground, small bird six inches off
ground eyes side head yet tiny beak can
quickly pick little seeds off ground immense precision. Now, try
staring off sides room picking items front
high precision tiny scale, little tiny objects, will miss almost every time.
perfectly don't smash beak ground damage it,
beautiful movement acuity also. it? create
focus awareness front them? turns lower head,
eyes, briefly move inward, called vergence eye movement. Now
eyes can't actually translocate head, fixed skull, just like
mine are. move eyes slightly inward, maybe can tell
like basically shortening making inter pupillary distance called smaller.
Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,
activate set neurons brainstem trigger release
norepinephrine, epinephrin acetylcholine. Norepinephrine kind similar
epinephrin. words, eyes relaxed head just
kind looking entire visual environment, moving head around, moving
space optic flow, things moving past us sitting still,
looking broadly space, relaxed. eyes move slightly inward toward
particular visual target visual world shrinks, level visual focus goes


know relates release acetylcholine epinephrin relevant
sites brain plasticity. Now, means hard time
focusing mind sake reading listening, need practice can
practice focusing visual system. Now works best practice focusing
visual system precise distance, work intend sake
plasticity. look real world? say, trying concentrate
something related to, don't know, science, reading science paper
hard time, not absorbing. might think looking paper
reading. looking screen, actually eyes probably darting
around bit. Experiments done this. gathering information
many sources visual environment. Now, presumably me, already
coffee, hydrated. well rested, slept well. still experienced
challenges focusing spending just 60 120 seconds focusing visual attention
small window screen, meaning just screen nothing it, bringing
eyes particular location increases not just visual acuity location
brings increase activity bunch brain areas associated
gathering information location. put simply, want improve
ability focus practice visual focus. Now, wear contacts wear corrective
lenses, fine. course want use those. don't want take
off use blurry image. finer visual image can hold

1:02:59 Blinking

gaze visual image, higher levels attention will be. Many times
Instagram teased not blinking often. actually
practiced thing. blink get tired, hear probably just
say, duh. get tired, neurons brainstem responsible alertness
hold eyelids open start falter eyelids start close.
hard, words, "I barely keep eyes open" may feel right
now. assuming paying attention alert, alert,
eyes wide, eyes open. get tired, eyelids start close.
Blinks, actually reset perception time space. shown beautiful
paper Current Biology. sure post reference notes. blinking
course necessary lubricate eyes. People blink eyes might get dry.


can keep focused blinking less focusing eyes particular

can can maintain kind cone tunnel
mental focus. sort revealing practice worked hard
blinking contest 14-year-old niece still beats every time
really bothers me, also just self practice learning blink less

1:05:30 Ear Toward Learning

listening auditory cue doesn't involve vision all? look people
learning things auditory system, will often close eyes.
not coincidence. somebody listening hard, please don't ask look
directly eye also asking listen you. actually one
worst ways get somebody listen you. say, now listen look
eye. visual system will take see mouth move,
going hear thoughts going hear saying. Closing
eyes one best ways create cone auditory attention.
low vision no vision folks do. tremendous capacity focus attention

harder read words page used many people, used
seeing things spelled us YouTube videos videos things move
dramatic. true look motion stimulate,
seeing movies things things dramatic intense,
worst getting attending things like text page listening
something like podcast extracting information much think many
people asked me, "Hey know what, aren't providing intense visuals
us look at?" Well, frankly, lot people consuming content
pure auditory, through, listening. want able digest

whether not become successful, independent, healthy individuals,
involve kind boring practices digesting information page. Boring
not exciting moment perhaps watching movie something
spoonfed us. attention can put something, even fleeting
feel like getting little bits pieces, shards information

watch movie, entire thing can great, can awesome.
can overriding experience think experiences,
somebody interested building brain expanding brain getting

27:10 Fathers Neuroplasticity/Critical Periods

essentially ascribed two individuals, although lot people
involved work. two individuals go name David Hubel
Torsten Wiesel. David Hubel Torsten Wiesel started off Johns Hopkins, moved
Harvard medical school. seventies eighties, series
experiments, recording electrical activity brain. visual cortex,

representing open eye. Many experiments many different sensory systems
followed this. beautiful experiments instance, Gregg
Recanzone's lab UC Davis Mike Merzenich's lab UCSF showing
instance two fingers taped together early development, weren't moving
independently, representation two fingers become fused brain

Nobel prize certainly deserved it. probably deserved two
also figured vision works. might biased 'cause scientific
great-grandparents think everybody field Neuroscience agrees Hubel
Wiesel, called H&W game, absolutely deserved Nobel

high states alertness epinephrin released. way
circuit designed, nonspecific. essentially waking entire brain
way epinephrin works binding particular receptors
increase likelihood neurons will active. no alertness, no neuroplasticity.
However, alertness alone not sufficient. say, necessary not
sufficient neuroplasticity. know true also work Hubel Wiesel
looked brain plasticity response certain experiences subjects

40:18 Acetylcholine Spotlight

important thing getting plasticity there'll epinephrin
equates alertness, plus release neuromodulator, acetylcholine. Now
acetylcholine released two sites brain. One also brainstem

increase focus.

53:30 Focus

increase focus? know, people familiar sitting down, reading
couple pages book realizing none sunk talking someone
seeing mouth move, maybe even nodding head subconsciously none
sinks in. can damaging school, work performance relationships
many know. Costello incidentally never seems pay attention anything say
looking directly me, contradicts say,
best way get better focusing use mechanisms focus born
with. key principle mental focus follows visual focus.
familiar fact visual system can unfocused, blurry jumping around
can laser focused one location space. interesting vitally
important understanding access neuroplasticity can use visual
focus can increase visual focus way increasing mental focus
abilities broadly. going explain that. Plasticity starts
alertness. mentioned before, alertness can come sense love,
sense joy, sense fear, doesn't matter. pharmacologic ways access
alertness too. common one course caffeine watch sleep
episodes, know reduces molecule makes us sleepy called adenosine.
drink plenty caffeine. heavy user caffeine. don't think abuser caffeine.
think reasonable amounts provided can still fall asleep night, caffeine can
relatively safe way

55:22 Adderall: Use & Abuse

increase epinephrin. Now, many people now also using Adderall. Adderall
chemically looks lot like amphetamine basically amphetamine. will increase
epinephrin release locus coeruleus, will wake brain lot


people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes
prescribed attention deficit. However, also high probability abuse
especially not prescribed it. Adderall will not increase focus,
increases alertness. not touch acetylcholine system.
taking Adderall say, "Well, really increases focus overall", probably
autonomic nervous system just veering towards call
parasympathetic. really just sleepy bringing levels
alertness up. mentioned, Adderall problematic number people
can habit forming. Learning Adderall not always translate high-
performance off Adderall later times. Adderall discussion broader
one perhaps psychiatrist room point
widely abused drug point time.

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved

density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog

world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side

Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,

listening auditory cue doesn't involve vision all? look people
learning things auditory system, will often close eyes.
not coincidence. somebody listening hard, please don't ask look

1:13:30 Real Change Occurs



Feel free blink, course, can greatly increase powers focus
rates learning anchored work Merzenich, Hubel Wiesel

learning, night following nights, asleep neural
circuits highlighted will acetylcholine transmission will strengthen
will lost, wonderful essence plasticity.
means eventually wake couple days week later,
will will acquired knowledge forever unless go process
actively unlearn it. will talk unlearning later episode. mastering
sleep key order reinforce learning occurs. say get really
poor night sleep learning. Chances are, sleep next night
following night learning will occur. stamp brain
acetylcholine released. actually marks synapses neurochemically
metabolically, synopses biased change. Now, don't
ever get deep sleep probably won't get changes. also way
can bypass need deep sleep least partially engaging
call Non Sleep Deep Rest, NSDR protocols. just want discuss signs
this. paper published Cell Reports last year shows
people did, spatial memory task, actually quite difficult one
remember sequence lights lighting just two three lights
particular sequence easy get 15 16 lights numbers
sequence actually gets quite challenging. immediately after, immediately
learning actual performance task, people took 20 minute Non Sleep
Deep Rest protocol took shallow nap, lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,
just closing eyes, no sensory input, rates learning significantly higher

can actually accelerate learning NSDR protocols brief naps, 90
minutes less. key plasticity childhood child.

1:16:20 Much Learning Enough?



key plasticity adulthood engage alertness, engage focus
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest deep sleep typical sleep.
always get asked, "How many bouts learning can perform?" Well, know people
train visual focus mechanisms point can several 90
minute bouts throughout day, many three four. also
inserting Non Sleep Deep Rest well. Now can get pretty tricky.

1:16:50 Learning (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift

lot people find can recover best intense bouts focused
learning motor activity get self-generated optic flow.
make sense ever heard lecture stress done
little bit various podcasts. mode self-generated optic flow like
walking running cycling things just floating past us retina, not
really looking anywhere particular, opposite tight window focus.
that, areas brain like amygdala involved

1:18:16 Synthesis/Summary

including Cell Reports paper mentioned moments ago. want
synthesize information covered now. entire month


neuroplasticity. Today's episode covered lot, no means
covered potential neuroplasticity protocols plasticity. will get
it. today want make sure key elements form backbone
neuroplasticity really embedded people's minds. First all, plasticity occurs
throughout lifespan. Early, birth 25, mere exposure sensory event can
create plasticity. good thing bad thing. going talk
unlearning bad stuff, traumas, et cetera subsequent episode month.
want learn adult, alert. might seem obvious think lot
people don't think 24 hour cycle, alert. four
episodes devoted 24-hour cycle cycles alertness sleep.
encourage listen haven't opportunity yet just ask
day typically tend alert? will afford
advantage learning specific things period time. don't give
period time things meaningless, useless, not aligned goals.
That'd terrible time get passive observance just letting time get
soaked away something. valuable asset, epinephrin, released
brainstem going occur readily particular phases 24-hour cycle
others, waking phase course. know are.
start think behavioral practices, maybe pharmacologic
practices like caffeine, hydration, et cetera will support heightened levels
alertness. Attention something can learned attention critical creating
condition whatever engaging will modify brain
way won't spend much attention going forward.
essence plasticity, things will eventually become reflexive. language
learning, motor movement, cognitive skill, ability suppress
emotional response engage emotional response depending goals
appropriate you. Increasing acetylcholine can accomplished
pharmacologically nicotine. However, certain dangers many people
well cost, financial cost, learning engage cholinergic
system use visual system, practicing long can maintain focus
blinks need them, long can maintain visual focus target,
just piece paper set feet away room level computer
screen. actually things people communities high levels
visual focus necessary. Now, way get high levels visual focus


alertness panic situation very, bad. will
immediately focused everything related situation, unfortunate.
really talking trying harness mechanisms attention get
better paying attention. may want auditory system, not
visual system, either low vision no vision,
trying learn something relates sounds see.
people trying learn information, cognitive information, trying learn
hear nuance partner's explanations emotionally challenging
events, et cetera. just remember, way, said earlier,
really want somebody listen really hear saying
underlying it, not, cannot expect look directly
that. actually going limit ability focus. trying rescue folks
might struggle. course never struggle.
supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus
entire period one 90-minute cycle. beginning end going little bit
flickering focus. know one 90-minute cycles
starting, typically wake os beginning first 90-minute cycle,


not minute. able tap sense 90-minute
cycles start engage learning practices choose.
course getting non sleep deep rest just deliberate disengagement,
walking running, just sitting, eyes closed eyes open kind mindlessly
might seem chair, just letting thoughts move around learning will
accelerate rate plasticity shown quality peer reviewed studies.
course, deep sleep. can start see plasticity
natural right early life. age 25 work order
access it. fortunately, beautiful experiments Hubel Wiesel
Merzenich Weinberger others point direction allows us achieve
plasticity,

1:25:15 Learning Repetition, Forming Habits

Merzenich graduate students postdocs went address question
why. turns answer straightforward neurochemical answer.
inside answer opportunity us change brain point

well, why? Well, answer pay careful attention
two neurochemicals, neuromodulators called, released multiple

38:15 Adrenalin Alertness

highlight neural circuits stand chance changing. Now not necessarily
case going change, first gate open order
change occur. first neurochemical epinephrin, also adrenaline. call
adrenaline released adrenal glands kidneys,
body, call epinephrin brain, chemically identical substances.
Epinephrin released region brainstem called locus coeruleus. Fancy
name, don't need know unless want to. Locus coeruleus sends
little wires call axons hoses entire brain essentially
neurochemical, epinephrin. Now not always hosing brain epinephrin.
high states alertness epinephrin released. way
circuit designed, nonspecific. essentially waking entire brain
way epinephrin works binding particular receptors
increase likelihood neurons will active. no alertness, no neuroplasticity.
However, alertness alone not sufficient. say, necessary not
sufficient neuroplasticity. know true also work Hubel Wiesel
looked brain plasticity response certain experiences subjects
either awake asleep. hate break cannot just simply
listen things sleep learn materials. Later talk can
certain things sleep unaware can enhance learning things
aware awake. not just listening
music listening tape sleep expecting sink in,
speak. Epinephrin released pay attention alert.

40:18 Acetylcholine Spotlight

important thing getting plasticity there'll epinephrin
equates alertness, plus release neuromodulator, acetylcholine. Now
acetylcholine released two sites brain. One also brainstem
named different things different animals, humans rich site
acetylcholine neurons neurons make acetylcholine parabigeminal nucleus
parabrachial region. number different names aggregates


neurons. don't need know names, need know
area brainstem area sends wires, axons area
brain filters sensory input. area brain called thalamus
getting bombarded sorts sensory input time. Costello snoring off

snoring, create cone attention cone attention reflects
acetylcholine now amplifying signal sounds Costello making
snoring essentially making signal greater signal around it,
call signal-to-noise goes up. engineering background will
familiar signal-to-noise. not engineering background,
don't worry it. means one particular shout crowd comes through,
Costello's snoring becomes salient, apparent relative everything else
going on. Acetylcholine acts spotlight epinephrin alertness. acetylcholine
spotlighting inputs. two things alone not enough get plasticity.

44:10 Ways Change Brain

scientific information history protocols can actually apply,
think many interested in. willing bet
not interested lowering electrodes nucleus basalis frankly,
neither I. episode one Huberman Lab Podcast, described various ways
people can monitor change nervous system. ways include brain
machine interface, pharmacology, behavioral practices, behavioral practices

47:30 Dopamine Trap

probably kit reasons, several reasons want make

got friend physician, cardiologist really
interesting theory. just theory, think will resonate lot people,
that, heard molecule dopamine gives us sense reward
accomplish something. Well, also want able access dopamine
working towards things, enjoy process say, 'cause sorts


positive effects gives us energy, et cetera. friend, says is, know,
many many instances someone will come say, "You know
what, going write book." says, "Oh, great. sure book's going
terrific really write book." never go it.
theory is, get much dopamine reward people saying, Oh yeah,
absolutely going able that, might not actually go reward
accomplishment itself. aware positive reinforcements also. not

49:40 Nicotine Focus

learning create depth focus. important Neuroscience
principles get depth focus. want briefly talk pharmacology first
always get asked this. People say, "What can take increase
levels acetylcholine?" Well, things can take. Nicotine called nicotine
acetylcholine binds nicotinic receptor. two kinds
acetylcholine receptors, muscarinic nicotinic, nicotinic ones involved
attention alertness. colleagues, not my, know kind like bro,

fact sprinters really cholinergic drugs not
acetylcholine important focus allows hear gun first
blocks sprints. lot race won, hearing gun
quickest reaction time. take cholinergic agents well
acetylcholine molecule controls nerve muscle contraction. speed
reflexes actually controlled nicotinic transmission well. lots think


terms acetylcholine sport mental acuity, not just plasticity. Now
you, probably don't want chew Nicorette, definitely don't want smoke cigarettes
take supplements increasing acetylcholine. ways can
increase acetylcholine? there, going sound like bit circular argument
increase focus.

53:30 Focus

increase focus? know, people familiar sitting down, reading
couple pages book realizing none sunk talking someone
seeing mouth move, maybe even nodding head subconsciously none
sinks in. can damaging school, work performance relationships
many know. Costello incidentally never seems pay attention anything say
looking directly me, contradicts say,
best way get better focusing use mechanisms focus born
with. key principle mental focus follows visual focus.
familiar fact visual system can unfocused, blurry jumping around
can laser focused one location space. interesting vitally
important understanding access neuroplasticity can use visual
focus can increase visual focus way increasing mental focus
abilities broadly. going explain that. Plasticity starts
alertness. mentioned before, alertness can come sense love,
sense joy, sense fear, doesn't matter. pharmacologic ways access
alertness too. common one course caffeine watch sleep
episodes, know reduces molecule makes us sleepy called adenosine.
drink plenty caffeine. heavy user caffeine. don't think abuser caffeine.
think reasonable amounts provided can still fall asleep night, caffeine can
relatively safe way

55:22 Adderall: Use & Abuse

increase epinephrin. Now, many people now also using Adderall. Adderall
chemically looks lot like amphetamine basically amphetamine. will increase
epinephrin release locus coeruleus, will wake brain lot


people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes
prescribed attention deficit. However, also high probability abuse
especially not prescribed it. Adderall will not increase focus,
increases alertness. not touch acetylcholine system.
taking Adderall say, "Well, really increases focus overall", probably
autonomic nervous system just veering towards call
parasympathetic. really just sleepy bringing levels
alertness up. mentioned, Adderall problematic number people
can habit forming. Learning Adderall not always translate high-
performance off Adderall later times. Adderall discussion broader
one perhaps psychiatrist room point
widely abused drug point time.

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned

bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused
anything. Think grazing animals, cows, sheep birds, et cetera.
think bird picking seeds beach concrete. bird's head
here. foot off ground, small bird six inches off
ground eyes side head yet tiny beak can
quickly pick little seeds off ground immense precision. Now, try
staring off sides room picking items front
high precision tiny scale, little tiny objects, will miss almost every time.
perfectly don't smash beak ground damage it,
beautiful movement acuity also. it? create
focus awareness front them? turns lower head,
eyes, briefly move inward, called vergence eye movement. Now
eyes can't actually translocate head, fixed skull, just like
mine are. move eyes slightly inward, maybe can tell
like basically shortening making inter pupillary distance called smaller.
Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,
activate set neurons brainstem trigger release
norepinephrine, epinephrin acetylcholine. Norepinephrine kind similar
epinephrin. words, eyes relaxed head just
kind looking entire visual environment, moving head around, moving
space optic flow, things moving past us sitting still,
looking broadly space, relaxed. eyes move slightly inward toward
particular visual target visual world shrinks, level visual focus goes


know relates release acetylcholine epinephrin relevant
sites brain plasticity. Now, means hard time
focusing mind sake reading listening, need practice can
practice focusing visual system. Now works best practice focusing
visual system precise distance, work intend sake
plasticity. look real world? say, trying concentrate
something related to, don't know, science, reading science paper
hard time, not absorbing. might think looking paper
reading. looking screen, actually eyes probably darting
around bit. Experiments done this. gathering information
many sources visual environment. Now, presumably me, already
coffee, hydrated. well rested, slept well. still experienced
challenges focusing spending just 60 120 seconds focusing visual attention
small window screen, meaning just screen nothing it, bringing
eyes particular location increases not just visual acuity location
brings increase activity bunch brain areas associated
gathering information location. put simply, want improve
ability focus practice visual focus. Now, wear contacts wear corrective
lenses, fine. course want use those. don't want take
off use blurry image. finer visual image can hold

1:02:59 Blinking

gaze visual image, higher levels attention will be. Many times
Instagram teased not blinking often. actually
practiced thing. blink get tired, hear probably just
say, duh. get tired, neurons brainstem responsible alertness
hold eyelids open start falter eyelids start close.
hard, words, "I barely keep eyes open" may feel right
now. assuming paying attention alert, alert,
eyes wide, eyes open. get tired, eyelids start close.
Blinks, actually reset perception time space. shown beautiful
paper Current Biology. sure post reference notes. blinking
course necessary lubricate eyes. People blink eyes might get dry.


can keep focused blinking less focusing eyes particular
location probably pretty creepy experience this.
can can maintain kind cone tunnel
mental focus. sort revealing practice worked hard
blinking contest 14-year-old niece still beats every time
really bothers me, also just self practice learning blink less
focus visual attention smaller region space. Now me, important
mainly learning things computer screen. going
sport, quite bit different can discuss might translate sport.
fact, next episode, going talk plasticity focus
mechanisms relate learning movement practices coordinated movements.
entire discussion unto principle holds. need alertness.
can get mental tricks motivation, fear love, whatever is,
pharmacology, please healthfully. know, caffeine practice,
certainly want well hydrated increases actually will increase alertness. Well,
full bladder will increase alertness although don't want alertness
high can think fact go urinate 'cause
distracting. don't want alertness go roof. need
focus visual focus primary way start deploy
neurochemicals. Now may ask, well, experiment people
feeling rotating drum

1:05:30 Ear Toward Learning

listening auditory cue doesn't involve vision all? look people
learning things auditory system, will often close eyes.
not coincidence. somebody listening hard, please don't ask look
directly eye also asking listen you. actually one
worst ways get somebody listen you. say, now listen look
eye. visual system will take see mouth move,
going hear thoughts going hear saying. Closing
eyes one best ways create cone auditory attention.
low vision no vision folks do. tremendous capacity focus attention
particular locations.

1:07:40 ADHD & ADD: Attention Deficit (Hyperactivity) Disorder

goal learn control visual window sake controlling
focus, can immensely powerful portal mechanisms plasticity,
know engages things like nucleus basalis brainstem
mechanisms. get lot questions attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD,
attention deficit disorder. people actually clinically diagnosed ADD
ADHD. do, certainly work good psychiatrist try figure
right pharmacology and/or behavioral practices you. Many people, however,


given low grade ADHD ADD way move
world. looking phone lot time. actually
easy anchor attention phone following reason. First all,
restricted size. easy limit visual attention something
big. one design features phone. other, just
probably heard picture worth thousand words, well, movie worth 10,000
pictures. Anytime looking things motion, visual motion, attentional
system will naturally gravitate towards them, towards movies. actually much
harder read words page used many people, used
seeing things spelled us YouTube videos videos things move
dramatic. true look motion stimulate,
seeing movies things things dramatic intense,
worst getting attending things like text page listening
something like podcast extracting information much think many
people asked me, "Hey know what, aren't providing intense visuals
us look at?" Well, frankly, lot people consuming content
pure auditory, through, listening. want able digest
material. addition that, think areas life dictate
whether not become successful, independent, healthy individuals,
involve kind boring practices digesting information page. Boring
not exciting moment perhaps watching movie something
spoonfed us. attention can put something, even fleeting
feel like getting little bits pieces, shards information
opposed entire thing, much powerful effect engaging
cholinergic system plasticity does, instance, watching movie.
watch movie, entire thing can great, can awesome.
can overriding experience think experiences,
somebody interested building brain expanding brain getting
better various things, feeling better, better, et cetera, one ask
much neurochemical resources devoting passive experience letting
something, just kind overwhelm excite me, versus something really
trying learn take away. now another enjoy movie content TV

1:12:00 Ultra(dian) Focus

get epinephrin, alertness, get acetylcholine released
can focus attention. question long? earlier
podcast, talked ultradian cycles lasts 90 minutes. typical
learning 90 minutes. think learning will no doubt
include five 10 minutes warmup period. think everyone give
permission not fully focused early part about. middle
middle hour able maintain focus
hour so. means eliminating distractions. means turning off wifi.
put phone room. find reflexively getting get phone

want try literally maintain visual focus thing trying learn.

1:13:30 Real Change Occurs



Feel free blink, course, can greatly increase powers focus
rates learning anchored work Merzenich, Hubel Wiesel
others. Now trigger plasticity, real secret neuroplasticity
doesn't occur wakefulness. occurs sleep. now know focus
hard something 90 minutes so, maybe even several bouts
per day. can that, people can, people can one focus
learning, night following nights, asleep neural
circuits highlighted will acetylcholine transmission will strengthen
will lost, wonderful essence plasticity.
means eventually wake couple days week later,
will will acquired knowledge forever unless go process
actively unlearn it. will talk unlearning later episode. mastering
sleep key order reinforce learning occurs. say get really
poor night sleep learning. Chances are, sleep next night
following night learning will occur. stamp brain
acetylcholine released. actually marks synapses neurochemically
metabolically, synopses biased change. Now, don't
ever get deep sleep probably won't get changes. also way
can bypass need deep sleep least partially engaging
call Non Sleep Deep Rest, NSDR protocols. just want discuss signs
this. paper published Cell Reports last year shows
people did, spatial memory task, actually quite difficult one
remember sequence lights lighting just two three lights
particular sequence easy get 15 16 lights numbers
sequence actually gets quite challenging. immediately after, immediately
learning actual performance task, people took 20 minute Non Sleep
Deep Rest protocol took shallow nap, lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,
just closing eyes, no sensory input, rates learning significantly higher
information two just good night's sleep following night.
can actually accelerate learning NSDR protocols brief naps, 90
minutes less. key plasticity childhood child.

1:16:20 Much Learning Enough?



key plasticity adulthood engage alertness, engage focus
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest deep sleep typical sleep.
always get asked, "How many bouts learning can perform?" Well, know people
train visual focus mechanisms point can several 90
minute bouts throughout day, many three four. also
inserting Non Sleep Deep Rest well. Now can get pretty tricky.

1:16:50 Learning (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift

lot people find can recover best intense bouts focused
learning motor activity get self-generated optic flow.
make sense ever heard lecture stress done
little bit various podcasts. mode self-generated optic flow like
walking running cycling things just floating past us retina, not
really looking anywhere particular, opposite tight window focus.
that, areas brain like amygdala involved
releasing epinephrin create alertness. extremes, creates fear certainly
alertness, shut down. form non sleep deep rest.
people find much pleasurable practical engage focused
learning go activity involves essentially call
worldlessness not really thinking much anything.
listen audio books podcasts run may want consider
whether not want spend time right now. love
listening podcast run cycle, much interested
actually getting benefits neuroplasticity just listening sake
listening me. many people letting mind drift not organized
thought period deliberate focused effort best way accelerate
learning depth learning. good scientific data support sorts
things,

1:18:16 Synthesis/Summary

including Cell Reports paper mentioned moments ago. want
synthesize information covered now. entire month


neuroplasticity. Today's episode covered lot, no means
covered potential neuroplasticity protocols plasticity. will get
it. today want make sure key elements form backbone
neuroplasticity really embedded people's minds. First all, plasticity occurs
throughout lifespan. Early, birth 25, mere exposure sensory event can
create plasticity. good thing bad thing. going talk
unlearning bad stuff, traumas, et cetera subsequent episode month.
want learn adult, alert. might seem obvious think lot
people don't think 24 hour cycle, alert. four
episodes devoted 24-hour cycle cycles alertness sleep.
encourage listen haven't opportunity yet just ask
day typically tend alert? will afford
advantage learning specific things period time. don't give
period time things meaningless, useless, not aligned goals.
That'd terrible time get passive observance just letting time get
soaked away something. valuable asset, epinephrin, released
brainstem going occur readily particular phases 24-hour cycle
others, waking phase course. know are.
start think behavioral practices, maybe pharmacologic
practices like caffeine, hydration, et cetera will support heightened levels
alertness. Attention something can learned attention critical creating
condition whatever engaging will modify brain
way won't spend much attention going forward.
essence plasticity, things will eventually become reflexive. language
learning, motor movement, cognitive skill, ability suppress
emotional response engage emotional response depending goals
appropriate you. Increasing acetylcholine can accomplished
pharmacologically nicotine. However, certain dangers many people
well cost, financial cost, learning engage cholinergic
system use visual system, practicing long can maintain focus
blinks need them, long can maintain visual focus target,
just piece paper set feet away room level computer
screen. actually things people communities high levels
visual focus necessary. Now, way get high levels visual focus


alertness panic situation very, bad. will
immediately focused everything related situation, unfortunate.
really talking trying harness mechanisms attention get
better paying attention. may want auditory system, not
visual system, either low vision no vision,
trying learn something relates sounds see.
people trying learn information, cognitive information, trying learn
hear nuance partner's explanations emotionally challenging
events, et cetera. just remember, way, said earlier,
really want somebody listen really hear saying
underlying it, not, cannot expect look directly
that. actually going limit ability focus. trying rescue folks
might struggle. course never struggle.
supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus
entire period one 90-minute cycle. beginning end going little bit
flickering focus. know one 90-minute cycles
starting, typically wake os beginning first 90-minute cycle,


not minute. able tap sense 90-minute
cycles start engage learning practices choose.
course getting non sleep deep rest just deliberate disengagement,
walking running, just sitting, eyes closed eyes open kind mindlessly
might seem chair, just letting thoughts move around learning will
accelerate rate plasticity shown quality peer reviewed studies.
course, deep sleep. can start see plasticity
natural right early life. age 25 work order
access it. fortunately, beautiful experiments Hubel Wiesel
Merzenich Weinberger others point direction allows us achieve
plasticity,

1:25:15 Learning Repetition, Forming Habits

points neurochemicals circuits. now behavioral protocols
allow us that. also really want emphasize entire
aspect behavioral practices will allow us engage plasticity don't involve
intense focus emotionality involve lot repetition. another entire
category plasticity involves seemed like almost mundane things
repeatedly incorporating reward system
involves dopamine. today talked kind plasticity comes
extreme focus. get extreme focus alertness naturally
harder, difficult event didn't want. kind stinger brain
designed keep safe wants get one trial learning things like touching
hot stove engaging really horrible person. can get incredible plasticity
positive experiences things want engaging high focus regime
rest, non sleep deep rest, sleep. another aspect plasticity
will explore next episode well explore movement-based practices
enhancing plasticity plasticity movement itself. not high
attention kind high emotionality intensity experiences described
today. repetition reward repeat, repetition, reward,
repeat, used distinctly different category behavioral change
relate habits opposed learning particular types information allow
us perform physically, cognitively adjust emotional system. going stop

lecture, end something brain going completely different,
simply not true. older 25 brain will not change unless
selective shift attention selective shift experience tells brain
time change. changes occur ways talked
strengthening weakening particular connections, names like long-term
potentiation, long-term depression, nothing emotional depression
way, spike-timing-dependent plasticity. threw names not confuse
you, like in-depth exploration those, please
can go google look up, great Wikipedia pages
can go paper trail. might even touch subsequent
episodes. important thing understand want something change,
really need bring immense amount attention whatever want
change. much linked statement made earlier about, starts
awareness. Now, attention important? Well, David Torsten won
Nobel prize certainly deserved it. probably deserved two
also figured vision works. might biased 'cause scientific
great-grandparents think everybody field Neuroscience agrees Hubel
Wiesel, called H&W game, absolutely deserved Nobel
prize work really unveiled mechanisms brain change
plasticity. David passed away years ago, Torsten still alive, late 90s,
still Rockefeller university. sharp tack. still jogs several miles
day. really art number things. also super nice guy. Hubel
really nice guy well, also great Frisbee player discovered 'cause
beat game ultimate like 80, still, little bit irked.
anyway, Hubel Wiesel amazing thing science will forever change

32:30 Correcting Errors History

way think brain. However, quite wrong critical
period thing. critical period idea deprive nervous
system input, say closing one eye early development rest visual
cortex taken representation open eye, never change
unless intervened early. actually formed basis kid
lazy eye cataract why, even though issues anesthesia


young children, now know want get early fix cataract
fix strabismus ophthalmologists do. However, idea
early else no opportunity rescue nervous system deficit later
turned wasn't entirely true. early 90s, graduate student

33:29 Adult Brain Change: Bumps Beeps

name Gregg Recanzone laboratory guy named Mike Merzenich
UCSF. set test idea one wants change brain,
need early life adult brain simply isn't plastic not available
changes. series absolutely beautiful experiments, now think
can say proving adult brain can change provided certain conditions met.
Now, experiments tough. tough experimenter
tough subject. just describe one. say subject one
experiments. come lab sit table
record image brain look representation fingers
digits call them. spinning drum, literally like stone drum
front metal drum little bumps. bumps spaced close
together, spaced far apart. experiments
expect subjects press lever whenever instance,
bumps got closer together apart subtle differences.
order really pay attention distance bumps
not braille readers anyone skilled kinds experiments.
found people paid attention distance
bumps signal change pressing
lever, rapid changes plasticity representation
fingers. go either direction. get people good detecting
distance bumps, distance getting smaller distance
getting greater. people get good tasks kind
hard imagine translate real world non braille reader.
told us maps touch much available plasticity.
fully adult subjects. not taking specific drugs. don't
impairments aware of. showed, proved adult
brain plastic. beautiful control experiments important


everyone understand sometimes bring people
touch bumps spinning drum
person pay attention auditory cue. Every time tone go off,
shift pitch tone, signal that. subject thought
something related touch hearing showed wasn't
just mere action touching bumps. pay attention bumps
themselves. placing attention auditory cue tone, well
plasticity auditory portion brain not touch portion
brain. really spits face thing hear often every
experience

36:25 Takes Learn

going change way brain works. Absolutely not.
experiences pay super careful attention open plasticity
opens plasticity specific experience. question why?
Merzenich graduate students postdocs went address question
why. turns answer straightforward neurochemical answer.
inside answer opportunity us change brain point
throughout lifespan, essentially anything want learn,
subtracting emotion experience had, building greater
range emotion, learning new information like learning new language.
learning new motor skill, like dance sport combination
cognitive motor. instance, air traffic controller lot mind
addition lot hands. not just cognitive, not just motor
combined. going talk chemical just give
important hint, chemical chemical stress. not discussion
stress per se. future podcast episode, talk stress tools
deal stress, something lab works quite extensively. topic
enjoy discussing. topic brain change. just told
order change brain pay careful attention. immediate question
well, why? Well, answer pay careful attention
two neurochemicals, neuromodulators called, released multiple
sites brain



38:15 Adrenalin Alertness

highlight neural circuits stand chance changing. Now not necessarily
case going change, first gate open order
change occur. first neurochemical epinephrin, also adrenaline. call
adrenaline released adrenal glands kidneys,
body, call epinephrin brain, chemically identical substances.
Epinephrin released region brainstem called locus coeruleus. Fancy
name, don't need know unless want to. Locus coeruleus sends
little wires call axons hoses entire brain essentially
neurochemical, epinephrin. Now not always hosing brain epinephrin.
high states alertness epinephrin released. way
circuit designed, nonspecific. essentially waking entire brain
way epinephrin works binding particular receptors
increase likelihood neurons will active. no alertness, no neuroplasticity.
However, alertness alone not sufficient. say, necessary not
sufficient neuroplasticity. know true also work Hubel Wiesel
looked brain plasticity response certain experiences subjects
either awake asleep. hate break cannot just simply
listen things sleep learn materials. Later talk can
certain things sleep unaware can enhance learning things
aware awake. not just listening
music listening tape sleep expecting sink in,
speak. Epinephrin released pay attention alert.

40:18 Acetylcholine Spotlight

important thing getting plasticity there'll epinephrin
equates alertness, plus release neuromodulator, acetylcholine. Now
acetylcholine released two sites brain. One also brainstem
named different things different animals, humans rich site
acetylcholine neurons neurons make acetylcholine parabigeminal nucleus
parabrachial region. number different names aggregates


neurons. don't need know names, need know
area brainstem area sends wires, axons area
brain filters sensory input. area brain called thalamus
getting bombarded sorts sensory input time. Costello snoring off
right, lights room, presence computer left,
coming in. pay attention something like really hone Costello
snoring, create cone attention cone attention reflects
acetylcholine now amplifying signal sounds Costello making
snoring essentially making signal greater signal around it,
call signal-to-noise goes up. engineering background will
familiar signal-to-noise. not engineering background,
don't worry it. means one particular shout crowd comes through,
Costello's snoring becomes salient, apparent relative everything else
going on. Acetylcholine acts spotlight epinephrin alertness. acetylcholine
spotlighting inputs. two things alone not enough get plasticity.
needs third component. third component acetylcholine released
area forebrain called nucleus basalis. really want get technical,
called nucleus basalis Meynert. buddying physicians
going medical school, know that.

42:26 Chemical Trio Massive Brain Change

acetylcholine released brainstem, acetylcholine released
nucleus basalis epinephrin, can change brain. can say
confidence Merzenich Recanzone well members
Merzenich lab, Michael Kilgard others incredible experiments
stimulated release acetylcholine nucleus basalis either electrode
methods talk about. found
stimulate three brain regions, locus coeruleus, brainstem source
acetylcholine basal forebrain source acetylcholine.
three things whatever happen listening to, paying attention
immediately one trial takes representation particular area brain.
essentially get rapid massive learning one shop. shown
variety papers also guy named Norman Weinberger


UC Irvine. now considered fundamental principle nervous
system works. Hubel Wiesel talked critical periods developmental
plasticity, clear work Merzenich Weinberg others,
get three things, can access three things epinephrin, acetylcholine
two sources, not will nervous system change, change.
absolutely will change. important thing people understand
want change brain. cannot just passively experience things
repetition can important, way use repetition change brain
fundamentally different. now talk translate

44:10 Ways Change Brain

scientific information history protocols can actually apply,
think many interested in. willing bet
not interested lowering electrodes nucleus basalis frankly,
neither I. episode one Huberman Lab Podcast, described various ways
people can monitor change nervous system. ways include brain
machine interface, pharmacology, behavioral practices, behavioral practices
course can include dos, don'ts, don't that, et cetera
thinking neuroplasticity, want frank conversation one
can also acknowledge untapped capacity just not hearing
there, one can also combine behavioral practices pharmacology. One can
combine behavioral practices brain machine interface, don't
that. fact, not recommending anything particular. always, say
again, not physician, don't prescribe anything. professor, profess
lot things. health medical care you.
responsible health wellbeing. not going tell
take. going describe literature tells us suggests ways
access plasticity. know need epinephrin, means alertness. people
accomplish cup coffee good night's sleep. will say

obvious one. get sleep handled. place,

46:16 Love, Hate, & Shame: chemical

question access alertness? Well, number ways.
people use pretty elaborate psychological gymnastics. will tell people
going something create accountability. really
good. post picture online commit learning
certain amount losing, excuse me, certain amount weight something like this.
can use either shame-based practices potentially embarrass
don't follow through. write cheques organizations hate insist
cash don't actually follow love, know,
decide going run marathon learn language something
somebody love want devote somebody. truth
standpoint epinephrin getting alert activated, doesn't really matter.
Epinephrin chemical brain not distinguish things
love hate, anger fear. really doesn't, promote autonomic arousal
release epinephrin. think people feeling not motivated
make changes key thing identify not just one

47:30 Dopamine Trap

probably kit reasons, several reasons want make
particular change drawn toward particular goal excited can
one, also motivated not completely afraid, ashamed, humiliated not
following goal another. just want briefly mention one little aside
got friend physician, cardiologist really
interesting theory. just theory, think will resonate lot people,
that, heard molecule dopamine gives us sense reward
accomplish something. Well, also want able access dopamine
working towards things, enjoy process say, 'cause sorts


positive effects gives us energy, et cetera. friend, says is, know,
many many instances someone will come say, "You know
what, going write book." says, "Oh, great. sure book's going
terrific really write book." never go it.
theory is, get much dopamine reward people saying, Oh yeah,
absolutely going able that, might not actually go reward
accomplishment itself. aware positive reinforcements also. not
saying people flagellate point victory whatever
pursuing, motivation tricky one. suggest everyone asks
want accomplish? driving accomplish
come two three things. Fear-based perhaps, love-based perhaps
perhaps several order ensure alertness, energy attention task.
brings us attention part. Now one thing electrode
embedded brain increase amount acetylcholine. another exist
real world outside laboratory trouble focusing. trouble
bringing attention particular location space particular event.
lot discussion nowadays smartphones devices creating sort attention
deficit, almost clinical level many people, including adults. think largely
true. means, however, responsible

49:40 Nicotine Focus

learning create depth focus. important Neuroscience
principles get depth focus. want briefly talk pharmacology first
always get asked this. People say, "What can take increase
levels acetylcholine?" Well, things can take. Nicotine called nicotine
acetylcholine binds nicotinic receptor. two kinds
acetylcholine receptors, muscarinic nicotinic, nicotinic ones involved
attention alertness. colleagues, not my, know kind like bro,
science buddies, friends too, Nobel prize winning colleague
chews Nicorette works. used smoker. quit smoking
fear lung cancer, seemed like smart choice, missed level focus
bring work. somebody long career. ever
meet him, unfortunately can't name him. ever meet realize


chews five pieces Nicorette hour, not suggesting people do.
asked him, "Why this?" said, "Well, increases alertness
focus." also theory want really underscore theory not
scientifically supported yet, offsets Parkinson's Alzheimer's. true
nucleus basalis primary site degeneration brain, people
dementia Parkinson's leads lot inability focus
attention, not just deficits plasticity. might onto something. Now tried
chewing Nicorette, makes super jittery. don't like can't focus well.
kind takes far level autonomic arousal. got friends dip
Nicorette day, scientists, writers artists musicians
familiar effects nicotine era lot people smoked
fortunately fewer people smoke now. interested pharmacology,
supplements things can increase cholinergic transmission brain.
not suggesting going go route, want
careful much rely time. essence plasticity
create window attention focus distinct rest day.
going create mark brain potential plasticity. Things
increase acetylcholine, besides nicotine Nicorette, nicotine come
variety sources things like alpha-GPC choline. number
things. encourage go examine.com, website just put
acetylcholine will give list supplements well dangers
supplements associated cholinergic transmission.
remiss lying didn't say lot people

52:30 Sprinting

using cholinergic drugs order increase level focus. since
coming Olympics, don't want get anyone trouble well aware
fact sprinters really cholinergic drugs not
acetylcholine important focus allows hear gun first
blocks sprints. lot race won, hearing gun
quickest reaction time. take cholinergic agents well
acetylcholine molecule controls nerve muscle contraction. speed
reflexes actually controlled nicotinic transmission well. lots think


terms acetylcholine sport mental acuity, not just plasticity. Now
you, probably don't want chew Nicorette, definitely don't want smoke cigarettes
take supplements increasing acetylcholine. ways can
increase acetylcholine? there, going sound like bit circular argument
increase focus.

53:30 Focus

increase focus? know, people familiar sitting down, reading
couple pages book realizing none sunk talking someone
seeing mouth move, maybe even nodding head subconsciously none
sinks in. can damaging school, work performance relationships
many know. Costello incidentally never seems pay attention anything say
looking directly me, contradicts say,
best way get better focusing use mechanisms focus born
with. key principle mental focus follows visual focus.
familiar fact visual system can unfocused, blurry jumping around
can laser focused one location space. interesting vitally
important understanding access neuroplasticity can use visual
focus can increase visual focus way increasing mental focus
abilities broadly. going explain that. Plasticity starts
alertness. mentioned before, alertness can come sense love,
sense joy, sense fear, doesn't matter. pharmacologic ways access

55:22 Adderall: Use & Abuse

increase epinephrin. Now, many people now also using Adderall. Adderall
chemically looks lot like amphetamine basically amphetamine. will increase
epinephrin release locus coeruleus, will wake brain lot


people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes
prescribed attention deficit. However, also high probability abuse
especially not prescribed it. Adderall will not increase focus,
increases alertness. not touch acetylcholine system.
taking Adderall say, "Well, really increases focus overall", probably
autonomic nervous system just veering towards call
parasympathetic. really just sleepy bringing levels
alertness up. mentioned, Adderall problematic number people
can habit forming. Learning Adderall not always translate high-

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog
bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused
anything. Think grazing animals, cows, sheep birds, et cetera.
think bird picking seeds beach concrete. bird's head

eyes, briefly move inward, called vergence eye movement. Now
eyes can't actually translocate head, fixed skull, just like
mine are. move eyes slightly inward, maybe can tell
like basically shortening making inter pupillary distance called smaller.
Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,
activate set neurons brainstem trigger release
norepinephrine, epinephrin acetylcholine. Norepinephrine kind similar
epinephrin. words, eyes relaxed head just
kind looking entire visual environment, moving head around, moving

particular visual target visual world shrinks, level visual focus goes


know relates release acetylcholine epinephrin relevant

focusing mind sake reading listening, need practice can
practice focusing visual system. Now works best practice focusing
visual system precise distance, work intend sake

something related to, don't know, science, reading science paper
hard time, not absorbing. might think looking paper
reading. looking screen, actually eyes probably darting
around bit. Experiments done this. gathering information
many sources visual environment. Now, presumably me, already

challenges focusing spending just 60 120 seconds focusing visual attention
small window screen, meaning just screen nothing it, bringing
eyes particular location increases not just visual acuity location
brings increase activity bunch brain areas associated
gathering information location. put simply, want improve
ability focus practice visual focus. Now, wear contacts wear corrective

off use blurry image. finer visual image can hold

1:02:59 Blinking

gaze visual image, higher levels attention will be. Many times
Instagram teased not blinking often. actually
practiced thing. blink get tired, hear probably just
say, duh. get tired, neurons brainstem responsible alertness
hold eyelids open start falter eyelids start close.
hard, words, "I barely keep eyes open" may feel right
now. assuming paying attention alert, alert,

course necessary lubricate eyes. People blink eyes might get dry.


can keep focused blinking less focusing eyes particular

1:05:30 Ear Toward Learning

listening auditory cue doesn't involve vision all? look people
learning things auditory system, will often close eyes.
not coincidence. somebody listening hard, please don't ask look
directly eye also asking listen you. actually one
worst ways get somebody listen you. say, now listen look

1:12:00 Ultra(dian) Focus

get epinephrin, alertness, get acetylcholine released
can focus attention. question long? earlier
podcast, talked ultradian cycles lasts 90 minutes. typical
learning 90 minutes. think learning will no doubt
include five 10 minutes warmup period. think everyone give

1:13:30 Real Change Occurs



Feel free blink, course, can greatly increase powers focus
rates learning anchored work Merzenich, Hubel Wiesel
others. Now trigger plasticity, real secret neuroplasticity
doesn't occur wakefulness. occurs sleep. now know focus
hard something 90 minutes so, maybe even several bouts
per day. can that, people can, people can one focus
learning, night following nights, asleep neural
circuits highlighted will acetylcholine transmission will strengthen
will lost, wonderful essence plasticity.
means eventually wake couple days week later,
will will acquired knowledge forever unless go process
actively unlearn it. will talk unlearning later episode. mastering
sleep key order reinforce learning occurs. say get really
poor night sleep learning. Chances are, sleep next night
following night learning will occur. stamp brain
acetylcholine released. actually marks synapses neurochemically
metabolically, synopses biased change. Now, don't
ever get deep sleep probably won't get changes. also way
can bypass need deep sleep least partially engaging
call Non Sleep Deep Rest, NSDR protocols. just want discuss signs
this. paper published Cell Reports last year shows
people did, spatial memory task, actually quite difficult one
remember sequence lights lighting just two three lights
particular sequence easy get 15 16 lights numbers
sequence actually gets quite challenging. immediately after, immediately
learning actual performance task, people took 20 minute Non Sleep
Deep Rest protocol took shallow nap, lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,
just closing eyes, no sensory input, rates learning significantly higher

can actually accelerate learning NSDR protocols brief naps, 90
minutes less. key plasticity childhood child.

1:16:20 Much Learning Enough?



key plasticity adulthood engage alertness, engage focus
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest deep sleep typical sleep.
always get asked, "How many bouts learning can perform?" Well, know people
train visual focus mechanisms point can several 90
minute bouts throughout day, many three four. also
inserting Non Sleep Deep Rest well. Now can get pretty tricky.

1:16:50 Learning (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift

lot people find can recover best intense bouts focused
learning motor activity get self-generated optic flow.
make sense ever heard lecture stress done
little bit various podcasts. mode self-generated optic flow like
walking running cycling things just floating past us retina, not

1:18:16 Synthesis/Summary

including Cell Reports paper mentioned moments ago. want
synthesize information covered now. entire month


neuroplasticity. Today's episode covered lot, no means
covered potential neuroplasticity protocols plasticity. will get
it. today want make sure key elements form backbone
neuroplasticity really embedded people's minds. First all, plasticity occurs
throughout lifespan. Early, birth 25, mere exposure sensory event can
create plasticity. good thing bad thing. going talk
unlearning bad stuff, traumas, et cetera subsequent episode month.
want learn adult, alert. might seem obvious think lot
people don't think 24 hour cycle, alert. four
episodes devoted 24-hour cycle cycles alertness sleep.
encourage listen haven't opportunity yet just ask
day typically tend alert? will afford
advantage learning specific things period time. don't give
period time things meaningless, useless, not aligned goals.
That'd terrible time get passive observance just letting time get
soaked away something. valuable asset, epinephrin, released
brainstem going occur readily particular phases 24-hour cycle
others, waking phase course. know are.
start think behavioral practices, maybe pharmacologic
practices like caffeine, hydration, et cetera will support heightened levels
alertness. Attention something can learned attention critical creating
condition whatever engaging will modify brain
way won't spend much attention going forward.
essence plasticity, things will eventually become reflexive. language
learning, motor movement, cognitive skill, ability suppress
emotional response engage emotional response depending goals
appropriate you. Increasing acetylcholine can accomplished
pharmacologically nicotine. However, certain dangers many people
well cost, financial cost, learning engage cholinergic

blinks need them, long can maintain visual focus target,
just piece paper set feet away room level computer

visual focus necessary. Now, way get high levels visual focus


alertness panic situation very, bad. will
immediately focused everything related situation, unfortunate.
really talking trying harness mechanisms attention get
better paying attention. may want auditory system, not
visual system, either low vision no vision,
trying learn something relates sounds see.
people trying learn information, cognitive information, trying learn
hear nuance partner's explanations emotionally challenging
events, et cetera. just remember, way, said earlier,
really want somebody listen really hear saying
underlying it, not, cannot expect look directly
that. actually going limit ability focus. trying rescue folks
might struggle. course never struggle.
supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus
entire period one 90-minute cycle. beginning end going little bit
flickering focus. know one 90-minute cycles
starting, typically wake os beginning first 90-minute cycle,


not minute. able tap sense 90-minute
cycles start engage learning practices choose.
course getting non sleep deep rest just deliberate disengagement,
walking running, just sitting, eyes closed eyes open kind mindlessly
might seem chair, just letting thoughts move around learning will
accelerate rate plasticity shown quality peer reviewed studies.
course, deep sleep. can start see plasticity
natural right early life. age 25 work order
access it. fortunately, beautiful experiments Hubel Wiesel
Merzenich Weinberger others point direction allows us achieve
plasticity,

1:25:15 Learning Repetition, Forming Habits

way epinephrin works binding particular receptors
increase likelihood neurons will active. no alertness, no neuroplasticity.
However, alertness alone not sufficient. say, necessary not

alertness. mentioned before, alertness can come sense love,
sense joy, sense fear, doesn't matter. pharmacologic ways access
alertness too. common one course caffeine watch sleep

drink plenty caffeine. heavy user caffeine. don't think abuser caffeine.
think reasonable amounts provided can still fall asleep night, caffeine can
relatively safe way

55:22 Adderall: Use & Abuse

increase epinephrin. Now, many people now also using Adderall. Adderall
chemically looks lot like amphetamine basically amphetamine. will increase
epinephrin release locus coeruleus, will wake brain lot


people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes
prescribed attention deficit. However, also high probability abuse
especially not prescribed it. Adderall will not increase focus,
increases alertness. not touch acetylcholine system.
taking Adderall say, "Well, really increases focus overall", probably
autonomic nervous system just veering towards call
parasympathetic. really just sleepy bringing levels
alertness up. mentioned, Adderall problematic number people
can habit forming. Learning Adderall not always translate high-
performance off Adderall later times. Adderall discussion broader
one perhaps psychiatrist room point
widely abused drug point time.

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog
bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused
anything. Think grazing animals, cows, sheep birds, et cetera.
think bird picking seeds beach concrete. bird's head
here. foot off ground, small bird six inches off
ground eyes side head yet tiny beak can
quickly pick little seeds off ground immense precision. Now, try
staring off sides room picking items front
high precision tiny scale, little tiny objects, will miss almost every time.
perfectly don't smash beak ground damage it,
beautiful movement acuity also. it? create
focus awareness front them? turns lower head,
eyes, briefly move inward, called vergence eye movement. Now
eyes can't actually translocate head, fixed skull, just like
mine are. move eyes slightly inward, maybe can tell
like basically shortening making inter pupillary distance called smaller.
Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,
activate set neurons brainstem trigger release
norepinephrine, epinephrin acetylcholine. Norepinephrine kind similar
epinephrin. words, eyes relaxed head just
kind looking entire visual environment, moving head around, moving
space optic flow, things moving past us sitting still,
looking broadly space, relaxed. eyes move slightly inward toward
particular visual target visual world shrinks, level visual focus goes


know relates release acetylcholine epinephrin relevant
sites brain plasticity. Now, means hard time
focusing mind sake reading listening, need practice can
practice focusing visual system. Now works best practice focusing
visual system precise distance, work intend sake
plasticity. look real world? say, trying concentrate
something related to, don't know, science, reading science paper
hard time, not absorbing. might think looking paper
reading. looking screen, actually eyes probably darting
around bit. Experiments done this. gathering information
many sources visual environment. Now, presumably me, already
coffee, hydrated. well rested, slept well. still experienced
challenges focusing spending just 60 120 seconds focusing visual attention
small window screen, meaning just screen nothing it, bringing
eyes particular location increases not just visual acuity location
brings increase activity bunch brain areas associated
gathering information location. put simply, want improve
ability focus practice visual focus. Now, wear contacts wear corrective
lenses, fine. course want use those. don't want take
off use blurry image. finer visual image can hold

1:02:59 Blinking

gaze visual image, higher levels attention will be. Many times
Instagram teased not blinking often. actually
practiced thing. blink get tired, hear probably just
say, duh. get tired, neurons brainstem responsible alertness
hold eyelids open start falter eyelids start close.
hard, words, "I barely keep eyes open" may feel right
now. assuming paying attention alert, alert,
eyes wide, eyes open. get tired, eyelids start close.
Blinks, actually reset perception time space. shown beautiful
paper Current Biology. sure post reference notes. blinking
course necessary lubricate eyes. People blink eyes might get dry.


can keep focused blinking less focusing eyes particular

can can maintain kind cone tunnel
mental focus. sort revealing practice worked hard
blinking contest 14-year-old niece still beats every time
really bothers me, also just self practice learning blink less
focus visual attention smaller region space. Now me, important
mainly learning things computer screen. going

entire discussion unto principle holds. need alertness.
can get mental tricks motivation, fear love, whatever is,
pharmacology, please healthfully. know, caffeine practice,

1:05:30 Ear Toward Learning

listening auditory cue doesn't involve vision all? look people
learning things auditory system, will often close eyes.
not coincidence. somebody listening hard, please don't ask look
directly eye also asking listen you. actually one
worst ways get somebody listen you. say, now listen look
eye. visual system will take see mouth move,
going hear thoughts going hear saying. Closing
eyes one best ways create cone auditory attention.
low vision no vision folks do. tremendous capacity focus attention

seeing things spelled us YouTube videos videos things move
dramatic. true look motion stimulate,
seeing movies things things dramatic intense,
worst getting attending things like text page listening
something like podcast extracting information much think many
people asked me, "Hey know what, aren't providing intense visuals

not exciting moment perhaps watching movie something
spoonfed us. attention can put something, even fleeting

1:12:00 Ultra(dian) Focus

get epinephrin, alertness, get acetylcholine released
can focus attention. question long? earlier
podcast, talked ultradian cycles lasts 90 minutes. typical
learning 90 minutes. think learning will no doubt
include five 10 minutes warmup period. think everyone give
permission not fully focused early part about. middle
middle hour able maintain focus

1:13:30 Real Change Occurs



Feel free blink, course, can greatly increase powers focus
rates learning anchored work Merzenich, Hubel Wiesel
others. Now trigger plasticity, real secret neuroplasticity
doesn't occur wakefulness. occurs sleep. now know focus
hard something 90 minutes so, maybe even several bouts
per day. can that, people can, people can one focus
learning, night following nights, asleep neural
circuits highlighted will acetylcholine transmission will strengthen
will lost, wonderful essence plasticity.
means eventually wake couple days week later,
will will acquired knowledge forever unless go process
actively unlearn it. will talk unlearning later episode. mastering
sleep key order reinforce learning occurs. say get really
poor night sleep learning. Chances are, sleep next night
following night learning will occur. stamp brain
acetylcholine released. actually marks synapses neurochemically
metabolically, synopses biased change. Now, don't
ever get deep sleep probably won't get changes. also way
can bypass need deep sleep least partially engaging
call Non Sleep Deep Rest, NSDR protocols. just want discuss signs
this. paper published Cell Reports last year shows
people did, spatial memory task, actually quite difficult one
remember sequence lights lighting just two three lights
particular sequence easy get 15 16 lights numbers
sequence actually gets quite challenging. immediately after, immediately
learning actual performance task, people took 20 minute Non Sleep
Deep Rest protocol took shallow nap, lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,
just closing eyes, no sensory input, rates learning significantly higher
information two just good night's sleep following night.
can actually accelerate learning NSDR protocols brief naps, 90
minutes less. key plasticity childhood child.

1:16:20 Much Learning Enough?



key plasticity adulthood engage alertness, engage focus
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest deep sleep typical sleep.
always get asked, "How many bouts learning can perform?" Well, know people
train visual focus mechanisms point can several 90
minute bouts throughout day, many three four. also
inserting Non Sleep Deep Rest well. Now can get pretty tricky.

1:16:50 Learning (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift

lot people find can recover best intense bouts focused
learning motor activity get self-generated optic flow.
make sense ever heard lecture stress done
little bit various podcasts. mode self-generated optic flow like
walking running cycling things just floating past us retina, not
really looking anywhere particular, opposite tight window focus.
that, areas brain like amygdala involved
releasing epinephrin create alertness. extremes, creates fear certainly

1:18:16 Synthesis/Summary

including Cell Reports paper mentioned moments ago. want
synthesize information covered now. entire month


neuroplasticity. Today's episode covered lot, no means
covered potential neuroplasticity protocols plasticity. will get
it. today want make sure key elements form backbone
neuroplasticity really embedded people's minds. First all, plasticity occurs
throughout lifespan. Early, birth 25, mere exposure sensory event can
create plasticity. good thing bad thing. going talk
unlearning bad stuff, traumas, et cetera subsequent episode month.
want learn adult, alert. might seem obvious think lot
people don't think 24 hour cycle, alert. four
episodes devoted 24-hour cycle cycles alertness sleep.
encourage listen haven't opportunity yet just ask
day typically tend alert? will afford
advantage learning specific things period time. don't give
period time things meaningless, useless, not aligned goals.
That'd terrible time get passive observance just letting time get
soaked away something. valuable asset, epinephrin, released
brainstem going occur readily particular phases 24-hour cycle
others, waking phase course. know are.
start think behavioral practices, maybe pharmacologic
practices like caffeine, hydration, et cetera will support heightened levels
alertness. Attention something can learned attention critical creating
condition whatever engaging will modify brain
way won't spend much attention going forward.
essence plasticity, things will eventually become reflexive. language
learning, motor movement, cognitive skill, ability suppress
emotional response engage emotional response depending goals
appropriate you. Increasing acetylcholine can accomplished
pharmacologically nicotine. However, certain dangers many people
well cost, financial cost, learning engage cholinergic

blinks need them, long can maintain visual focus target,
just piece paper set feet away room level computer

visual focus necessary. Now, way get high levels visual focus


alertness panic situation very, bad. will
immediately focused everything related situation, unfortunate.
really talking trying harness mechanisms attention get
better paying attention. may want auditory system, not
visual system, either low vision no vision,
trying learn something relates sounds see.
people trying learn information, cognitive information, trying learn
hear nuance partner's explanations emotionally challenging
events, et cetera. just remember, way, said earlier,
really want somebody listen really hear saying
underlying it, not, cannot expect look directly
that. actually going limit ability focus. trying rescue folks
might struggle. course never struggle.
supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus
entire period one 90-minute cycle. beginning end going little bit
flickering focus. know one 90-minute cycles
starting, typically wake os beginning first 90-minute cycle,


not minute. able tap sense 90-minute
cycles start engage learning practices choose.
course getting non sleep deep rest just deliberate disengagement,
walking running, just sitting, eyes closed eyes open kind mindlessly
might seem chair, just letting thoughts move around learning will
accelerate rate plasticity shown quality peer reviewed studies.
course, deep sleep. can start see plasticity
natural right early life. age 25 work order
access it. fortunately, beautiful experiments Hubel Wiesel
Merzenich Weinberger others point direction allows us achieve
plasticity,

1:25:15 Learning Repetition, Forming Habits

38:15 Adrenalin Alertness

highlight neural circuits stand chance changing. Now not necessarily

Epinephrin released region brainstem called locus coeruleus. Fancy
name, don't need know unless want to. Locus coeruleus sends
little wires call axons hoses entire brain essentially
neurochemical, epinephrin. Now not always hosing brain epinephrin.
high states alertness epinephrin released. way
circuit designed, nonspecific. essentially waking entire brain
way epinephrin works binding particular receptors
increase likelihood neurons will active. no alertness, no neuroplasticity.
However, alertness alone not sufficient. say, necessary not
sufficient neuroplasticity. know true also work Hubel Wiesel
looked brain plasticity response certain experiences subjects
either awake asleep. hate break cannot just simply
listen things sleep learn materials. Later talk can
certain things sleep unaware can enhance learning things
aware awake. not just listening

speak. Epinephrin released pay attention alert.

40:18 Acetylcholine Spotlight

important thing getting plasticity there'll epinephrin
equates alertness, plus release neuromodulator, acetylcholine. Now
acetylcholine released two sites brain. One also brainstem
named different things different animals, humans rich site
acetylcholine neurons neurons make acetylcholine parabigeminal nucleus
parabrachial region. number different names aggregates


neurons. don't need know names, need know
area brainstem area sends wires, axons area

snoring, create cone attention cone attention reflects
acetylcholine now amplifying signal sounds Costello making
snoring essentially making signal greater signal around it,
call signal-to-noise goes up. engineering background will
familiar signal-to-noise. not engineering background,
don't worry it. means one particular shout crowd comes through,
Costello's snoring becomes salient, apparent relative everything else
going on. Acetylcholine acts spotlight epinephrin alertness. acetylcholine
spotlighting inputs. two things alone not enough get plasticity.
needs third component. third component acetylcholine released
area forebrain called nucleus basalis. really want get technical,
called nucleus basalis Meynert. buddying physicians

44:10 Ways Change Brain

scientific information history protocols can actually apply,
think many interested in. willing bet
not interested lowering electrodes nucleus basalis frankly,
neither I. episode one Huberman Lab Podcast, described various ways
people can monitor change nervous system. ways include brain
machine interface, pharmacology, behavioral practices, behavioral practices

47:30 Dopamine Trap

probably kit reasons, several reasons want make

working towards things, enjoy process say, 'cause sorts


positive effects gives us energy, et cetera. friend, says is, know,
many many instances someone will come say, "You know
what, going write book." says, "Oh, great. sure book's going
terrific really write book." never go it.
theory is, get much dopamine reward people saying, Oh yeah,
absolutely going able that, might not actually go reward
accomplishment itself. aware positive reinforcements also. not

49:40 Nicotine Focus

learning create depth focus. important Neuroscience
principles get depth focus. want briefly talk pharmacology first
always get asked this. People say, "What can take increase

acetylcholine binds nicotinic receptor. two kinds
acetylcholine receptors, muscarinic nicotinic, nicotinic ones involved

terms acetylcholine sport mental acuity, not just plasticity. Now
you, probably don't want chew Nicorette, definitely don't want smoke cigarettes
take supplements increasing acetylcholine. ways can
increase acetylcholine? there, going sound like bit circular argument
increase focus.

53:30 Focus

increase focus? know, people familiar sitting down, reading
couple pages book realizing none sunk talking someone
seeing mouth move, maybe even nodding head subconsciously none
sinks in. can damaging school, work performance relationships
many know. Costello incidentally never seems pay attention anything say
looking directly me, contradicts say,

1:16:20 Much Learning Enough?



key plasticity adulthood engage alertness, engage focus
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest deep sleep typical sleep.
always get asked, "How many bouts learning can perform?" Well, know people
train visual focus mechanisms point can several 90

including Cell Reports paper mentioned moments ago. want
synthesize information covered now. entire month


neuroplasticity. Today's episode covered lot, no means
covered potential neuroplasticity protocols plasticity. will get
it. today want make sure key elements form backbone
neuroplasticity really embedded people's minds. First all, plasticity occurs
throughout lifespan. Early, birth 25, mere exposure sensory event can
create plasticity. good thing bad thing. going talk
unlearning bad stuff, traumas, et cetera subsequent episode month.
want learn adult, alert. might seem obvious think lot
people don't think 24 hour cycle, alert. four
episodes devoted 24-hour cycle cycles alertness sleep.
encourage listen haven't opportunity yet just ask
day typically tend alert? will afford
advantage learning specific things period time. don't give
period time things meaningless, useless, not aligned goals.
That'd terrible time get passive observance just letting time get
soaked away something. valuable asset, epinephrin, released

others, waking phase course. know are.
start think behavioral practices, maybe pharmacologic
practices like caffeine, hydration, et cetera will support heightened levels
alertness. Attention something can learned attention critical creating
condition whatever engaging will modify brain
way won't spend much attention going forward.
essence plasticity, things will eventually become reflexive. language

that. actually going limit ability focus. trying rescue folks
might struggle. course never struggle.
supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus
entire period one 90-minute cycle. beginning end going little bit
flickering focus. know one 90-minute cycles
starting, typically wake os beginning first 90-minute cycle,


not minute. able tap sense 90-minute
cycles start engage learning practices choose.
course getting non sleep deep rest just deliberate disengagement,
walking running, just sitting, eyes closed eyes open kind mindlessly
might seem chair, just letting thoughts move around learning will
accelerate rate plasticity shown quality peer reviewed studies.
course, deep sleep. can start see plasticity
natural right early life. age 25 work order

high states alertness epinephrin released. way
circuit designed, nonspecific. essentially waking entire brain
way epinephrin works binding particular receptors
increase likelihood neurons will active. no alertness, no neuroplasticity.
However, alertness alone not sufficient. say, necessary not

40:18 Acetylcholine Spotlight

important thing getting plasticity there'll epinephrin
equates alertness, plus release neuromodulator, acetylcholine. Now
acetylcholine released two sites brain. One also brainstem
named different things different animals, humans rich site
acetylcholine neurons neurons make acetylcholine parabigeminal nucleus

snoring, create cone attention cone attention reflects
acetylcholine now amplifying signal sounds Costello making
snoring essentially making signal greater signal around it,
call signal-to-noise goes up. engineering background will
familiar signal-to-noise. not engineering background,
don't worry it. means one particular shout crowd comes through,
Costello's snoring becomes salient, apparent relative everything else
going on. Acetylcholine acts spotlight epinephrin alertness. acetylcholine

increase focus.

53:30 Focus

increase focus? know, people familiar sitting down, reading

eyes can't actually translocate head, fixed skull, just like
mine are. move eyes slightly inward, maybe can tell
like basically shortening making inter pupillary distance called smaller.
Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,
activate set neurons brainstem trigger release

focusing mind sake reading listening, need practice can
practice focusing visual system. Now works best practice focusing
visual system precise distance, work intend sake
plasticity. look real world? say, trying concentrate
something related to, don't know, science, reading science paper
hard time, not absorbing. might think looking paper
reading. looking screen, actually eyes probably darting
around bit. Experiments done this. gathering information
many sources visual environment. Now, presumably me, already
coffee, hydrated. well rested, slept well. still experienced
challenges focusing spending just 60 120 seconds focusing visual attention
small window screen, meaning just screen nothing it, bringing
eyes particular location increases not just visual acuity location
brings increase activity bunch brain areas associated
gathering information location. put simply, want improve
ability focus practice visual focus. Now, wear contacts wear corrective
lenses, fine. course want use those. don't want take
off use blurry image. finer visual image can hold

1:02:59 Blinking

gaze visual image, higher levels attention will be. Many times
Instagram teased not blinking often. actually
practiced thing. blink get tired, hear probably just
say, duh. get tired, neurons brainstem responsible alertness
hold eyelids open start falter eyelids start close.
hard, words, "I barely keep eyes open" may feel right
now. assuming paying attention alert, alert,
eyes wide, eyes open. get tired, eyelids start close.
Blinks, actually reset perception time space. shown beautiful

course necessary lubricate eyes. People blink eyes might get dry.


can keep focused blinking less focusing eyes particular

can can maintain kind cone tunnel
mental focus. sort revealing practice worked hard
blinking contest 14-year-old niece still beats every time
really bothers me, also just self practice learning blink less
focus visual attention smaller region space. Now me, important
mainly learning things computer screen. going

entire discussion unto principle holds. need alertness.
can get mental tricks motivation, fear love, whatever is,
pharmacology, please healthfully. know, caffeine practice,

1:05:30 Ear Toward Learning

listening auditory cue doesn't involve vision all? look people
learning things auditory system, will often close eyes.
not coincidence. somebody listening hard, please don't ask look
directly eye also asking listen you. actually one
worst ways get somebody listen you. say, now listen look
eye. visual system will take see mouth move,
going hear thoughts going hear saying. Closing
eyes one best ways create cone auditory attention.
low vision no vision folks do. tremendous capacity focus attention

easy anchor attention phone following reason. First all,
restricted size. easy limit visual attention something
big. one design features phone. other, just
probably heard picture worth thousand words, well, movie worth 10,000

system will naturally gravitate towards them, towards movies. actually much
harder read words page used many people, used
seeing things spelled us YouTube videos videos things move
dramatic. true look motion stimulate,
seeing movies things things dramatic intense,
worst getting attending things like text page listening
something like podcast extracting information much think many
people asked me, "Hey know what, aren't providing intense visuals
us look at?" Well, frankly, lot people consuming content
pure auditory, through, listening. want able digest
material. addition that, think areas life dictate
whether not become successful, independent, healthy individuals,
involve kind boring practices digesting information page. Boring
not exciting moment perhaps watching movie something
spoonfed us. attention can put something, even fleeting
feel like getting little bits pieces, shards information

cholinergic system plasticity does, instance, watching movie.
watch movie, entire thing can great, can awesome.
can overriding experience think experiences,
somebody interested building brain expanding brain getting

1:12:00 Ultra(dian) Focus

get epinephrin, alertness, get acetylcholine released
can focus attention. question long? earlier
podcast, talked ultradian cycles lasts 90 minutes. typical
learning 90 minutes. think learning will no doubt
include five 10 minutes warmup period. think everyone give
permission not fully focused early part about. middle
middle hour able maintain focus
hour so. means eliminating distractions. means turning off wifi.
put phone room. find reflexively getting get phone

want try literally maintain visual focus thing trying learn.

1:13:30 Real Change Occurs



Feel free blink, course, can greatly increase powers focus
rates learning anchored work Merzenich, Hubel Wiesel
others. Now trigger plasticity, real secret neuroplasticity
doesn't occur wakefulness. occurs sleep. now know focus
hard something 90 minutes so, maybe even several bouts
per day. can that, people can, people can one focus
learning, night following nights, asleep neural
circuits highlighted will acetylcholine transmission will strengthen
will lost, wonderful essence plasticity.
means eventually wake couple days week later,
will will acquired knowledge forever unless go process
actively unlearn it. will talk unlearning later episode. mastering
sleep key order reinforce learning occurs. say get really
poor night sleep learning. Chances are, sleep next night
following night learning will occur. stamp brain
acetylcholine released. actually marks synapses neurochemically
metabolically, synopses biased change. Now, don't
ever get deep sleep probably won't get changes. also way
can bypass need deep sleep least partially engaging
call Non Sleep Deep Rest, NSDR protocols. just want discuss signs
this. paper published Cell Reports last year shows
people did, spatial memory task, actually quite difficult one
remember sequence lights lighting just two three lights
particular sequence easy get 15 16 lights numbers
sequence actually gets quite challenging. immediately after, immediately
learning actual performance task, people took 20 minute Non Sleep
Deep Rest protocol took shallow nap, lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,
just closing eyes, no sensory input, rates learning significantly higher
information two just good night's sleep following night.
can actually accelerate learning NSDR protocols brief naps, 90
minutes less. key plasticity childhood child.

1:16:20 Much Learning Enough?



key plasticity adulthood engage alertness, engage focus
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest deep sleep typical sleep.
always get asked, "How many bouts learning can perform?" Well, know people
train visual focus mechanisms point can several 90
minute bouts throughout day, many three four. also
inserting Non Sleep Deep Rest well. Now can get pretty tricky.

1:16:50 Learning (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift

lot people find can recover best intense bouts focused
learning motor activity get self-generated optic flow.
make sense ever heard lecture stress done
little bit various podcasts. mode self-generated optic flow like
walking running cycling things just floating past us retina, not
really looking anywhere particular, opposite tight window focus.
that, areas brain like amygdala involved
releasing epinephrin create alertness. extremes, creates fear certainly
alertness, shut down. form non sleep deep rest.
people find much pleasurable practical engage focused
learning go activity involves essentially call
worldlessness not really thinking much anything.
listen audio books podcasts run may want consider
whether not want spend time right now. love
listening podcast run cycle, much interested
actually getting benefits neuroplasticity just listening sake
listening me. many people letting mind drift not organized

learning depth learning. good scientific data support sorts
things,

1:18:16 Synthesis/Summary

including Cell Reports paper mentioned moments ago. want
synthesize information covered now. entire month


neuroplasticity. Today's episode covered lot, no means
covered potential neuroplasticity protocols plasticity. will get
it. today want make sure key elements form backbone
neuroplasticity really embedded people's minds. First all, plasticity occurs
throughout lifespan. Early, birth 25, mere exposure sensory event can
create plasticity. good thing bad thing. going talk
unlearning bad stuff, traumas, et cetera subsequent episode month.
want learn adult, alert. might seem obvious think lot
people don't think 24 hour cycle, alert. four
episodes devoted 24-hour cycle cycles alertness sleep.
encourage listen haven't opportunity yet just ask
day typically tend alert? will afford
advantage learning specific things period time. don't give
period time things meaningless, useless, not aligned goals.
That'd terrible time get passive observance just letting time get
soaked away something. valuable asset, epinephrin, released
brainstem going occur readily particular phases 24-hour cycle
others, waking phase course. know are.
start think behavioral practices, maybe pharmacologic
practices like caffeine, hydration, et cetera will support heightened levels
alertness. Attention something can learned attention critical creating
condition whatever engaging will modify brain
way won't spend much attention going forward.
essence plasticity, things will eventually become reflexive. language
learning, motor movement, cognitive skill, ability suppress
emotional response engage emotional response depending goals
appropriate you. Increasing acetylcholine can accomplished
pharmacologically nicotine. However, certain dangers many people
well cost, financial cost, learning engage cholinergic
system use visual system, practicing long can maintain focus
blinks need them, long can maintain visual focus target,
just piece paper set feet away room level computer
screen. actually things people communities high levels
visual focus necessary. Now, way get high levels visual focus


alertness panic situation very, bad. will
immediately focused everything related situation, unfortunate.
really talking trying harness mechanisms attention get
better paying attention. may want auditory system, not
visual system, either low vision no vision,
trying learn something relates sounds see.
people trying learn information, cognitive information, trying learn
hear nuance partner's explanations emotionally challenging
events, et cetera. just remember, way, said earlier,
really want somebody listen really hear saying
underlying it, not, cannot expect look directly
that. actually going limit ability focus. trying rescue folks
might struggle. course never struggle.
supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus
entire period one 90-minute cycle. beginning end going little bit
flickering focus. know one 90-minute cycles
starting, typically wake os beginning first 90-minute cycle,


not minute. able tap sense 90-minute
cycles start engage learning practices choose.
course getting non sleep deep rest just deliberate disengagement,
walking running, just sitting, eyes closed eyes open kind mindlessly
might seem chair, just letting thoughts move around learning will
accelerate rate plasticity shown quality peer reviewed studies.
course, deep sleep. can start see plasticity
natural right early life. age 25 work order
access it. fortunately, beautiful experiments Hubel Wiesel
Merzenich Weinberger others point direction allows us achieve
plasticity,

1:25:15 Learning Repetition, Forming Habits

points neurochemicals circuits. now behavioral protocols
allow us that. also really want emphasize entire
aspect behavioral practices will allow us engage plasticity don't involve
intense focus emotionality involve lot repetition. another entire
category plasticity involves seemed like almost mundane things
repeatedly incorporating reward system
involves dopamine. today talked kind plasticity comes
extreme focus. get extreme focus alertness naturally
harder, difficult event didn't want. kind stinger brain

hot stove engaging really horrible person. can get incredible plasticity
positive experiences things want engaging high focus regime
rest, non sleep deep rest, sleep. another aspect plasticity
will explore next episode well explore movement-based practices
enhancing plasticity plasticity movement itself. not high
attention kind high emotionality intensity experiences described
today. repetition reward repeat, repetition, reward,
repeat, used distinctly different category behavioral change
relate habits opposed learning particular types information allow

44:10 Ways Change Brain

scientific information history protocols can actually apply,
think many interested in. willing bet
not interested lowering electrodes nucleus basalis frankly,

47:30 Dopamine Trap

probably kit reasons, several reasons want make
particular change drawn toward particular goal excited can
one, also motivated not completely afraid, ashamed, humiliated not
following goal another. just want briefly mention one little aside
got friend physician, cardiologist really
interesting theory. just theory, think will resonate lot people,
that, heard molecule dopamine gives us sense reward
accomplish something. Well, also want able access dopamine
working towards things, enjoy process say, 'cause sorts


positive effects gives us energy, et cetera. friend, says is, know,
many many instances someone will come say, "You know
what, going write book." says, "Oh, great. sure book's going
terrific really write book." never go it.
theory is, get much dopamine reward people saying, Oh yeah,
absolutely going able that, might not actually go reward
accomplishment itself. aware positive reinforcements also. not
saying people flagellate point victory whatever

true. means, however, responsible

49:40 Nicotine Focus

learning create depth focus. important Neuroscience
principles get depth focus. want briefly talk pharmacology first
always get asked this. People say, "What can take increase
levels acetylcholine?" Well, things can take. Nicotine called nicotine
acetylcholine binds nicotinic receptor. two kinds
acetylcholine receptors, muscarinic nicotinic, nicotinic ones involved
attention alertness. colleagues, not my, know kind like bro,
science buddies, friends too, Nobel prize winning colleague
chews Nicorette works. used smoker. quit smoking

supplements associated cholinergic transmission.
remiss lying didn't say lot people

52:30 Sprinting

using cholinergic drugs order increase level focus. since
coming Olympics, don't want get anyone trouble well aware
fact sprinters really cholinergic drugs not
acetylcholine important focus allows hear gun first
blocks sprints. lot race won, hearing gun
quickest reaction time. take cholinergic agents well
acetylcholine molecule controls nerve muscle contraction. speed
reflexes actually controlled nicotinic transmission well. lots think


terms acetylcholine sport mental acuity, not just plasticity. Now
you, probably don't want chew Nicorette, definitely don't want smoke cigarettes
take supplements increasing acetylcholine. ways can
increase acetylcholine? there, going sound like bit circular argument
increase focus.

53:30 Focus

increase focus? know, people familiar sitting down, reading
couple pages book realizing none sunk talking someone
seeing mouth move, maybe even nodding head subconsciously none
sinks in. can damaging school, work performance relationships
many know. Costello incidentally never seems pay attention anything say
looking directly me, contradicts say,
best way get better focusing use mechanisms focus born
with. key principle mental focus follows visual focus.
familiar fact visual system can unfocused, blurry jumping around
can laser focused one location space. interesting vitally
important understanding access neuroplasticity can use visual
focus can increase visual focus way increasing mental focus
abilities broadly. going explain that. Plasticity starts
alertness. mentioned before, alertness can come sense love,
sense joy, sense fear, doesn't matter. pharmacologic ways access
alertness too. common one course caffeine watch sleep
episodes, know reduces molecule makes us sleepy called adenosine.
drink plenty caffeine. heavy user caffeine. don't think abuser caffeine.
think reasonable amounts provided can still fall asleep night, caffeine can
relatively safe way

55:22 Adderall: Use & Abuse

increase epinephrin. Now, many people now also using Adderall. Adderall
chemically looks lot like amphetamine basically amphetamine. will increase
epinephrin release locus coeruleus, will wake brain lot


people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes
prescribed attention deficit. However, also high probability abuse
especially not prescribed it. Adderall will not increase focus,
increases alertness. not touch acetylcholine system.
taking Adderall say, "Well, really increases focus overall", probably
autonomic nervous system just veering towards call
parasympathetic. really just sleepy bringing levels
alertness up. mentioned, Adderall problematic number people
can habit forming. Learning Adderall not always translate high-
performance off Adderall later times. Adderall discussion broader
one perhaps psychiatrist room point
widely abused drug point time.

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog
bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused
anything. Think grazing animals, cows, sheep birds, et cetera.
think bird picking seeds beach concrete. bird's head
here. foot off ground, small bird six inches off
ground eyes side head yet tiny beak can
quickly pick little seeds off ground immense precision. Now, try
staring off sides room picking items front
high precision tiny scale, little tiny objects, will miss almost every time.
perfectly don't smash beak ground damage it,
beautiful movement acuity also. it? create
focus awareness front them? turns lower head,
eyes, briefly move inward, called vergence eye movement. Now
eyes can't actually translocate head, fixed skull, just like
mine are. move eyes slightly inward, maybe can tell
like basically shortening making inter pupillary distance called smaller.
Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,
activate set neurons brainstem trigger release
norepinephrine, epinephrin acetylcholine. Norepinephrine kind similar
epinephrin. words, eyes relaxed head just
kind looking entire visual environment, moving head around, moving
space optic flow, things moving past us sitting still,
looking broadly space, relaxed. eyes move slightly inward toward
particular visual target visual world shrinks, level visual focus goes


know relates release acetylcholine epinephrin relevant
sites brain plasticity. Now, means hard time
focusing mind sake reading listening, need practice can
practice focusing visual system. Now works best practice focusing
visual system precise distance, work intend sake
plasticity. look real world? say, trying concentrate
something related to, don't know, science, reading science paper
hard time, not absorbing. might think looking paper
reading. looking screen, actually eyes probably darting
around bit. Experiments done this. gathering information
many sources visual environment. Now, presumably me, already
coffee, hydrated. well rested, slept well. still experienced
challenges focusing spending just 60 120 seconds focusing visual attention
small window screen, meaning just screen nothing it, bringing
eyes particular location increases not just visual acuity location
brings increase activity bunch brain areas associated
gathering information location. put simply, want improve
ability focus practice visual focus. Now, wear contacts wear corrective
lenses, fine. course want use those. don't want take
off use blurry image. finer visual image can hold

1:02:59 Blinking

gaze visual image, higher levels attention will be. Many times
Instagram teased not blinking often. actually
practiced thing. blink get tired, hear probably just
say, duh. get tired, neurons brainstem responsible alertness
hold eyelids open start falter eyelids start close.
hard, words, "I barely keep eyes open" may feel right
now. assuming paying attention alert, alert,
eyes wide, eyes open. get tired, eyelids start close.
Blinks, actually reset perception time space. shown beautiful
paper Current Biology. sure post reference notes. blinking
course necessary lubricate eyes. People blink eyes might get dry.


can keep focused blinking less focusing eyes particular
location probably pretty creepy experience this.
can can maintain kind cone tunnel
mental focus. sort revealing practice worked hard
blinking contest 14-year-old niece still beats every time
really bothers me, also just self practice learning blink less
focus visual attention smaller region space. Now me, important
mainly learning things computer screen. going
sport, quite bit different can discuss might translate sport.
fact, next episode, going talk plasticity focus

entire discussion unto principle holds. need alertness.
can get mental tricks motivation, fear love, whatever is,
pharmacology, please healthfully. know, caffeine practice,
certainly want well hydrated increases actually will increase alertness. Well,
full bladder will increase alertness although don't want alertness
high can think fact go urinate 'cause
distracting. don't want alertness go roof. need

neurochemicals. Now may ask, well, experiment people
feeling rotating drum

1:05:30 Ear Toward Learning

listening auditory cue doesn't involve vision all? look people

harder read words page used many people, used
seeing things spelled us YouTube videos videos things move
dramatic. true look motion stimulate,
seeing movies things things dramatic intense,
worst getting attending things like text page listening
something like podcast extracting information much think many
people asked me, "Hey know what, aren't providing intense visuals
us look at?" Well, frankly, lot people consuming content
pure auditory, through, listening. want able digest

1:12:00 Ultra(dian) Focus

get epinephrin, alertness, get acetylcholine released
can focus attention. question long? earlier
podcast, talked ultradian cycles lasts 90 minutes. typical
learning 90 minutes. think learning will no doubt
include five 10 minutes warmup period. think everyone give
permission not fully focused early part about. middle
middle hour able maintain focus
hour so. means eliminating distractions. means turning off wifi.
put phone room. find reflexively getting get phone

1:13:30 Real Change Occurs



Feel free blink, course, can greatly increase powers focus
rates learning anchored work Merzenich, Hubel Wiesel
others. Now trigger plasticity, real secret neuroplasticity
doesn't occur wakefulness. occurs sleep. now know focus
hard something 90 minutes so, maybe even several bouts
per day. can that, people can, people can one focus
learning, night following nights, asleep neural
circuits highlighted will acetylcholine transmission will strengthen
will lost, wonderful essence plasticity.
means eventually wake couple days week later,
will will acquired knowledge forever unless go process
actively unlearn it. will talk unlearning later episode. mastering
sleep key order reinforce learning occurs. say get really
poor night sleep learning. Chances are, sleep next night
following night learning will occur. stamp brain
acetylcholine released. actually marks synapses neurochemically
metabolically, synopses biased change. Now, don't
ever get deep sleep probably won't get changes. also way
can bypass need deep sleep least partially engaging
call Non Sleep Deep Rest, NSDR protocols. just want discuss signs
this. paper published Cell Reports last year shows
people did, spatial memory task, actually quite difficult one
remember sequence lights lighting just two three lights
particular sequence easy get 15 16 lights numbers
sequence actually gets quite challenging. immediately after, immediately
learning actual performance task, people took 20 minute Non Sleep
Deep Rest protocol took shallow nap, lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,
just closing eyes, no sensory input, rates learning significantly higher
information two just good night's sleep following night.
can actually accelerate learning NSDR protocols brief naps, 90
minutes less. key plasticity childhood child.

1:16:20 Much Learning Enough?



key plasticity adulthood engage alertness, engage focus
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest deep sleep typical sleep.
always get asked, "How many bouts learning can perform?" Well, know people
train visual focus mechanisms point can several 90
minute bouts throughout day, many three four. also
inserting Non Sleep Deep Rest well. Now can get pretty tricky.

1:16:50 Learning (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift

lot people find can recover best intense bouts focused
learning motor activity get self-generated optic flow.
make sense ever heard lecture stress done
little bit various podcasts. mode self-generated optic flow like
walking running cycling things just floating past us retina, not
really looking anywhere particular, opposite tight window focus.
that, areas brain like amygdala involved
releasing epinephrin create alertness. extremes, creates fear certainly

1:18:16 Synthesis/Summary

including Cell Reports paper mentioned moments ago. want
synthesize information covered now. entire month


neuroplasticity. Today's episode covered lot, no means
covered potential neuroplasticity protocols plasticity. will get
it. today want make sure key elements form backbone
neuroplasticity really embedded people's minds. First all, plasticity occurs
throughout lifespan. Early, birth 25, mere exposure sensory event can
create plasticity. good thing bad thing. going talk
unlearning bad stuff, traumas, et cetera subsequent episode month.
want learn adult, alert. might seem obvious think lot
people don't think 24 hour cycle, alert. four
episodes devoted 24-hour cycle cycles alertness sleep.
encourage listen haven't opportunity yet just ask
day typically tend alert? will afford
advantage learning specific things period time. don't give
period time things meaningless, useless, not aligned goals.
That'd terrible time get passive observance just letting time get
soaked away something. valuable asset, epinephrin, released
brainstem going occur readily particular phases 24-hour cycle
others, waking phase course. know are.
start think behavioral practices, maybe pharmacologic
practices like caffeine, hydration, et cetera will support heightened levels
alertness. Attention something can learned attention critical creating
condition whatever engaging will modify brain
way won't spend much attention going forward.
essence plasticity, things will eventually become reflexive. language
learning, motor movement, cognitive skill, ability suppress
emotional response engage emotional response depending goals
appropriate you. Increasing acetylcholine can accomplished
pharmacologically nicotine. However, certain dangers many people
well cost, financial cost, learning engage cholinergic

blinks need them, long can maintain visual focus target,
just piece paper set feet away room level computer

visual focus necessary. Now, way get high levels visual focus


alertness panic situation very, bad. will
immediately focused everything related situation, unfortunate.
really talking trying harness mechanisms attention get
better paying attention. may want auditory system, not
visual system, either low vision no vision,
trying learn something relates sounds see.
people trying learn information, cognitive information, trying learn
hear nuance partner's explanations emotionally challenging

really want somebody listen really hear saying
underlying it, not, cannot expect look directly
that. actually going limit ability focus. trying rescue folks
might struggle. course never struggle.
supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus
entire period one 90-minute cycle. beginning end going little bit
flickering focus. know one 90-minute cycles
starting, typically wake os beginning first 90-minute cycle,


not minute. able tap sense 90-minute
cycles start engage learning practices choose.
course getting non sleep deep rest just deliberate disengagement,
walking running, just sitting, eyes closed eyes open kind mindlessly
might seem chair, just letting thoughts move around learning will
accelerate rate plasticity shown quality peer reviewed studies.
course, deep sleep. can start see plasticity

49:40 Nicotine Focus

learning create depth focus. important Neuroscience
principles get depth focus. want briefly talk pharmacology first
always get asked this. People say, "What can take increase

terms acetylcholine sport mental acuity, not just plasticity. Now
you, probably don't want chew Nicorette, definitely don't want smoke cigarettes
take supplements increasing acetylcholine. ways can
increase acetylcholine? there, going sound like bit circular argument
increase focus.

53:30 Focus

increase focus? know, people familiar sitting down, reading
couple pages book realizing none sunk talking someone
seeing mouth move, maybe even nodding head subconsciously none
sinks in. can damaging school, work performance relationships
many know. Costello incidentally never seems pay attention anything say
looking directly me, contradicts say,
best way get better focusing use mechanisms focus born
with. key principle mental focus follows visual focus.
familiar fact visual system can unfocused, blurry jumping around
can laser focused one location space. interesting vitally
important understanding access neuroplasticity can use visual
focus can increase visual focus way increasing mental focus
abilities broadly. going explain that. Plasticity starts
alertness. mentioned before, alertness can come sense love,
sense joy, sense fear, doesn't matter. pharmacologic ways access
alertness too. common one course caffeine watch sleep
episodes, know reduces molecule makes us sleepy called adenosine.
drink plenty caffeine. heavy user caffeine. don't think abuser caffeine.
think reasonable amounts provided can still fall asleep night, caffeine can
relatively safe way

55:22 Adderall: Use & Abuse

increase epinephrin. Now, many people now also using Adderall. Adderall
chemically looks lot like amphetamine basically amphetamine. will increase
epinephrin release locus coeruleus, will wake brain lot


people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes
prescribed attention deficit. However, also high probability abuse
especially not prescribed it. Adderall will not increase focus,
increases alertness. not touch acetylcholine system.
taking Adderall say, "Well, really increases focus overall", probably
autonomic nervous system just veering towards call
parasympathetic. really just sleepy bringing levels
alertness up. mentioned, Adderall problematic number people
can habit forming. Learning Adderall not always translate high-
performance off Adderall later times. Adderall discussion broader
one perhaps psychiatrist room point
widely abused drug point time.

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog
bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused
anything. Think grazing animals, cows, sheep birds, et cetera.
think bird picking seeds beach concrete. bird's head
here. foot off ground, small bird six inches off
ground eyes side head yet tiny beak can
quickly pick little seeds off ground immense precision. Now, try
staring off sides room picking items front
high precision tiny scale, little tiny objects, will miss almost every time.
perfectly don't smash beak ground damage it,
beautiful movement acuity also. it? create
focus awareness front them? turns lower head,
eyes, briefly move inward, called vergence eye movement. Now
eyes can't actually translocate head, fixed skull, just like
mine are. move eyes slightly inward, maybe can tell
like basically shortening making inter pupillary distance called smaller.
Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,
activate set neurons brainstem trigger release
norepinephrine, epinephrin acetylcholine. Norepinephrine kind similar
epinephrin. words, eyes relaxed head just
kind looking entire visual environment, moving head around, moving
space optic flow, things moving past us sitting still,
looking broadly space, relaxed. eyes move slightly inward toward
particular visual target visual world shrinks, level visual focus goes


know relates release acetylcholine epinephrin relevant
sites brain plasticity. Now, means hard time
focusing mind sake reading listening, need practice can
practice focusing visual system. Now works best practice focusing
visual system precise distance, work intend sake
plasticity. look real world? say, trying concentrate
something related to, don't know, science, reading science paper
hard time, not absorbing. might think looking paper
reading. looking screen, actually eyes probably darting
around bit. Experiments done this. gathering information
many sources visual environment. Now, presumably me, already
coffee, hydrated. well rested, slept well. still experienced
challenges focusing spending just 60 120 seconds focusing visual attention
small window screen, meaning just screen nothing it, bringing
eyes particular location increases not just visual acuity location
brings increase activity bunch brain areas associated
gathering information location. put simply, want improve
ability focus practice visual focus. Now, wear contacts wear corrective
lenses, fine. course want use those. don't want take
off use blurry image. finer visual image can hold

1:02:59 Blinking

gaze visual image, higher levels attention will be. Many times
Instagram teased not blinking often. actually
practiced thing. blink get tired, hear probably just
say, duh. get tired, neurons brainstem responsible alertness
hold eyelids open start falter eyelids start close.
hard, words, "I barely keep eyes open" may feel right
now. assuming paying attention alert, alert,
eyes wide, eyes open. get tired, eyelids start close.
Blinks, actually reset perception time space. shown beautiful
paper Current Biology. sure post reference notes. blinking
course necessary lubricate eyes. People blink eyes might get dry.


can keep focused blinking less focusing eyes particular

can can maintain kind cone tunnel
mental focus. sort revealing practice worked hard
blinking contest 14-year-old niece still beats every time
really bothers me, also just self practice learning blink less
focus visual attention smaller region space. Now me, important
mainly learning things computer screen. going
sport, quite bit different can discuss might translate sport.
fact, next episode, going talk plasticity focus
mechanisms relate learning movement practices coordinated movements.
entire discussion unto principle holds. need alertness.
can get mental tricks motivation, fear love, whatever is,
pharmacology, please healthfully. know, caffeine practice,
certainly want well hydrated increases actually will increase alertness. Well,
full bladder will increase alertness although don't want alertness

1:05:30 Ear Toward Learning

listening auditory cue doesn't involve vision all? look people
learning things auditory system, will often close eyes.
not coincidence. somebody listening hard, please don't ask look

principles get depth focus. want briefly talk pharmacology first
always get asked this. People say, "What can take increase

terms acetylcholine sport mental acuity, not just plasticity. Now
you, probably don't want chew Nicorette, definitely don't want smoke cigarettes
take supplements increasing acetylcholine. ways can
increase acetylcholine? there, going sound like bit circular argument
increase focus.

53:30 Focus

increase focus? know, people familiar sitting down, reading
couple pages book realizing none sunk talking someone
seeing mouth move, maybe even nodding head subconsciously none
sinks in. can damaging school, work performance relationships
many know. Costello incidentally never seems pay attention anything say
looking directly me, contradicts say,
best way get better focusing use mechanisms focus born
with. key principle mental focus follows visual focus.
familiar fact visual system can unfocused, blurry jumping around
can laser focused one location space. interesting vitally
important understanding access neuroplasticity can use visual
focus can increase visual focus way increasing mental focus
abilities broadly. going explain that. Plasticity starts
alertness. mentioned before, alertness can come sense love,
sense joy, sense fear, doesn't matter. pharmacologic ways access
alertness too. common one course caffeine watch sleep
episodes, know reduces molecule makes us sleepy called adenosine.
drink plenty caffeine. heavy user caffeine. don't think abuser caffeine.
think reasonable amounts provided can still fall asleep night, caffeine can
relatively safe way

55:22 Adderall: Use & Abuse

increase epinephrin. Now, many people now also using Adderall. Adderall
chemically looks lot like amphetamine basically amphetamine. will increase
epinephrin release locus coeruleus, will wake brain lot


people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes
prescribed attention deficit. However, also high probability abuse
especially not prescribed it. Adderall will not increase focus,
increases alertness. not touch acetylcholine system.
taking Adderall say, "Well, really increases focus overall", probably
autonomic nervous system just veering towards call
parasympathetic. really just sleepy bringing levels
alertness up. mentioned, Adderall problematic number people
can habit forming. Learning Adderall not always translate high-
performance off Adderall later times. Adderall discussion broader
one perhaps psychiatrist room point
widely abused drug point time.

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog
bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused
anything. Think grazing animals, cows, sheep birds, et cetera.
think bird picking seeds beach concrete. bird's head
here. foot off ground, small bird six inches off
ground eyes side head yet tiny beak can
quickly pick little seeds off ground immense precision. Now, try
staring off sides room picking items front
high precision tiny scale, little tiny objects, will miss almost every time.
perfectly don't smash beak ground damage it,
beautiful movement acuity also. it? create
focus awareness front them? turns lower head,
eyes, briefly move inward, called vergence eye movement. Now
eyes can't actually translocate head, fixed skull, just like
mine are. move eyes slightly inward, maybe can tell
like basically shortening making inter pupillary distance called smaller.
Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,
activate set neurons brainstem trigger release
norepinephrine, epinephrin acetylcholine. Norepinephrine kind similar
epinephrin. words, eyes relaxed head just
kind looking entire visual environment, moving head around, moving
space optic flow, things moving past us sitting still,
looking broadly space, relaxed. eyes move slightly inward toward
particular visual target visual world shrinks, level visual focus goes


know relates release acetylcholine epinephrin relevant
sites brain plasticity. Now, means hard time
focusing mind sake reading listening, need practice can
practice focusing visual system. Now works best practice focusing
visual system precise distance, work intend sake
plasticity. look real world? say, trying concentrate
something related to, don't know, science, reading science paper
hard time, not absorbing. might think looking paper
reading. looking screen, actually eyes probably darting
around bit. Experiments done this. gathering information
many sources visual environment. Now, presumably me, already
coffee, hydrated. well rested, slept well. still experienced
challenges focusing spending just 60 120 seconds focusing visual attention
small window screen, meaning just screen nothing it, bringing
eyes particular location increases not just visual acuity location
brings increase activity bunch brain areas associated
gathering information location. put simply, want improve
ability focus practice visual focus. Now, wear contacts wear corrective
lenses, fine. course want use those. don't want take
off use blurry image. finer visual image can hold

1:02:59 Blinking

gaze visual image, higher levels attention will be. Many times
Instagram teased not blinking often. actually
practiced thing. blink get tired, hear probably just
say, duh. get tired, neurons brainstem responsible alertness
hold eyelids open start falter eyelids start close.
hard, words, "I barely keep eyes open" may feel right
now. assuming paying attention alert, alert,
eyes wide, eyes open. get tired, eyelids start close.
Blinks, actually reset perception time space. shown beautiful
paper Current Biology. sure post reference notes. blinking
course necessary lubricate eyes. People blink eyes might get dry.


can keep focused blinking less focusing eyes particular

can can maintain kind cone tunnel

blinking contest 14-year-old niece still beats every time
really bothers me, also just self practice learning blink less

entire discussion unto principle holds. need alertness.
can get mental tricks motivation, fear love, whatever is,
pharmacology, please healthfully. know, caffeine practice,

1:05:30 Ear Toward Learning

listening auditory cue doesn't involve vision all? look people
learning things auditory system, will often close eyes.
not coincidence. somebody listening hard, please don't ask look
directly eye also asking listen you. actually one
worst ways get somebody listen you. say, now listen look

55:22 Adderall: Use & Abuse

increase epinephrin. Now, many people now also using Adderall. Adderall
chemically looks lot like amphetamine basically amphetamine. will increase
epinephrin release locus coeruleus, will wake brain lot


people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes
prescribed attention deficit. However, also high probability abuse
especially not prescribed it. Adderall will not increase focus,
increases alertness. not touch acetylcholine system.
taking Adderall say, "Well, really increases focus overall", probably
autonomic nervous system just veering towards call
parasympathetic. really just sleepy bringing levels
alertness up. mentioned, Adderall problematic number people
can habit forming. Learning Adderall not always translate high-
performance off Adderall later times. Adderall discussion broader
one perhaps psychiatrist room point
widely abused drug point time.

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog
bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused
anything. Think grazing animals, cows, sheep birds, et cetera.
think bird picking seeds beach concrete. bird's head
here. foot off ground, small bird six inches off
ground eyes side head yet tiny beak can
quickly pick little seeds off ground immense precision. Now, try
staring off sides room picking items front
high precision tiny scale, little tiny objects, will miss almost every time.
perfectly don't smash beak ground damage it,
beautiful movement acuity also. it? create
focus awareness front them? turns lower head,
eyes, briefly move inward, called vergence eye movement. Now
eyes can't actually translocate head, fixed skull, just like
mine are. move eyes slightly inward, maybe can tell
like basically shortening making inter pupillary distance called smaller.
Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,
activate set neurons brainstem trigger release
norepinephrine, epinephrin acetylcholine. Norepinephrine kind similar
epinephrin. words, eyes relaxed head just
kind looking entire visual environment, moving head around, moving
space optic flow, things moving past us sitting still,
looking broadly space, relaxed. eyes move slightly inward toward
particular visual target visual world shrinks, level visual focus goes


know relates release acetylcholine epinephrin relevant
sites brain plasticity. Now, means hard time
focusing mind sake reading listening, need practice can
practice focusing visual system. Now works best practice focusing
visual system precise distance, work intend sake
plasticity. look real world? say, trying concentrate
something related to, don't know, science, reading science paper
hard time, not absorbing. might think looking paper
reading. looking screen, actually eyes probably darting
around bit. Experiments done this. gathering information
many sources visual environment. Now, presumably me, already
coffee, hydrated. well rested, slept well. still experienced
challenges focusing spending just 60 120 seconds focusing visual attention
small window screen, meaning just screen nothing it, bringing
eyes particular location increases not just visual acuity location
brings increase activity bunch brain areas associated
gathering information location. put simply, want improve
ability focus practice visual focus. Now, wear contacts wear corrective
lenses, fine. course want use those. don't want take
off use blurry image. finer visual image can hold

1:02:59 Blinking

gaze visual image, higher levels attention will be. Many times
Instagram teased not blinking often. actually
practiced thing. blink get tired, hear probably just
say, duh. get tired, neurons brainstem responsible alertness
hold eyelids open start falter eyelids start close.
hard, words, "I barely keep eyes open" may feel right
now. assuming paying attention alert, alert,
eyes wide, eyes open. get tired, eyelids start close.
Blinks, actually reset perception time space. shown beautiful
paper Current Biology. sure post reference notes. blinking
course necessary lubricate eyes. People blink eyes might get dry.


can keep focused blinking less focusing eyes particular
location probably pretty creepy experience this.
can can maintain kind cone tunnel
mental focus. sort revealing practice worked hard
blinking contest 14-year-old niece still beats every time
really bothers me, also just self practice learning blink less
focus visual attention smaller region space. Now me, important
mainly learning things computer screen. going
sport, quite bit different can discuss might translate sport.
fact, next episode, going talk plasticity focus
mechanisms relate learning movement practices coordinated movements.
entire discussion unto principle holds. need alertness.
can get mental tricks motivation, fear love, whatever is,
pharmacology, please healthfully. know, caffeine practice,
certainly want well hydrated increases actually will increase alertness. Well,
full bladder will increase alertness although don't want alertness
high can think fact go urinate 'cause
distracting. don't want alertness go roof. need
focus visual focus primary way start deploy
neurochemicals. Now may ask, well, experiment people
feeling rotating drum

1:05:30 Ear Toward Learning

listening auditory cue doesn't involve vision all? look people
learning things auditory system, will often close eyes.
not coincidence. somebody listening hard, please don't ask look
directly eye also asking listen you. actually one
worst ways get somebody listen you. say, now listen look
eye. visual system will take see mouth move,
going hear thoughts going hear saying. Closing
eyes one best ways create cone auditory attention.
low vision no vision folks do. tremendous capacity focus attention
particular locations.



1:06:14 Best Listeners World

Incidentally anyone know two animals best hearing world?
absolute best hearing many orders magnitude better humans. turns
elephant. might not surprise you, huge ears moth
probably will surprise you. didn't even know moths hear. now explains
hard catch. not sighted, learn
hearing. somebody braille reads, learn fingers.
look great piano players like Glenn Gould, often times will turn head
side. think great musicians like Stevie Wonder
blind, right? look away no reason look keys,
oftentimes orient ear one side head keys piano.
mentioned before, people non-sighted better pitch.
cones attention can devote. people, vision primary way
train focus building cones attention. absolutely focus
thing trying learn.

1:07:20 Agitation Key

will feel agitation epinephrin system.
feeling agitation challenging focus feeling like not
right chances right. can practice ability stare long
periods time without blinking. know little eerie people watch,

1:07:40 ADHD & ADD: Attention Deficit (Hyperactivity) Disorder

goal learn control visual window sake controlling
focus, can immensely powerful portal mechanisms plasticity,
know engages things like nucleus basalis brainstem
mechanisms. get lot questions attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD,
attention deficit disorder. people actually clinically diagnosed ADD
ADHD. do, certainly work good psychiatrist try figure
right pharmacology and/or behavioral practices you. Many people, however,


given low grade ADHD ADD way move
world. looking phone lot time. actually
easy anchor attention phone following reason. First all,
restricted size. easy limit visual attention something
big. one design features phone. other, just
probably heard picture worth thousand words, well, movie worth 10,000
pictures. Anytime looking things motion, visual motion, attentional
system will naturally gravitate towards them, towards movies. actually much
harder read words page used many people, used
seeing things spelled us YouTube videos videos things move
dramatic. true look motion stimulate,
seeing movies things things dramatic intense,
worst getting attending things like text page listening
something like podcast extracting information much think many
people asked me, "Hey know what, aren't providing intense visuals
us look at?" Well, frankly, lot people consuming content
pure auditory, through, listening. want able digest
material. addition that, think areas life dictate
whether not become successful, independent, healthy individuals,
involve kind boring practices digesting information page. Boring
not exciting moment perhaps watching movie something
spoonfed us. attention can put something, even fleeting
feel like getting little bits pieces, shards information
opposed entire thing, much powerful effect engaging
cholinergic system plasticity does, instance, watching movie.
watch movie, entire thing can great, can awesome.
can overriding experience think experiences,
somebody interested building brain expanding brain getting
better various things, feeling better, better, et cetera, one ask
much neurochemical resources devoting passive experience letting
something, just kind overwhelm excite me, versus something really
trying learn take away. now another enjoy movie content TV
content time. scroll Instagram often. limited extent
can grab hold acetylcholine release mechanisms epinephrin. think


need careful don't devote acetylcholine epinephrin,
dopamine matter passive experiences things not going
enrich us better us. little bit editorial part phone
rich movies, rich information. real question information rich
us ways grow us cultivate smarter, emotionally, know emotionally
evolved people, creating physical wellbeing matter?
don't want tell people not think carefully often
focusing something good poor focusing
something challenging.

1:12:00 Ultra(dian) Focus

get epinephrin, alertness, get acetylcholine released
can focus attention. question long? earlier
podcast, talked ultradian cycles lasts 90 minutes. typical
learning 90 minutes. think learning will no doubt
include five 10 minutes warmup period. think everyone give
permission not fully focused early part about. middle
middle hour able maintain focus
hour so. means eliminating distractions. means turning off wifi.
put phone room. find reflexively getting get phone
will take phone lock car outside. find going get anyway,
guilty giving away phone period time even things dramatic,
thrown roof can't get till end day. thing
pretty compelling come sorts reasons need it,
contact encourage try experiencing completely
immersed activity feel agitation attention drifting
continually bring back. important point attention drifts,
re-anchor it. keep grabbing back. way that,
sighted eyes. attention drifts, look away
want try literally maintain visual focus thing trying learn.

1:13:30 Real Change Occurs



Feel free blink, course, can greatly increase powers focus
rates learning anchored work Merzenich, Hubel Wiesel
others. Now trigger plasticity, real secret neuroplasticity
doesn't occur wakefulness. occurs sleep. now know focus
hard something 90 minutes so, maybe even several bouts
per day. can that, people can, people can one focus
learning, night following nights, asleep neural
circuits highlighted will acetylcholine transmission will strengthen
will lost, wonderful essence plasticity.
means eventually wake couple days week later,
will will acquired knowledge forever unless go process
actively unlearn it. will talk unlearning later episode. mastering
sleep key order reinforce learning occurs. say get really
poor night sleep learning. Chances are, sleep next night
following night learning will occur. stamp brain
acetylcholine released. actually marks synapses neurochemically
metabolically, synopses biased change. Now, don't
ever get deep sleep probably won't get changes. also way
can bypass need deep sleep least partially engaging
call Non Sleep Deep Rest, NSDR protocols. just want discuss signs
this. paper published Cell Reports last year shows
people did, spatial memory task, actually quite difficult one
remember sequence lights lighting just two three lights
particular sequence easy get 15 16 lights numbers
sequence actually gets quite challenging. immediately after, immediately
learning actual performance task, people took 20 minute Non Sleep
Deep Rest protocol took shallow nap, lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,
just closing eyes, no sensory input, rates learning significantly higher
information two just good night's sleep following night.
can actually accelerate learning NSDR protocols brief naps, 90
minutes less. key plasticity childhood child.

1:16:20 Much Learning Enough?



key plasticity adulthood engage alertness, engage focus
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest deep sleep typical sleep.
always get asked, "How many bouts learning can perform?" Well, know people
train visual focus mechanisms point can several 90
minute bouts throughout day, many three four. also
inserting Non Sleep Deep Rest well. Now can get pretty tricky.

1:16:50 Learning (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift

lot people find can recover best intense bouts focused
learning motor activity get self-generated optic flow.
make sense ever heard lecture stress done
little bit various podcasts. mode self-generated optic flow like
walking running cycling things just floating past us retina, not
really looking anywhere particular, opposite tight window focus.
that, areas brain like amygdala involved
releasing epinephrin create alertness. extremes, creates fear certainly
alertness, shut down. form non sleep deep rest.
people find much pleasurable practical engage focused
learning go activity involves essentially call
worldlessness not really thinking much anything.
listen audio books podcasts run may want consider
whether not want spend time right now. love
listening podcast run cycle, much interested
actually getting benefits neuroplasticity just listening sake
listening me. many people letting mind drift not organized
thought period deliberate focused effort best way accelerate
learning depth learning. good scientific data support sorts
things,

1:18:16 Synthesis/Summary

including Cell Reports paper mentioned moments ago. want
synthesize information covered now. entire month


neuroplasticity. Today's episode covered lot, no means
covered potential neuroplasticity protocols plasticity. will get
it. today want make sure key elements form backbone
neuroplasticity really embedded people's minds. First all, plasticity occurs
throughout lifespan. Early, birth 25, mere exposure sensory event can
create plasticity. good thing bad thing. going talk
unlearning bad stuff, traumas, et cetera subsequent episode month.
want learn adult, alert. might seem obvious think lot
people don't think 24 hour cycle, alert. four
episodes devoted 24-hour cycle cycles alertness sleep.
encourage listen haven't opportunity yet just ask
day typically tend alert? will afford
advantage learning specific things period time. don't give
period time things meaningless, useless, not aligned goals.
That'd terrible time get passive observance just letting time get
soaked away something. valuable asset, epinephrin, released
brainstem going occur readily particular phases 24-hour cycle
others, waking phase course. know are.
start think behavioral practices, maybe pharmacologic
practices like caffeine, hydration, et cetera will support heightened levels
alertness. Attention something can learned attention critical creating
condition whatever engaging will modify brain
way won't spend much attention going forward.
essence plasticity, things will eventually become reflexive. language
learning, motor movement, cognitive skill, ability suppress
emotional response engage emotional response depending goals
appropriate you. Increasing acetylcholine can accomplished
pharmacologically nicotine. However, certain dangers many people
well cost, financial cost, learning engage cholinergic
system use visual system, practicing long can maintain focus
blinks need them, long can maintain visual focus target,
just piece paper set feet away room level computer
screen. actually things people communities high levels
visual focus necessary. Now, way get high levels visual focus


alertness panic situation very, bad. will
immediately focused everything related situation, unfortunate.
really talking trying harness mechanisms attention get
better paying attention. may want auditory system, not
visual system, either low vision no vision,
trying learn something relates sounds see.
people trying learn information, cognitive information, trying learn
hear nuance partner's explanations emotionally challenging
events, et cetera. just remember, way, said earlier,
really want somebody listen really hear saying
underlying it, not, cannot expect look directly
that. actually going limit ability focus. trying rescue folks
might struggle. course never struggle.
supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus
entire period one 90-minute cycle. beginning end going little bit
flickering focus. know one 90-minute cycles
starting, typically wake os beginning first 90-minute cycle,


not minute. able tap sense 90-minute
cycles start engage learning practices choose.
course getting non sleep deep rest just deliberate disengagement,
walking running, just sitting, eyes closed eyes open kind mindlessly
might seem chair, just letting thoughts move around learning will
accelerate rate plasticity shown quality peer reviewed studies.
course, deep sleep. can start see plasticity
natural right early life. age 25 work order
access it. fortunately, beautiful experiments Hubel Wiesel
Merzenich Weinberger others point direction allows us achieve
plasticity,

1:25:15 Learning Repetition, Forming Habits

points neurochemicals circuits. now behavioral protocols
allow us that. also really want emphasize entire
aspect behavioral practices will allow us engage plasticity don't involve

supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus

course getting non sleep deep rest just deliberate disengagement,
walking running, just sitting, eyes closed eyes open kind mindlessly
might seem chair, just letting thoughts move around learning will
accelerate rate plasticity shown quality peer reviewed studies.
course, deep sleep. can start see plasticity

terms acetylcholine sport mental acuity, not just plasticity. Now
you, probably don't want chew Nicorette, definitely don't want smoke cigarettes
take supplements increasing acetylcholine. ways can
increase acetylcholine? there, going sound like bit circular argument
increase focus.

53:30 Focus

increase focus? know, people familiar sitting down, reading
couple pages book realizing none sunk talking someone
seeing mouth move, maybe even nodding head subconsciously none
sinks in. can damaging school, work performance relationships
many know. Costello incidentally never seems pay attention anything say
looking directly me, contradicts say,
best way get better focusing use mechanisms focus born
with. key principle mental focus follows visual focus.
familiar fact visual system can unfocused, blurry jumping around
can laser focused one location space. interesting vitally
important understanding access neuroplasticity can use visual
focus can increase visual focus way increasing mental focus
abilities broadly. going explain that. Plasticity starts
alertness. mentioned before, alertness can come sense love,
sense joy, sense fear, doesn't matter. pharmacologic ways access
alertness too. common one course caffeine watch sleep
episodes, know reduces molecule makes us sleepy called adenosine.
drink plenty caffeine. heavy user caffeine. don't think abuser caffeine.
think reasonable amounts provided can still fall asleep night, caffeine can
relatively safe way

55:22 Adderall: Use & Abuse

increase epinephrin. Now, many people now also using Adderall. Adderall
chemically looks lot like amphetamine basically amphetamine. will increase
epinephrin release locus coeruleus, will wake brain lot


people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes
prescribed attention deficit. However, also high probability abuse
especially not prescribed it. Adderall will not increase focus,
increases alertness. not touch acetylcholine system.
taking Adderall say, "Well, really increases focus overall", probably
autonomic nervous system just veering towards call
parasympathetic. really just sleepy bringing levels
alertness up. mentioned, Adderall problematic number people
can habit forming. Learning Adderall not always translate high-
performance off Adderall later times. Adderall discussion broader
one perhaps psychiatrist room point
widely abused drug point time.

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog
bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused
anything. Think grazing animals, cows, sheep birds, et cetera.
think bird picking seeds beach concrete. bird's head
here. foot off ground, small bird six inches off
ground eyes side head yet tiny beak can
quickly pick little seeds off ground immense precision. Now, try
staring off sides room picking items front
high precision tiny scale, little tiny objects, will miss almost every time.
perfectly don't smash beak ground damage it,
beautiful movement acuity also. it? create
focus awareness front them? turns lower head,
eyes, briefly move inward, called vergence eye movement. Now
eyes can't actually translocate head, fixed skull, just like
mine are. move eyes slightly inward, maybe can tell
like basically shortening making inter pupillary distance called smaller.
Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,
activate set neurons brainstem trigger release
norepinephrine, epinephrin acetylcholine. Norepinephrine kind similar
epinephrin. words, eyes relaxed head just
kind looking entire visual environment, moving head around, moving
space optic flow, things moving past us sitting still,
looking broadly space, relaxed. eyes move slightly inward toward
particular visual target visual world shrinks, level visual focus goes


know relates release acetylcholine epinephrin relevant
sites brain plasticity. Now, means hard time
focusing mind sake reading listening, need practice can
practice focusing visual system. Now works best practice focusing

alertness. Attention something can learned attention critical creating
condition whatever engaging will modify brain
way won't spend much attention going forward.
essence plasticity, things will eventually become reflexive. language
learning, motor movement, cognitive skill, ability suppress
emotional response engage emotional response depending goals
appropriate you. Increasing acetylcholine can accomplished
pharmacologically nicotine. However, certain dangers many people
well cost, financial cost, learning engage cholinergic

blinks need them, long can maintain visual focus target,
just piece paper set feet away room level computer

visual focus necessary. Now, way get high levels visual focus


alertness panic situation very, bad. will
immediately focused everything related situation, unfortunate.
really talking trying harness mechanisms attention get
better paying attention. may want auditory system, not
visual system, either low vision no vision,
trying learn something relates sounds see.
people trying learn information, cognitive information, trying learn
hear nuance partner's explanations emotionally challenging

really want somebody listen really hear saying
underlying it, not, cannot expect look directly
that. actually going limit ability focus. trying rescue folks
might struggle. course never struggle.
supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus
entire period one 90-minute cycle. beginning end going little bit
flickering focus. know one 90-minute cycles
starting, typically wake os beginning first 90-minute cycle,


not minute. able tap sense 90-minute

course getting non sleep deep rest just deliberate disengagement,
walking running, just sitting, eyes closed eyes open kind mindlessly

people rely it. heavy basis use certain clinical syndromes
prescribed attention deficit. However, also high probability abuse
especially not prescribed it. Adderall will not increase focus,
increases alertness. not touch acetylcholine system.
taking Adderall say, "Well, really increases focus overall", probably
autonomic nervous system just veering towards call
parasympathetic. really just sleepy bringing levels
alertness up. mentioned, Adderall problematic number people
can habit forming. Learning Adderall not always translate high-
performance off Adderall later times. Adderall discussion broader
one perhaps psychiatrist room point
widely abused drug point time.

56:40 Seeing Way Mental Focus

acetylcholine system focus brings available mentioned
pharmacology, also behavioral practices. behavioral practices
anchored visual focus going ones going allow
develop great depth duration focus. think visual focus second.
focus something visually, two options. can either look
small region space lot detail lot precision can dilate gaze
can see big pieces visual space little detail. trade-off. can't
look everything high resolution. these, pupil less
relates fovea eye area receptors,
highest density receptors perceive light. acuity much better
center visual field periphery. simple experiment can right
now. listening this, can still it. can hold feet hands
front you. Provided sighted able see many
fingers front you. me, five. still got five fingers, amazingly
enough. move hand off side, can't see precision, moved
back center visual field can see precision.
density, number pixels center visual field much higher
periphery. focus eyes, couple things. First all,
tend center visual field two eyes tend align


called vergence eye movement towards common point. thing happens
lens eye moves brain now no longer sees entire visual world
seeing small cone visual imagery. [door banging] it... dog
bumping wall, forgive me. small cone visual imagery soda straw view
world much higher acuity, higher resolution look everything.
Now see, course, makes perfect sense visual attention, not
mental attention. Well, turns focus brain anchored visual
system. talk blind people moment assuming somebody sighted,
key learn focus better visually, want bring higher levels
cognitive mental focus, even engaged physical task. Now
remarkable phenomenon animals animals eyes side
head scanning entire visual environment time. not focused
anything. Think grazing animals, cows, sheep birds, et cetera.
think bird picking seeds beach concrete. bird's head
here. foot off ground, small bird six inches off
ground eyes side head yet tiny beak can
quickly pick little seeds off ground immense precision. Now, try
staring off sides room picking items front
high precision tiny scale, little tiny objects, will miss almost every time.
perfectly don't smash beak ground damage it,
beautiful movement acuity also. it? create
focus awareness front them? turns lower head,
eyes, briefly move inward, called vergence eye movement. Now
eyes can't actually translocate head, fixed skull, just like
mine are. move eyes slightly inward, maybe can tell
like basically shortening making inter pupillary distance called smaller.
Two things happen. Not develop smaller visual window world,
activate set neurons brainstem trigger release
norepinephrine, epinephrin acetylcholine. Norepinephrine kind similar
epinephrin. words, eyes relaxed head just
kind looking entire visual environment, moving head around, moving
space optic flow, things moving past us sitting still,
looking broadly space, relaxed. eyes move slightly inward toward
particular visual target visual world shrinks, level visual focus goes


know relates release acetylcholine epinephrin relevant
sites brain plasticity. Now, means hard time
focusing mind sake reading listening, need practice can
practice focusing visual system. Now works best practice focusing
visual system precise distance, work intend sake
plasticity. look real world? say, trying concentrate
something related to, don't know, science, reading science paper
hard time, not absorbing. might think looking paper
reading. looking screen, actually eyes probably darting
around bit. Experiments done this. gathering information
many sources visual environment. Now, presumably me, already
coffee, hydrated. well rested, slept well. still experienced
challenges focusing spending just 60 120 seconds focusing visual attention
small window screen, meaning just screen nothing it, bringing
eyes particular location increases not just visual acuity location
brings increase activity bunch brain areas associated
gathering information location. put simply, want improve
ability focus practice visual focus. Now, wear contacts wear corrective
lenses, fine. course want use those. don't want take
off use blurry image. finer visual image can hold

1:02:59 Blinking

gaze visual image, higher levels attention will be. Many times
Instagram teased not blinking often. actually
practiced thing. blink get tired, hear probably just
say, duh. get tired, neurons brainstem responsible alertness
hold eyelids open start falter eyelids start close.
hard, words, "I barely keep eyes open" may feel right
now. assuming paying attention alert, alert,
eyes wide, eyes open. get tired, eyelids start close.
Blinks, actually reset perception time space. shown beautiful
paper Current Biology. sure post reference notes. blinking
course necessary lubricate eyes. People blink eyes might get dry.


can keep focused blinking less focusing eyes particular
location probably pretty creepy experience this.
can can maintain kind cone tunnel
mental focus. sort revealing practice worked hard
blinking contest 14-year-old niece still beats every time
really bothers me, also just self practice learning blink less
focus visual attention smaller region space. Now me, important
mainly learning things computer screen. going
sport, quite bit different can discuss might translate sport.
fact, next episode, going talk plasticity focus
mechanisms relate learning movement practices coordinated movements.
entire discussion unto principle holds. need alertness.
can get mental tricks motivation, fear love, whatever is,
pharmacology, please healthfully. know, caffeine practice,
certainly want well hydrated increases actually will increase alertness. Well,
full bladder will increase alertness although don't want alertness
high can think fact go urinate 'cause
distracting. don't want alertness go roof. need
focus visual focus primary way start deploy
neurochemicals. Now may ask, well, experiment people
feeling rotating drum

1:05:30 Ear Toward Learning

listening auditory cue doesn't involve vision all? look people
learning things auditory system, will often close eyes.
not coincidence. somebody listening hard, please don't ask look
directly eye also asking listen you. actually one
worst ways get somebody listen you. say, now listen look
eye. visual system will take see mouth move,
going hear thoughts going hear saying. Closing
eyes one best ways create cone auditory attention.
low vision no vision folks do. tremendous capacity focus attention
particular locations.



1:06:14 Best Listeners World

Incidentally anyone know two animals best hearing world?
absolute best hearing many orders magnitude better humans. turns
elephant. might not surprise you, huge ears moth
probably will surprise you. didn't even know moths hear. now explains
hard catch. not sighted, learn
hearing. somebody braille reads, learn fingers.
look great piano players like Glenn Gould, often times will turn head
side. think great musicians like Stevie Wonder
blind, right? look away no reason look keys,
oftentimes orient ear one side head keys piano.
mentioned before, people non-sighted better pitch.
cones attention can devote. people, vision primary way
train focus building cones attention. absolutely focus
thing trying learn.

1:07:20 Agitation Key

will feel agitation epinephrin system.
feeling agitation challenging focus feeling like not

1:07:40 ADHD & ADD: Attention Deficit (Hyperactivity) Disorder

goal learn control visual window sake controlling
focus, can immensely powerful portal mechanisms plasticity,
know engages things like nucleus basalis brainstem
mechanisms. get lot questions attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD,
attention deficit disorder. people actually clinically diagnosed ADD
ADHD. do, certainly work good psychiatrist try figure
right pharmacology and/or behavioral practices you. Many people, however,


given low grade ADHD ADD way move
world. looking phone lot time. actually
easy anchor attention phone following reason. First all,
restricted size. easy limit visual attention something
big. one design features phone. other, just
probably heard picture worth thousand words, well, movie worth 10,000
pictures. Anytime looking things motion, visual motion, attentional
system will naturally gravitate towards them, towards movies. actually much
harder read words page used many people, used
seeing things spelled us YouTube videos videos things move
dramatic. true look motion stimulate,
seeing movies things things dramatic intense,
worst getting attending things like text page listening
something like podcast extracting information much think many
people asked me, "Hey know what, aren't providing intense visuals
us look at?" Well, frankly, lot people consuming content
pure auditory, through, listening. want able digest
material. addition that, think areas life dictate
whether not become successful, independent, healthy individuals,
involve kind boring practices digesting information page. Boring
not exciting moment perhaps watching movie something
spoonfed us. attention can put something, even fleeting
feel like getting little bits pieces, shards information
opposed entire thing, much powerful effect engaging
cholinergic system plasticity does, instance, watching movie.
watch movie, entire thing can great, can awesome.
can overriding experience think experiences,
somebody interested building brain expanding brain getting
better various things, feeling better, better, et cetera, one ask
much neurochemical resources devoting passive experience letting
something, just kind overwhelm excite me, versus something really
trying learn take away. now another enjoy movie content TV
content time. scroll Instagram often. limited extent
can grab hold acetylcholine release mechanisms epinephrin. think


need careful don't devote acetylcholine epinephrin,
dopamine matter passive experiences things not going
enrich us better us. little bit editorial part phone
rich movies, rich information. real question information rich
us ways grow us cultivate smarter, emotionally, know emotionally
evolved people, creating physical wellbeing matter?
don't want tell people not think carefully often
focusing something good poor focusing
something challenging.

1:12:00 Ultra(dian) Focus

get epinephrin, alertness, get acetylcholine released
can focus attention. question long? earlier
podcast, talked ultradian cycles lasts 90 minutes. typical
learning 90 minutes. think learning will no doubt
include five 10 minutes warmup period. think everyone give
permission not fully focused early part about. middle
middle hour able maintain focus
hour so. means eliminating distractions. means turning off wifi.
put phone room. find reflexively getting get phone
will take phone lock car outside. find going get anyway,
guilty giving away phone period time even things dramatic,
thrown roof can't get till end day. thing
pretty compelling come sorts reasons need it,
contact encourage try experiencing completely
immersed activity feel agitation attention drifting
continually bring back. important point attention drifts,
re-anchor it. keep grabbing back. way that,
sighted eyes. attention drifts, look away
want try literally maintain visual focus thing trying learn.

1:13:30 Real Change Occurs



Feel free blink, course, can greatly increase powers focus
rates learning anchored work Merzenich, Hubel Wiesel
others. Now trigger plasticity, real secret neuroplasticity
doesn't occur wakefulness. occurs sleep. now know focus
hard something 90 minutes so, maybe even several bouts
per day. can that, people can, people can one focus
learning, night following nights, asleep neural
circuits highlighted will acetylcholine transmission will strengthen
will lost, wonderful essence plasticity.
means eventually wake couple days week later,
will will acquired knowledge forever unless go process
actively unlearn it. will talk unlearning later episode. mastering
sleep key order reinforce learning occurs. say get really
poor night sleep learning. Chances are, sleep next night
following night learning will occur. stamp brain
acetylcholine released. actually marks synapses neurochemically
metabolically, synopses biased change. Now, don't
ever get deep sleep probably won't get changes. also way
can bypass need deep sleep least partially engaging
call Non Sleep Deep Rest, NSDR protocols. just want discuss signs
this. paper published Cell Reports last year shows
people did, spatial memory task, actually quite difficult one
remember sequence lights lighting just two three lights
particular sequence easy get 15 16 lights numbers
sequence actually gets quite challenging. immediately after, immediately
learning actual performance task, people took 20 minute Non Sleep
Deep Rest protocol took shallow nap, lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,
just closing eyes, no sensory input, rates learning significantly higher
information two just good night's sleep following night.
can actually accelerate learning NSDR protocols brief naps, 90
minutes less. key plasticity childhood child.

1:16:20 Much Learning Enough?



key plasticity adulthood engage alertness, engage focus
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest deep sleep typical sleep.
always get asked, "How many bouts learning can perform?" Well, know people
train visual focus mechanisms point can several 90
minute bouts throughout day, many three four. also
inserting Non Sleep Deep Rest well. Now can get pretty tricky.

1:16:50 Learning (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift

lot people find can recover best intense bouts focused
learning motor activity get self-generated optic flow.
make sense ever heard lecture stress done
little bit various podcasts. mode self-generated optic flow like
walking running cycling things just floating past us retina, not
really looking anywhere particular, opposite tight window focus.
that, areas brain like amygdala involved
releasing epinephrin create alertness. extremes, creates fear certainly
alertness, shut down. form non sleep deep rest.
people find much pleasurable practical engage focused
learning go activity involves essentially call
worldlessness not really thinking much anything.
listen audio books podcasts run may want consider
whether not want spend time right now. love
listening podcast run cycle, much interested
actually getting benefits neuroplasticity just listening sake
listening me. many people letting mind drift not organized
thought period deliberate focused effort best way accelerate
learning depth learning. good scientific data support sorts
things,

neuroplasticity really embedded people's minds. First all, plasticity occurs
throughout lifespan. Early, birth 25, mere exposure sensory event can
create plasticity. good thing bad thing. going talk

That'd terrible time get passive observance just letting time get

others, waking phase course. know are.
start think behavioral practices, maybe pharmacologic

1:13:30 Real Change Occurs



Feel free blink, course, can greatly increase powers focus
rates learning anchored work Merzenich, Hubel Wiesel
others. Now trigger plasticity, real secret neuroplasticity
doesn't occur wakefulness. occurs sleep. now know focus
hard something 90 minutes so, maybe even several bouts

learning, night following nights, asleep neural
circuits highlighted will acetylcholine transmission will strengthen
will lost, wonderful essence plasticity.
means eventually wake couple days week later,
will will acquired knowledge forever unless go process
actively unlearn it. will talk unlearning later episode. mastering
sleep key order reinforce learning occurs. say get really
poor night sleep learning. Chances are, sleep next night
following night learning will occur. stamp brain
acetylcholine released. actually marks synapses neurochemically
metabolically, synopses biased change. Now, don't
ever get deep sleep probably won't get changes. also way
can bypass need deep sleep least partially engaging
call Non Sleep Deep Rest, NSDR protocols. just want discuss signs
this. paper published Cell Reports last year shows
people did, spatial memory task, actually quite difficult one
remember sequence lights lighting just two three lights
particular sequence easy get 15 16 lights numbers
sequence actually gets quite challenging. immediately after, immediately
learning actual performance task, people took 20 minute Non Sleep
Deep Rest protocol took shallow nap, lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,
just closing eyes, no sensory input, rates learning significantly higher
information two just good night's sleep following night.
can actually accelerate learning NSDR protocols brief naps, 90
minutes less. key plasticity childhood child.

1:16:20 Much Learning Enough?



key plasticity adulthood engage alertness, engage focus
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest deep sleep typical sleep.
always get asked, "How many bouts learning can perform?" Well, know people
train visual focus mechanisms point can several 90
minute bouts throughout day, many three four. also
inserting Non Sleep Deep Rest well. Now can get pretty tricky.

1:16:50 Learning (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift

lot people find can recover best intense bouts focused
learning motor activity get self-generated optic flow.
make sense ever heard lecture stress done
little bit various podcasts. mode self-generated optic flow like
walking running cycling things just floating past us retina, not
really looking anywhere particular, opposite tight window focus.
that, areas brain like amygdala involved
releasing epinephrin create alertness. extremes, creates fear certainly
alertness, shut down. form non sleep deep rest.
people find much pleasurable practical engage focused
learning go activity involves essentially call
worldlessness not really thinking much anything.
listen audio books podcasts run may want consider
whether not want spend time right now. love
listening podcast run cycle, much interested
actually getting benefits neuroplasticity just listening sake
listening me. many people letting mind drift not organized

things,

1:18:16 Synthesis/Summary

including Cell Reports paper mentioned moments ago. want
synthesize information covered now. entire month


neuroplasticity. Today's episode covered lot, no means
covered potential neuroplasticity protocols plasticity. will get
it. today want make sure key elements form backbone
neuroplasticity really embedded people's minds. First all, plasticity occurs
throughout lifespan. Early, birth 25, mere exposure sensory event can
create plasticity. good thing bad thing. going talk
unlearning bad stuff, traumas, et cetera subsequent episode month.
want learn adult, alert. might seem obvious think lot
people don't think 24 hour cycle, alert. four
episodes devoted 24-hour cycle cycles alertness sleep.
encourage listen haven't opportunity yet just ask
day typically tend alert? will afford
advantage learning specific things period time. don't give
period time things meaningless, useless, not aligned goals.
That'd terrible time get passive observance just letting time get
soaked away something. valuable asset, epinephrin, released
brainstem going occur readily particular phases 24-hour cycle
others, waking phase course. know are.
start think behavioral practices, maybe pharmacologic
practices like caffeine, hydration, et cetera will support heightened levels
alertness. Attention something can learned attention critical creating
condition whatever engaging will modify brain
way won't spend much attention going forward.
essence plasticity, things will eventually become reflexive. language
learning, motor movement, cognitive skill, ability suppress
emotional response engage emotional response depending goals
appropriate you. Increasing acetylcholine can accomplished
pharmacologically nicotine. However, certain dangers many people
well cost, financial cost, learning engage cholinergic
system use visual system, practicing long can maintain focus
blinks need them, long can maintain visual focus target,
just piece paper set feet away room level computer
screen. actually things people communities high levels
visual focus necessary. Now, way get high levels visual focus


alertness panic situation very, bad. will
immediately focused everything related situation, unfortunate.
really talking trying harness mechanisms attention get
better paying attention. may want auditory system, not
visual system, either low vision no vision,
trying learn something relates sounds see.
people trying learn information, cognitive information, trying learn
hear nuance partner's explanations emotionally challenging
events, et cetera. just remember, way, said earlier,
really want somebody listen really hear saying
underlying it, not, cannot expect look directly
that. actually going limit ability focus. trying rescue folks
might struggle. course never struggle.
supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus
entire period one 90-minute cycle. beginning end going little bit
flickering focus. know one 90-minute cycles
starting, typically wake os beginning first 90-minute cycle,


not minute. able tap sense 90-minute
cycles start engage learning practices choose.
course getting non sleep deep rest just deliberate disengagement,
walking running, just sitting, eyes closed eyes open kind mindlessly
might seem chair, just letting thoughts move around learning will
accelerate rate plasticity shown quality peer reviewed studies.
course, deep sleep. can start see plasticity
natural right early life. age 25 work order
access it. fortunately, beautiful experiments Hubel Wiesel
Merzenich Weinberger others point direction allows us achieve
plasticity,

1:25:15 Learning Repetition, Forming Habits

points neurochemicals circuits. now behavioral protocols
allow us that. also really want emphasize entire
aspect behavioral practices will allow us engage plasticity don't involve

repeatedly incorporating reward system
involves dopamine. today talked kind plasticity comes
extreme focus. get extreme focus alertness naturally
harder, difficult event didn't want. kind stinger brain

hot stove engaging really horrible person. can get incredible plasticity
positive experiences things want engaging high focus regime
rest, non sleep deep rest, sleep. another aspect plasticity
will explore next episode well explore movement-based practices
enhancing plasticity plasticity movement itself. not high

talked magnesium threonate sleep aid take. magnesium glycinate
magnesium threonate essentially interchangeable. Thanks much time
attention, always thank interest science.


know relates release acetylcholine epinephrin relevant
sites brain plasticity. Now, means hard time
focusing mind sake reading listening, need practice can
practice focusing visual system. Now works best practice focusing
visual system precise distance, work intend sake
plasticity. look real world? say, trying concentrate
something related to, don't know, science, reading science paper
hard time, not absorbing. might think looking paper
reading. looking screen, actually eyes probably darting
around bit. Experiments done this. gathering information
many sources visual environment. Now, presumably me, already
coffee, hydrated. well rested, slept well. still experienced
challenges focusing spending just 60 120 seconds focusing visual attention
small window screen, meaning just screen nothing it, bringing
eyes particular location increases not just visual acuity location
brings increase activity bunch brain areas associated
gathering information location. put simply, want improve
ability focus practice visual focus. Now, wear contacts wear corrective
lenses, fine. course want use those. don't want take
off use blurry image. finer visual image can hold

1:02:59 Blinking

gaze visual image, higher levels attention will be. Many times
Instagram teased not blinking often. actually
practiced thing. blink get tired, hear probably just
say, duh. get tired, neurons brainstem responsible alertness
hold eyelids open start falter eyelids start close.
hard, words, "I barely keep eyes open" may feel right
now. assuming paying attention alert, alert,
eyes wide, eyes open. get tired, eyelids start close.
Blinks, actually reset perception time space. shown beautiful
paper Current Biology. sure post reference notes. blinking
course necessary lubricate eyes. People blink eyes might get dry.


can keep focused blinking less focusing eyes particular
location probably pretty creepy experience this.
can can maintain kind cone tunnel
mental focus. sort revealing practice worked hard
blinking contest 14-year-old niece still beats every time
really bothers me, also just self practice learning blink less
focus visual attention smaller region space. Now me, important
mainly learning things computer screen. going
sport, quite bit different can discuss might translate sport.
fact, next episode, going talk plasticity focus
mechanisms relate learning movement practices coordinated movements.
entire discussion unto principle holds. need alertness.
can get mental tricks motivation, fear love, whatever is,
pharmacology, please healthfully. know, caffeine practice,
certainly want well hydrated increases actually will increase alertness. Well,
full bladder will increase alertness although don't want alertness
high can think fact go urinate 'cause
distracting. don't want alertness go roof. need
focus visual focus primary way start deploy
neurochemicals. Now may ask, well, experiment people
feeling rotating drum

1:05:30 Ear Toward Learning

listening auditory cue doesn't involve vision all? look people
learning things auditory system, will often close eyes.
not coincidence. somebody listening hard, please don't ask look
directly eye also asking listen you. actually one
worst ways get somebody listen you. say, now listen look
eye. visual system will take see mouth move,
going hear thoughts going hear saying. Closing

supposed joke. familiar struggle know one can
get better listening, one can get better learning, one can get better sorts
things anchoring mechanisms. Now, course can also combine
protocols. can decide combine pharmacology learning practices. Many
people communities that. Many people naturally drinking
coffee right learning. also encourage think
long learning bouts are. think ADD ADHD, see clinician
also ask giving best period focus
day naturally thing like social media activity
doesn't serve well devoting period opportunity learn?
also ask whether not trying focus much long
day. know high performing individuals, high-performing
variety contexts none focused day long. Many take walks
hallway, sometimes mumbling themselves, not paying attention
anything else. go bike rides, take walks. not trying engage
mind maximum focus time. people learn best
90 minute bouts inside one ultradian cycles. repeat
again, within 90-minute cycle, not expect focus
