00:12:07 Protocol 2: Self-Generate Forward Motion (Outdoors)

time temperature lowest point, valuable thing know.
second thing wake get forward ambulation, just nerd
speak taking walk. dog, many know, bulldog
doesn't really like walk, especially not morning. humans animals,
phenomenon whereby generate forward motion, forward
ambulation, visual images pass us eyes, so-called "optic flow."
low vision no vision, phenomenon occurs auditory

ambulation, especially experiencing visual flow, powerful effect
nervous system. effect essentially quiet reduce amount neural
activity brain structure called "amygdala." Amygdala means "almond,"
many probably heard amygdala role anxiety fear
threat detection. indeed, amygdala part network brain
generates feelings fear threat anxiety. bunch things too,
one primary functions. now least half dozen quality papers
published quality, peer-reviewed journals show forward ambulation, walking
biking running, generating optic flow particular incredible property
lowering activity amygdala thereby reducing levels anxiety. two
papers like highlight particular relate phenomenon. first one


published journal Neuron title paper "Whole-Brain Functional

species moment. found essentially mice walk
forward eyes move side side, natural consequence
moving forward, so-called "optic flow" flowing past eyes, many brain areas
activated, increase level firing, amygdala particular reduced levels

Movement Intervention Enhances Extinction via Amygdala Deactivation," published
Journal Neuroscience, strong journal, shows that, again, eye
movements, lateral eye movements side side reduce activity levels
fear/threat/anxiety center brain, amygdala. Now, eye movements.
didn't specifically look forward ambulation. yet papers looked
forward ambulation know forward ambulation, walking forward, generates

me, process taking walk morning isn't exercise. not
burning calories. not that. really getting optic flow
reducing levels amygdala activation. Now, don't anxiety, least don't
chronic anxiety generalized anxiety. tend lot energy,
points morning, not energetic. Sometimes sort shuffling

make sure walking done outdoors. might sort duh, many
people get start moving around house, apartment, don't go

outdoors also want sunlight eyes. know many heard
talk ad nauseam various podcasts, podcast, getting sunlight
eyes first thing morning absolutely vital mental physical health.
perhaps important thing us can order

get mental health steering right direction. number reasons
this, get reasons, let just emphasize protocol is.
protocol get outdoors, ideally no sunglasses can safely, even

actually discovered animals, tested humans verified
also exist humans. Not always. Sometimes reverse, tested
first humans, brought animals. indeed, dog, horse,
know, don't know animals there, need this. Now,
hamster nocturnal animal, reason like run wheels night
nocturnal. don't like light. Light actually causes

00:28:00 Protocol 5: Delay Caffeine 90-120m Waking

not much, do. drink less room temperature. find
drinking really cold water first thing day kind like cramps insides,
don't that. point, start thinking fantasizing craving
caffeine, don't drink caffeine yet. purposely delay caffeine intake 90
minutes 120 minutes wake up. course, know wake 'cause wrote
down, although pretty easy commit memory. reason delay caffeine
one factors induces sense sleepiness buildup
adenosine or, people call it, adenosine system. buildup adenosine
accumulates longer awake. wake morning,
wake morning, adenosine levels likely low. However,
caffeine adenosine blocker. actually competitive antagonist
aficionados. sort parks receptor adenosine normally park
prevents adenosine acting receptor. feel alert,
essentially blocking effect sleepiness factor create
called "adenosine." reason delaying caffeine intake 90 minutes two hours
waking want make sure don't late afternoon even early
afternoon crash caffeine. One best ways ensure caffeine crash
drink bunch caffeine, block adenosine receptors, early late
afternoon, caffeine starts wear off gets dislodged receptors,
lower level adenosine able create greater level sleepiness. took years
figure out. used wake think, "Oh, don't want drink caffeine
close bedtime, going start drinking caffeine really early." let cortisol
naturally come morning. avoid drinking caffeine 90 minutes two
hours waking. that, find don't experience afternoon crash.


least don't experience crash unless something foolish, like ingest far
much food lunch stay night night before. provided don't anything
foolish like that, delaying caffeine 90 minutes two hours optimizes relationship
adenosine wakefulness sleepiness way really provides nice,
consistent arc energy throughout day brings energy headed
toward sleep falling asleep. primary objective early day get
mode focused, yet alert can get work done.

00:30:48 Protocol 6: Fast (or Fat-Fast) Noon

found best way achieve state fasting. don't eat
anything 11:00 12:00 noon. not absolutely religious it.

instance, days not that. just not eating anything. drinking
caffeine caffeine source yerba mate, guayusa tea. preferred
sources tend avoid coffee days. Occasionally cup, often
stick teas. drink water much feel need want to. also drink
athletic greens, compatible least fasting. talk
fasting works create heightened state alertness, yet calm brain state. Fasting
increases levels adrenaline, also called "epinephrin" brain body.
levels epinephrin adrenaline increased, learn better, can focus
better. terrific data supporting that. don't want epinephrine, aka adrenaline,
high. feels like stress panic. get jittery, can't focus.
optimal range, adrenaline really provides heightened sense focus ability
encode, meaning bring in, retain, remember information. since job

00:32:30 Actually Breaks Fast & Doesn’t?

YouTube comments internet, breaks fast doesn't.
fact matter going highly individual going depend


sensitive blood sugar. accurately, going depend things like
insulin sensitivity. instance, somebody gets morning,
hydrates, goes six-mile run, probably eat jar almond butter
still called fat-fasted. insulin levels will still low even
though large volume almond butter, even Costello, large
number calories comes source doesn't increase blood sugar much
insulin much. Now, not suggesting that, just described
vastly different situation somebody ate last meal 2:00 AM,
meal essentially feast. person, fasting 10:00 11:00 AM,
blood sugar might still actually pretty high even lowish might eat one
almond bump fasting. get idea. going depend

Yes. get big blip blood sugar insulin that. However, long

00:34:30 Fat Loss & Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP1), Yerba Mate, Guayusa Tea

fasting early day, period time work. One
interesting fact yerba mate guayusa teas increase release
something called "GLP-1." GLP-1 related glucagon. Glucagon hormone
can sort think opposite insulin blood sugar. complex
that, GLP-1 couple positive properties. One increases lipolysis
mobilization body fat stores, burning fat. fact, now number
clinical trials achieving good success drugs
available prescription mimic GLP-1 used treat, quite
successfully, certain types diabetes obesity. Now, not diabetic, trying
shed ton body fat, figure long fasting long like yerba


mate guayusa, do, delicious, tell type use
moment, might well increase GLP-1 probably not good getting
cardio work. nonetheless, fasted, increasing GLP-1
system, going alert caffeine, adrenaline, et cetera, going

don't know, maybe sort Y chromosome-associated lesion early life,
don't like smoky flavors. not Gouda cheese guy. don't like smoky stuff.
may love it, tend avoid smoky-tasting mates. Instead, particular brand
just found internet called Anna Park. don't know Anna, don't know
park, certainly don't know Anna Park is, me, best-
tasting yerba mate. Again, don't relationship them, affordable
context yerba mate one use. mention along lines
affordability GLP-1 nice feature yerba mate put

testosterone estrogen optimization. just want briefly highlight two things
relevant, want details, please go see episode.
first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free
testosterone. make particular binding protein called "sex hormone binding
globulin" essentially binds testosterone, prevents free. sounds
like terrible thing, actually good thing allows testosterone
transported various tissues, including brain, can exert various
functions. lower desired levels testosterone much sex
hormone binding globulin, turns 400 milligrams per day something called
"tongkat ali," form ginseng, can actually help increase levels free
testosterone. Many people experience positive subjective effect objective
affects well, meaning increases free testosterone blood analysis.

taking walk, walk dog again, protocol, order get evening light,
lowers sensitivity retina late evening hours,
allows buffer negative effects bright light later night.
Now, won't allow blast eyes bright light; still need dim lights
evening. nice study published scientific reports
illustrates one this, go outside view sunlight evening hours
anywhere five 30 minutes, realized people range

melatonin rhythm stays appropriate. Now, haven't talked much melatonin,
melatonin hormone inhibited light. actually prevented light.
melatonin hormone allows fall asleep easily. Now, not talking
supplementing melatonin; talking melatonin naturally produce
pineal. protocol simple: get outside afternoon evening 10
30 minutes, take sunglasses off, get bright light, get natural light

try capture rising phase temperature. now,
emphasizing practices allow optimize level alertness

looks like, structured within day structured across weeks
fact, based scientific data scientific data say best optimal
order promote longevity brain, ability focus, well cardiovascular health
things know exercise supports. Now, various forms
physical activity call exercise, can generally batched two
categories. First strength hypertrophy work. physical movements
designed make stronger and/or make muscles larger. also
endurance work. Physical exercise movements designed allow
work time extend amount time can work kind,
physical mental. two full podcast episodes details
science protocols related topics. episode science
strength hypertrophy, building strength muscle building. included
lot protocols. episode endurance. build one
four types endurance, muscular endurance, anaerobic, aerobic, long-

please see episodes. However, right now just want emphasize data
impact day structure day way can incorporate physical
movement way supports brain health. Basically, finished

can actually detrimental way raises cortisol. cortisol can
good thing appropriately timed appropriate low levels, don't
want cortisol levels throughout day big spikes cortisol
repeatedly. keeping workouts relatively short can definitely help
certainly training hard, 60 minutes less sufficient.
many people, including myself, 45 minutes 50 minutes probably even
optimal. basic design physical exercise approximately 60 minutes.
maybe 60 plus minus 15 minutes well within margins keeping
hormonal health proper not going long making workout short
not beneficial. essentially data tell us order optimize
cardiovascular brain health systems body, want exercise
least five days per week. know seems like lot. certainly lot certain
people. you, compulsive exercisers, might gasp idea taking two
days off. personally find taking two full days off per week actually beneficial
exercise training performance, well pleasant. like rest days.
essentially structure exercise regimen works sake supporting health
going one 3:2 ratio. 12-week period so, maybe
10 12 weeks, three five workouts per week emphasize strength
hypertrophy two emphasize endurance. Then, 10 12 weeks, one
10- 12-week regimen 3:2 ratio prioritizing endurance
work. primarily sorts workouts described endurance episode

work merely maintain strength hypertrophy, not lose strength
hypertrophy created. lot data now supporting fact

threshold optimal, sub-threshold detrimental? complicated theme
don't put structure around it. put little bit structure around it.
already said 60 minutes, 60 minutes plus minus 15 minutes, going
optimal health benefits. structure actual workouts?
Well, need address issue intensity. good rule thumb based
literature, discussed Dr. Andy Galpin prior strength hypertrophy
endurance episodes, literature published quality, peer-reviewed
journals really points fact approximately 80% resistance training
resistance training doesn't go call failure, can't
actually move resistance anymore. 20% can higher intensity
failure type training. Now, respect endurance work, one can build endurance
without log long, long mileage extensive mileage pool running.


forms endurance can build up,
instance, capillary beds within muscles. Building capillary beds within
muscles will allow oxygen utilization within muscles, thereby will increase
endurance muscles, also will improve brain metabolism way
heart functions, cardiovascular function. 80/20 rule less failure
work failure resistance exercise regime can transported translated
endurance exercise portion focusing thing familiar with,
burn running hard cycling hard, experience kind burning
muscles associated lactate system. episode endurance,
pointed burn not lactic acid. Contrary common belief, not lactic
acid. associated lactate metabolism. again, 80% endurance
work not incorporate so-called "burn," 20% work so,
say approximately 20% work, include so-called "burning sensation,"
burning sensation actually triggers activation release certain compounds
molecules glia, brain cell type supports neuron health. actually,
lactate system form fuel brain. increasing interest
generating lactate pushing past lactate threshold small portion, 20% so,
endurance work order support brain health function.
look like protocol? Well, mentioned before, 3:2 ratio. maybe spend
10 weeks 12 weeks focusing mainly endurance, three workouts
per week endurance work, 80% workouts, meaning 80% time
burn threshold, not experiencing burning sensation,
20% it, are. That, based scientific data, support lactate metabolism,
brain health, et cetera, well cardiovascular health oxygen utilization.
forms endurance aware of. two workouts involve
resistance training, again, 80/20 split, 80% work not failure
20% is. maybe 10, 12 weeks, switch, start
emphasizing strength hypertrophy work three workouts endurance
work two workouts. Now, course, will able train six days

first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free
testosterone. make particular binding protein called "sex hormone binding

00:30:48 Protocol 6: Fast (or Fat-Fast) Noon

found best way achieve state fasting. don't eat

days Brazil nuts spoonful three almond butter,
instance, days not that. just not eating anything. drinking
caffeine caffeine source yerba mate, guayusa tea. preferred
sources tend avoid coffee days. Occasionally cup, often
stick teas. drink water much feel need want to. also drink
athletic greens, compatible least fasting. talk
fasting works create heightened state alertness, yet calm brain state. Fasting
increases levels adrenaline, also called "epinephrin" brain body.
levels epinephrin adrenaline increased, learn better, can focus
better. terrific data supporting that. don't want epinephrine, aka adrenaline,

try capture rising phase temperature. now,
emphasizing practices allow optimize level alertness
levels mental focus. Data going back 1990s supports idea physical
movement particular kinds can support brain health brain function
immediate term long term. Now, profound impact field
neuroscience, frankly, also profound impact structure day.
finished work, 90-minute work, force
days, days want to, force sort physical exercise
going supportive brain health brain function organ health bodily
function general. just briefly want touch structure exercise
looks like, structured within day structured across weeks
fact, based scientific data scientific data say best optimal
order promote longevity brain, ability focus, well cardiovascular health
things know exercise supports. Now, various forms
physical activity call exercise, can generally batched two
categories. First strength hypertrophy work. physical movements
designed make stronger and/or make muscles larger. also
endurance work. Physical exercise movements designed allow
work time extend amount time can work kind,
physical mental. two full podcast episodes details
science protocols related topics. episode science
strength hypertrophy, building strength muscle building. included
lot protocols. episode endurance. build one
four types endurance, muscular endurance, anaerobic, aerobic, long-
distance endurance, et cetera. interested specifics protocols,
please see episodes. However, right now just want emphasize data
impact day structure day way can incorporate physical
movement way supports brain health. Basically, finished
cognitive work about, 90-minute work about, form physical exercise


hour. data point fact working hard longer hour
can actually detrimental way raises cortisol. cortisol can
good thing appropriately timed appropriate low levels, don't
want cortisol levels throughout day big spikes cortisol
repeatedly. keeping workouts relatively short can definitely help
certainly training hard, 60 minutes less sufficient.
many people, including myself, 45 minutes 50 minutes probably even
optimal. basic design physical exercise approximately 60 minutes.
maybe 60 plus minus 15 minutes well within margins keeping
hormonal health proper not going long making workout short
not beneficial. essentially data tell us order optimize
cardiovascular brain health systems body, want exercise
least five days per week. know seems like lot. certainly lot certain
people. you, compulsive exercisers, might gasp idea taking two
days off. personally find taking two full days off per week actually beneficial
exercise training performance, well pleasant. like rest days.
essentially structure exercise regimen works sake supporting health
going one 3:2 ratio. 12-week period so, maybe
10 12 weeks, three five workouts per week emphasize strength
hypertrophy two emphasize endurance. Then, 10 12 weeks, one
10- 12-week regimen 3:2 ratio prioritizing endurance
work. primarily sorts workouts described endurance episode
protocols. two days, focusing strength hypertrophy
work merely maintain strength hypertrophy, not lose strength
hypertrophy created. lot data now supporting fact
maintaining muscular health bone health supported resistance training, weight
training various kinds. can also done body weight don't access

muscles body, organs body, also brain. Many
probably heard physical exercise various kinds can support

threshold optimal, sub-threshold detrimental? complicated theme
don't put structure around it. put little bit structure around it.
already said 60 minutes, 60 minutes plus minus 15 minutes, going
optimal health benefits. structure actual workouts?
Well, need address issue intensity. good rule thumb based
literature, discussed Dr. Andy Galpin prior strength hypertrophy
endurance episodes, literature published quality, peer-reviewed
journals really points fact approximately 80% resistance training
resistance training doesn't go call failure, can't
actually move resistance anymore. 20% can higher intensity
failure type training. Now, respect endurance work, one can build endurance
without log long, long mileage extensive mileage pool running.


forms endurance can build up,
instance, capillary beds within muscles. Building capillary beds within
muscles will allow oxygen utilization within muscles, thereby will increase
endurance muscles, also will improve brain metabolism way
heart functions, cardiovascular function. 80/20 rule less failure
work failure resistance exercise regime can transported translated
endurance exercise portion focusing thing familiar with,
burn running hard cycling hard, experience kind burning
muscles associated lactate system. episode endurance,
pointed burn not lactic acid. Contrary common belief, not lactic
acid. associated lactate metabolism. again, 80% endurance
work not incorporate so-called "burn," 20% work so,
say approximately 20% work, include so-called "burning sensation,"
burning sensation actually triggers activation release certain compounds
molecules glia, brain cell type supports neuron health. actually,
lactate system form fuel brain. increasing interest
generating lactate pushing past lactate threshold small portion, 20% so,
endurance work order support brain health function.
look like protocol? Well, mentioned before, 3:2 ratio. maybe spend
10 weeks 12 weeks focusing mainly endurance, three workouts
per week endurance work, 80% workouts, meaning 80% time
burn threshold, not experiencing burning sensation,
20% it, are. That, based scientific data, support lactate metabolism,
brain health, et cetera, well cardiovascular health oxygen utilization.
forms endurance aware of. two workouts involve
resistance training, again, 80/20 split, 80% work not failure
20% is. maybe 10, 12 weeks, switch, start
emphasizing strength hypertrophy work three workouts endurance
work two workouts. Now, course, will able train six days
week compulsively need train seven days week. decide that,
please aware cortisol threshold real thing. me, 3:2 ratio works
perfectly 'cause like two full days off week. take really depends

intelligent way grounded scientific literature relates alertness.
Now, components foods not alertness, mood?
entire episode mood food, clear, based now dozens

01:17:39 Protocol 10: Get Testosterone & Estrogen Ideal Range

basically lot biochemical evidence supports everything just
described. Along lines health wellbeing, remiss didn't mention
hormones. Hormones broad effects body brain. entire month
hormones want hear hormones detail. talked
testosterone optimizing testosterone, estrogen, et cetera. sex steroid
hormones, include testosterone estrogen, which, course, present
varying ratios, men women kids, manufactured
cholesterol. hear cholesterol terrible thing, actually made
cholesterol. don't get sufficient levels cholesterol, can
problematic hormones can problematic brain body
health. without going much detail, just point couple things
that, least blood work subjective experience,
beneficial might want consider. First all, not shy
love butter. will eat packs butter directly. believe people going eat
cheese without cracker, will eat butter without cracker. Butter high cholesterol,
don't eat ton it, least lipid profiles, fine. Butter
cholesterol, precursor sex steroid hormones, men women
need testosterone estrogen order feel good able think. not
want estrogen low testosterone low. eat butter order
ensure get sufficient cholesterol. Butter also things
beneficial, various small fatty acids interesting terms effects
metabolism, et cetera. can look up, benefits butter. again, volume
important can't overdo it. Costello incidentally loves butter well. Along
lines hormones testosterone, get lot questions think
lot online communities sort obsessed testosterone, just want
emphasize that, yes, sufficient levels testosterone vitally important brain
function sufficient levels estrogen will allow brain actually function.
turns estrogen one main ways brain maintains longevity
maintains ability think. seeking optimal testosterone levels
ourselves, testosterone estrogen. many things
discussed now, morning sunlight, exercise, fasting, can support
testosterone estrogen meaningful positive ways. get lot questions


hormone optimization. entire month topic. entire episode
testosterone estrogen optimization. just want briefly highlight two things
relevant, want details, please go see episode.
first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free
testosterone. make particular binding protein called "sex hormone binding
globulin" essentially binds testosterone, prevents free. sounds
like terrible thing, actually good thing allows testosterone
transported various tissues, including brain, can exert various
functions. lower desired levels testosterone much sex
hormone binding globulin, turns 400 milligrams per day something called
"tongkat ali," form ginseng, can actually help increase levels free
testosterone. Many people experience positive subjective effect objective

fasting works create heightened state alertness, yet calm brain state. Fasting
increases levels adrenaline, also called "epinephrin" brain body.

things know exercise supports. Now, various forms
physical activity call exercise, can generally batched two
categories. First strength hypertrophy work. physical movements

repeatedly. keeping workouts relatively short can definitely help
certainly training hard, 60 minutes less sufficient.
many people, including myself, 45 minutes 50 minutes probably even
optimal. basic design physical exercise approximately 60 minutes.
maybe 60 plus minus 15 minutes well within margins keeping
hormonal health proper not going long making workout short
not beneficial. essentially data tell us order optimize
cardiovascular brain health systems body, want exercise
least five days per week. know seems like lot. certainly lot certain
people. you, compulsive exercisers, might gasp idea taking two

exercise training performance, well pleasant. like rest days.
essentially structure exercise regimen works sake supporting health
going one 3:2 ratio. 12-week period so, maybe
10 12 weeks, three five workouts per week emphasize strength

don't put structure around it. put little bit structure around it.
already said 60 minutes, 60 minutes plus minus 15 minutes, going
optimal health benefits. structure actual workouts?
Well, need address issue intensity. good rule thumb based
literature, discussed Dr. Andy Galpin prior strength hypertrophy
endurance episodes, literature published quality, peer-reviewed
journals really points fact approximately 80% resistance training
resistance training doesn't go call failure, can't
actually move resistance anymore. 20% can higher intensity
failure type training. Now, respect endurance work, one can build endurance
without log long, long mileage extensive mileage pool running.


forms endurance can build up,
instance, capillary beds within muscles. Building capillary beds within
muscles will allow oxygen utilization within muscles, thereby will increase
endurance muscles, also will improve brain metabolism way
heart functions, cardiovascular function. 80/20 rule less failure
work failure resistance exercise regime can transported translated
endurance exercise portion focusing thing familiar with,
burn running hard cycling hard, experience kind burning
muscles associated lactate system. episode endurance,
pointed burn not lactic acid. Contrary common belief, not lactic
acid. associated lactate metabolism. again, 80% endurance
work not incorporate so-called "burn," 20% work so,
say approximately 20% work, include so-called "burning sensation,"
burning sensation actually triggers activation release certain compounds
molecules glia, brain cell type supports neuron health. actually,
lactate system form fuel brain. increasing interest
generating lactate pushing past lactate threshold small portion, 20% so,
endurance work order support brain health function.
look like protocol? Well, mentioned before, 3:2 ratio. maybe spend
10 weeks 12 weeks focusing mainly endurance, three workouts
per week endurance work, 80% workouts, meaning 80% time
burn threshold, not experiencing burning sensation,
20% it, are. That, based scientific data, support lactate metabolism,
brain health, et cetera, well cardiovascular health oxygen utilization.
forms endurance aware of. two workouts involve
resistance training, again, 80/20 split, 80% work not failure
20% is. maybe 10, 12 weeks, switch, start
emphasizing strength hypertrophy work three workouts endurance
work two workouts. Now, course, will able train six days
week compulsively need train seven days week. decide that,
please aware cortisol threshold real thing. me, 3:2 ratio works
perfectly 'cause like two full days off week. take really depends

00:17:00 Protocol 3: View Natural Light 10-30min Every Morning

make sure walking done outdoors. might sort duh, many
people get start moving around house, apartment, don't go
anywhere. just walking around inside, will generate optic flow, nothing
like sort optic flow can generate larger environments like doors
environments. can't get outdoors, indoors perfectly fine, not
going magnitude positive effect. Now, order get alertness,
outdoors also want sunlight eyes. know many heard
talk ad nauseam various podcasts, podcast, getting sunlight
eyes first thing morning absolutely vital mental physical health.
perhaps important thing us can order
promote metabolic well-being, promote positive functioning hormone system,
get mental health steering right direction. number reasons
this, get reasons, let just emphasize protocol is.
protocol get outdoors, ideally no sunglasses can safely, even
cloud cover. photons, light information coming cloud cover
coming bright indoor bulb. getting outdoors absolutely
key. long this? going depend brightness
environment. going depend number different factors. Two minutes
minimum, 10 minutes even better, can, 30 minutes
fantastic. Now, bright day or, know, live place bright
sunlight, clear day snowfield, need something like 60 seconds.
people aren't living sorts conditions. getting outside 10-minute
walk 15-minute walk will basically ensure getting adequate stimulation
neurons eye called "melanopsin," intrinsically photosensitive

actually discovered animals, tested humans verified
also exist humans. Not always. Sometimes reverse, tested
first humans, brought animals. indeed, dog, horse,
know, don't know animals there, need this. Now,
hamster nocturnal animal, reason like run wheels night
nocturnal. don't like light. Light actually causes
freeze, right? Actually, aquaria, like fish, always say, "Don't
overfeed fish. kill fish." true, guess fastest way kill


fish is? keep lights 24 hours day also need circadian rhythms,

asking dog okay. Sometimes ask okay. Nonetheless, get

based quality, peer-reviewed data, hydration essential mental performance.
Now, confess don't really like drinking big glasses big jugs water first thing
morning. don't know why, thirst doesn't tend kick first thing. may
different. Either way, force myself, essentially, drink least 16 and, days, 32


ounces water. also put little bit sea salt water. many know,
neurons require ionic flow. means neurons need sodium, need
magnesium, need potassium order function. tend get dehydrated

little bit sea salt. much sea salt? really want get detailed, suppose
half teaspoon.

00:28:00 Protocol 5: Delay Caffeine 90-120m Waking

not much, do. drink less room temperature. find
drinking really cold water first thing day kind like cramps insides,
don't that. point, start thinking fantasizing craving
caffeine, don't drink caffeine yet. purposely delay caffeine intake 90
minutes 120 minutes wake up. course, know wake 'cause wrote
down, although pretty easy commit memory. reason delay caffeine
one factors induces sense sleepiness buildup
adenosine or, people call it, adenosine system. buildup adenosine
accumulates longer awake. wake morning,
wake morning, adenosine levels likely low. However,
caffeine adenosine blocker. actually competitive antagonist
aficionados. sort parks receptor adenosine normally park
prevents adenosine acting receptor. feel alert,
essentially blocking effect sleepiness factor create
called "adenosine." reason delaying caffeine intake 90 minutes two hours
waking want make sure don't late afternoon even early
afternoon crash caffeine. One best ways ensure caffeine crash
drink bunch caffeine, block adenosine receptors, early late
afternoon, caffeine starts wear off gets dislodged receptors,
lower level adenosine able create greater level sleepiness. took years
figure out. used wake think, "Oh, don't want drink caffeine
close bedtime, going start drinking caffeine really early." let cortisol
naturally come morning. avoid drinking caffeine 90 minutes two
hours waking. that, find don't experience afternoon crash.


least don't experience crash unless something foolish, like ingest far
much food lunch stay night night before. provided don't anything
foolish like that, delaying caffeine 90 minutes two hours optimizes relationship
adenosine wakefulness sleepiness way really provides nice,
consistent arc energy throughout day brings energy headed
toward sleep falling asleep. primary objective early day get
mode focused, yet alert can get work done.

00:30:48 Protocol 6: Fast (or Fat-Fast) Noon

found best way achieve state fasting. don't eat
anything 11:00 12:00 noon. not absolutely religious it.
days Brazil nuts spoonful three almond butter,
instance, days not that. just not eating anything. drinking
caffeine caffeine source yerba mate, guayusa tea. preferred
sources tend avoid coffee days. Occasionally cup, often
stick teas. drink water much feel need want to. also drink
athletic greens, compatible least fasting. talk
fasting works create heightened state alertness, yet calm brain state. Fasting
increases levels adrenaline, also called "epinephrin" brain body.
levels epinephrin adrenaline increased, learn better, can focus
better. terrific data supporting that. don't want epinephrine, aka adrenaline,
high. feels like stress panic. get jittery, can't focus.
optimal range, adrenaline really provides heightened sense focus ability
encode, meaning bring in, retain, remember information. since job
mainly cerebral one writing grants working papers, et cetera, fast
early part day. mentioned ingesting things like guayusa yerba mate or,
case, athletic greens. Many people ask, fact whole community
discussion boards, et cetera,

00:32:30 Actually Breaks Fast & Doesn’t?

YouTube comments internet, breaks fast doesn't.
fact matter going highly individual going depend


sensitive blood sugar. accurately, going depend things like
insulin sensitivity. instance, somebody gets morning,
hydrates, goes six-mile run, probably eat jar almond butter
still called fat-fasted. insulin levels will still low even
though large volume almond butter, even Costello, large
number calories comes source doesn't increase blood sugar much
insulin much. Now, not suggesting that, just described
vastly different situation somebody ate last meal 2:00 AM,
meal essentially feast. person, fasting 10:00 11:00 AM,
blood sugar might still actually pretty high even lowish might eat one
almond bump fasting. get idea. going depend
recent eating history, blood sugar history, glycogen stores, et cetera.
anyone tells breaks fast doesn't, kind silly. one
grain sugar break fast? No. entire tablespoon sugar break fast?
Yes. get big blip blood sugar insulin that. However, long
lasts, long breaks fast will depend glycogen-depleted
number factors. me, just keep fairly simple: ingest water, caffeine
yerba mate guayusa, drink athletic greens lemon juice
it. constitutes fasting. days things.
days none things. Although days, say 355
days year, ingesting water, caffeine, athletic greens period

00:34:30 Fat Loss & Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP1), Yerba Mate, Guayusa Tea

fasting early day, period time work. One
interesting fact yerba mate guayusa teas increase release
something called "GLP-1." GLP-1 related glucagon. Glucagon hormone
can sort think opposite insulin blood sugar. complex
that, GLP-1 couple positive properties. One increases lipolysis
mobilization body fat stores, burning fat. fact, now number
clinical trials achieving good success drugs
available prescription mimic GLP-1 used treat, quite
successfully, certain types diabetes obesity. Now, not diabetic, trying
shed ton body fat, figure long fasting long like yerba


mate guayusa, do, delicious, tell type use
moment, might well increase GLP-1 probably not good getting
cardio work. nonetheless, fasted, increasing GLP-1
system, going alert caffeine, adrenaline, et cetera, going
burning body fat work. me, just efficient, biochemically
rational, say grounded quality biochemistry sort approach. Yerba mate
comes lot different forms. lot different brands there, et cetera.
don't relationship whatsoever business sense brands.
smoky. I, just something genetic makeup,
don't know, maybe sort Y chromosome-associated lesion early life,
don't like smoky flavors. not Gouda cheese guy. don't like smoky stuff.
may love it, tend avoid smoky-tasting mates. Instead, particular brand
just found internet called Anna Park. don't know Anna, don't know
park, certainly don't know Anna Park is, me, best-
tasting yerba mate. Again, don't relationship them, affordable
context yerba mate one use. mention along lines
affordability GLP-1 nice feature yerba mate put
filter metal strainer pour hot water it, drink it, keep leaves.
yerba mate leaves can used again. seems GLP-1
stimulating aspects yerba mate actually enhanced subsequent pour overs.
something interesting teas tea aficionado friends tell

really want run experiment. say can use day two

00:52:07 Protocol 8: Optimal Exercise; 3:2 Ratio

try capture rising phase temperature. now,
emphasizing practices allow optimize level alertness

immediate term long term. Now, profound impact field
neuroscience, frankly, also profound impact structure day.
finished work, 90-minute work, force

going supportive brain health brain function organ health bodily
function general. just briefly want touch structure exercise
looks like, structured within day structured across weeks
fact, based scientific data scientific data say best optimal
order promote longevity brain, ability focus, well cardiovascular health
things know exercise supports. Now, various forms
physical activity call exercise, can generally batched two
categories. First strength hypertrophy work. physical movements
designed make stronger and/or make muscles larger. also
endurance work. Physical exercise movements designed allow
work time extend amount time can work kind,
physical mental. two full podcast episodes details
science protocols related topics. episode science
strength hypertrophy, building strength muscle building. included
lot protocols. episode endurance. build one
four types endurance, muscular endurance, anaerobic, aerobic, long-

please see episodes. However, right now just want emphasize data
impact day structure day way can incorporate physical
movement way supports brain health. Basically, finished
cognitive work about, 90-minute work about, form physical exercise


hour. data point fact working hard longer hour
can actually detrimental way raises cortisol. cortisol can
good thing appropriately timed appropriate low levels, don't
want cortisol levels throughout day big spikes cortisol
repeatedly. keeping workouts relatively short can definitely help
certainly training hard, 60 minutes less sufficient.
many people, including myself, 45 minutes 50 minutes probably even
optimal. basic design physical exercise approximately 60 minutes.
maybe 60 plus minus 15 minutes well within margins keeping
hormonal health proper not going long making workout short
not beneficial. essentially data tell us order optimize
cardiovascular brain health systems body, want exercise
least five days per week. know seems like lot. certainly lot certain
people. you, compulsive exercisers, might gasp idea taking two
days off. personally find taking two full days off per week actually beneficial
exercise training performance, well pleasant. like rest days.
essentially structure exercise regimen works sake supporting health
going one 3:2 ratio. 12-week period so, maybe
10 12 weeks, three five workouts per week emphasize strength
hypertrophy two emphasize endurance. Then, 10 12 weeks, one
10- 12-week regimen 3:2 ratio prioritizing endurance
work. primarily sorts workouts described endurance episode
protocols. two days, focusing strength hypertrophy
work merely maintain strength hypertrophy, not lose strength
hypertrophy created. lot data now supporting fact
maintaining muscular health bone health supported resistance training, weight
training various kinds. can also done body weight don't access

muscles body, organs body, also brain. Many
probably heard physical exercise various kinds can support
production new neurons brain. Frankly, data specific research
animals. far know, increases neuron number not supported exercise
humans. little bit data supports maybe neurons might get

workout, get one hour exercise five days per week ways
supports general health. now hundreds studies supporting
fact endurance work strength training hypertrophy training done
combination, meaning not necessarily workout, done across week
immensely beneficial production things like brain-derived neurotrophic factor,
limiting inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines
like IL-10, provided exercise proper duration not intense
actually creating damage various systems body. Now,
threshold optimal, sub-threshold detrimental? complicated theme
don't put structure around it. put little bit structure around it.
already said 60 minutes, 60 minutes plus minus 15 minutes, going
optimal health benefits. structure actual workouts?
Well, need address issue intensity. good rule thumb based
literature, discussed Dr. Andy Galpin prior strength hypertrophy
endurance episodes, literature published quality, peer-reviewed
journals really points fact approximately 80% resistance training
resistance training doesn't go call failure, can't
actually move resistance anymore. 20% can higher intensity
failure type training. Now, respect endurance work, one can build endurance
without log long, long mileage extensive mileage pool running.


forms endurance can build up,
instance, capillary beds within muscles. Building capillary beds within
muscles will allow oxygen utilization within muscles, thereby will increase
endurance muscles, also will improve brain metabolism way
heart functions, cardiovascular function. 80/20 rule less failure
work failure resistance exercise regime can transported translated
endurance exercise portion focusing thing familiar with,
burn running hard cycling hard, experience kind burning
muscles associated lactate system. episode endurance,
pointed burn not lactic acid. Contrary common belief, not lactic
acid. associated lactate metabolism. again, 80% endurance
work not incorporate so-called "burn," 20% work so,
say approximately 20% work, include so-called "burning sensation,"
burning sensation actually triggers activation release certain compounds
molecules glia, brain cell type supports neuron health. actually,
lactate system form fuel brain. increasing interest
generating lactate pushing past lactate threshold small portion, 20% so,
endurance work order support brain health function.
look like protocol? Well, mentioned before, 3:2 ratio. maybe spend
10 weeks 12 weeks focusing mainly endurance, three workouts
per week endurance work, 80% workouts, meaning 80% time
burn threshold, not experiencing burning sensation,
20% it, are. That, based scientific data, support lactate metabolism,
brain health, et cetera, well cardiovascular health oxygen utilization.
forms endurance aware of. two workouts involve
resistance training, again, 80/20 split, 80% work not failure
20% is. maybe 10, 12 weeks, switch, start
emphasizing strength hypertrophy work three workouts endurance
work two workouts. Now, course, will able train six days
week compulsively need train seven days week. decide that,
please aware cortisol threshold real thing. me, 3:2 ratio works
perfectly 'cause like two full days off week. take really depends

drink bunch caffeine, block adenosine receptors, early late
afternoon, caffeine starts wear off gets dislodged receptors,
lower level adenosine able create greater level sleepiness. took years

fasting works create heightened state alertness, yet calm brain state. Fasting
increases levels adrenaline, also called "epinephrin" brain body.

hydrates, goes six-mile run, probably eat jar almond butter
still called fat-fasted. insulin levels will still low even
though large volume almond butter, even Costello, large

insulin much. Now, not suggesting that, just described
vastly different situation somebody ate last meal 2:00 AM,

things know exercise supports. Now, various forms
physical activity call exercise, can generally batched two

many people, including myself, 45 minutes 50 minutes probably even

Well, need address issue intensity. good rule thumb based

relevant, want details, please go see episode.
first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free
testosterone. make particular binding protein called "sex hormone binding

like terrible thing, actually good thing allows testosterone
transported various tissues, including brain, can exert various
functions. lower desired levels testosterone much sex
hormone binding globulin, turns 400 milligrams per day something called
"tongkat ali," form ginseng, can actually help increase levels free
testosterone. Many people experience positive subjective effect objective
affects well, meaning increases free testosterone blood analysis.

not much, do. drink less room temperature. find
drinking really cold water first thing day kind like cramps insides,
don't that. point, start thinking fantasizing craving
caffeine, don't drink caffeine yet. purposely delay caffeine intake 90
minutes 120 minutes wake up. course, know wake 'cause wrote
down, although pretty easy commit memory. reason delay caffeine
one factors induces sense sleepiness buildup
adenosine or, people call it, adenosine system. buildup adenosine
accumulates longer awake. wake morning,
wake morning, adenosine levels likely low. However,
caffeine adenosine blocker. actually competitive antagonist
aficionados. sort parks receptor adenosine normally park
prevents adenosine acting receptor. feel alert,
essentially blocking effect sleepiness factor create
called "adenosine." reason delaying caffeine intake 90 minutes two hours
waking want make sure don't late afternoon even early
afternoon crash caffeine. One best ways ensure caffeine crash
drink bunch caffeine, block adenosine receptors, early late
afternoon, caffeine starts wear off gets dislodged receptors,
lower level adenosine able create greater level sleepiness. took years
figure out. used wake think, "Oh, don't want drink caffeine
close bedtime, going start drinking caffeine really early." let cortisol
naturally come morning. avoid drinking caffeine 90 minutes two
hours waking. that, find don't experience afternoon crash.


least don't experience crash unless something foolish, like ingest far
much food lunch stay night night before. provided don't anything
foolish like that, delaying caffeine 90 minutes two hours optimizes relationship
adenosine wakefulness sleepiness way really provides nice,
consistent arc energy throughout day brings energy headed
toward sleep falling asleep. primary objective early day get
mode focused, yet alert can get work done.

00:30:48 Protocol 6: Fast (or Fat-Fast) Noon

found best way achieve state fasting. don't eat
anything 11:00 12:00 noon. not absolutely religious it.
days Brazil nuts spoonful three almond butter,
instance, days not that. just not eating anything. drinking
caffeine caffeine source yerba mate, guayusa tea. preferred
sources tend avoid coffee days. Occasionally cup, often
stick teas. drink water much feel need want to. also drink
athletic greens, compatible least fasting. talk
fasting works create heightened state alertness, yet calm brain state. Fasting
increases levels adrenaline, also called "epinephrin" brain body.
levels epinephrin adrenaline increased, learn better, can focus
better. terrific data supporting that. don't want epinephrine, aka adrenaline,
high. feels like stress panic. get jittery, can't focus.
optimal range, adrenaline really provides heightened sense focus ability
encode, meaning bring in, retain, remember information. since job
mainly cerebral one writing grants working papers, et cetera, fast
early part day. mentioned ingesting things like guayusa yerba mate or,
case, athletic greens. Many people ask, fact whole community
discussion boards, et cetera,

00:32:30 Actually Breaks Fast & Doesn’t?

YouTube comments internet, breaks fast doesn't.
fact matter going highly individual going depend


sensitive blood sugar. accurately, going depend things like
insulin sensitivity. instance, somebody gets morning,
hydrates, goes six-mile run, probably eat jar almond butter
still called fat-fasted. insulin levels will still low even
though large volume almond butter, even Costello, large
number calories comes source doesn't increase blood sugar much
insulin much. Now, not suggesting that, just described
vastly different situation somebody ate last meal 2:00 AM,
meal essentially feast. person, fasting 10:00 11:00 AM,
blood sugar might still actually pretty high even lowish might eat one
almond bump fasting. get idea. going depend
recent eating history, blood sugar history, glycogen stores, et cetera.
anyone tells breaks fast doesn't, kind silly. one
grain sugar break fast? No. entire tablespoon sugar break fast?
Yes. get big blip blood sugar insulin that. However, long
lasts, long breaks fast will depend glycogen-depleted
number factors. me, just keep fairly simple: ingest water, caffeine

days year, ingesting water, caffeine, athletic greens period

00:34:30 Fat Loss & Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP1), Yerba Mate, Guayusa Tea

fasting early day, period time work. One
interesting fact yerba mate guayusa teas increase release
something called "GLP-1." GLP-1 related glucagon. Glucagon hormone
can sort think opposite insulin blood sugar. complex
that, GLP-1 couple positive properties. One increases lipolysis
mobilization body fat stores, burning fat. fact, now number
clinical trials achieving good success drugs
available prescription mimic GLP-1 used treat, quite
successfully, certain types diabetes obesity. Now, not diabetic, trying
shed ton body fat, figure long fasting long like yerba


mate guayusa, do, delicious, tell type use
moment, might well increase GLP-1 probably not good getting
cardio work. nonetheless, fasted, increasing GLP-1
system, going alert caffeine, adrenaline, et cetera, going
burning body fat work. me, just efficient, biochemically
rational, say grounded quality biochemistry sort approach. Yerba mate
comes lot different forms. lot different brands there, et cetera.
don't relationship whatsoever business sense brands.
smoky. I, just something genetic makeup,
don't know, maybe sort Y chromosome-associated lesion early life,
don't like smoky flavors. not Gouda cheese guy. don't like smoky stuff.
may love it, tend avoid smoky-tasting mates. Instead, particular brand
just found internet called Anna Park. don't know Anna, don't know
park, certainly don't know Anna Park is, me, best-
tasting yerba mate. Again, don't relationship them, affordable
context yerba mate one use. mention along lines
affordability GLP-1 nice feature yerba mate put
filter metal strainer pour hot water it, drink it, keep leaves.
yerba mate leaves can used again. seems GLP-1
stimulating aspects yerba mate actually enhanced subsequent pour overs.
something interesting teas tea aficionado friends tell
allows tea release beneficial compounds reusing tea

really want run experiment. say can use day two

without log long, long mileage extensive mileage pool running.


forms endurance can build up,
instance, capillary beds within muscles. Building capillary beds within
muscles will allow oxygen utilization within muscles, thereby will increase
endurance muscles, also will improve brain metabolism way

say approximately 20% work, include so-called "burning sensation,"
burning sensation actually triggers activation release certain compounds

relevant, want details, please go see episode.
first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free
testosterone. make particular binding protein called "sex hormone binding

like terrible thing, actually good thing allows testosterone
transported various tissues, including brain, can exert various
functions. lower desired levels testosterone much sex
hormone binding globulin, turns 400 milligrams per day something called
"tongkat ali," form ginseng, can actually help increase levels free
testosterone. Many people experience positive subjective effect objective

fasting works create heightened state alertness, yet calm brain state. Fasting
increases levels adrenaline, also called "epinephrin" brain body.

insulin sensitivity. instance, somebody gets morning,
hydrates, goes six-mile run, probably eat jar almond butter
still called fat-fasted. insulin levels will still low even
though large volume almond butter, even Costello, large
number calories comes source doesn't increase blood sugar much
insulin much. Now, not suggesting that, just described
vastly different situation somebody ate last meal 2:00 AM,

00:34:30 Fat Loss & Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP1), Yerba Mate, Guayusa Tea

fasting early day, period time work. One
interesting fact yerba mate guayusa teas increase release
something called "GLP-1." GLP-1 related glucagon. Glucagon hormone
can sort think opposite insulin blood sugar. complex
that, GLP-1 couple positive properties. One increases lipolysis
mobilization body fat stores, burning fat. fact, now number
clinical trials achieving good success drugs

successfully, certain types diabetes obesity. Now, not diabetic, trying
shed ton body fat, figure long fasting long like yerba


mate guayusa, do, delicious, tell type use

may love it, tend avoid smoky-tasting mates. Instead, particular brand
just found internet called Anna Park. don't know Anna, don't know
park, certainly don't know Anna Park is, me, best-
tasting yerba mate. Again, don't relationship them, affordable
context yerba mate one use. mention along lines

things know exercise supports. Now, various forms
physical activity call exercise, can generally batched two

many people, including myself, 45 minutes 50 minutes probably even
optimal. basic design physical exercise approximately 60 minutes.
maybe 60 plus minus 15 minutes well within margins keeping

Well, need address issue intensity. good rule thumb based

testosterone estrogen optimization. just want briefly highlight two things
relevant, want details, please go see episode.
first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free
testosterone. make particular binding protein called "sex hormone binding

like terrible thing, actually good thing allows testosterone
transported various tissues, including brain, can exert various
functions. lower desired levels testosterone much sex
hormone binding globulin, turns 400 milligrams per day something called
"tongkat ali," form ginseng, can actually help increase levels free
testosterone. Many people experience positive subjective effect objective
affects well, meaning increases free testosterone blood analysis.

caffeine, don't drink caffeine yet. purposely delay caffeine intake 90
minutes 120 minutes wake up. course, know wake 'cause wrote
down, although pretty easy commit memory. reason delay caffeine

drink bunch caffeine, block adenosine receptors, early late
afternoon, caffeine starts wear off gets dislodged receptors,
lower level adenosine able create greater level sleepiness. took years

00:30:48 Protocol 6: Fast (or Fat-Fast) Noon

found best way achieve state fasting. don't eat

days Brazil nuts spoonful three almond butter,
instance, days not that. just not eating anything. drinking
caffeine caffeine source yerba mate, guayusa tea. preferred
sources tend avoid coffee days. Occasionally cup, often
stick teas. drink water much feel need want to. also drink
athletic greens, compatible least fasting. talk
fasting works create heightened state alertness, yet calm brain state. Fasting
increases levels adrenaline, also called "epinephrin" brain body.
levels epinephrin adrenaline increased, learn better, can focus
better. terrific data supporting that. don't want epinephrine, aka adrenaline,
high. feels like stress panic. get jittery, can't focus.
optimal range, adrenaline really provides heightened sense focus ability
encode, meaning bring in, retain, remember information. since job

00:32:30 Actually Breaks Fast & Doesn’t?

YouTube comments internet, breaks fast doesn't.
fact matter going highly individual going depend


sensitive blood sugar. accurately, going depend things like
insulin sensitivity. instance, somebody gets morning,
hydrates, goes six-mile run, probably eat jar almond butter
still called fat-fasted. insulin levels will still low even
though large volume almond butter, even Costello, large
number calories comes source doesn't increase blood sugar much
insulin much. Now, not suggesting that, just described
vastly different situation somebody ate last meal 2:00 AM,
meal essentially feast. person, fasting 10:00 11:00 AM,
blood sugar might still actually pretty high even lowish might eat one
almond bump fasting. get idea. going depend

Yes. get big blip blood sugar insulin that. However, long

00:34:30 Fat Loss & Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP1), Yerba Mate, Guayusa Tea

fasting early day, period time work. One
interesting fact yerba mate guayusa teas increase release
something called "GLP-1." GLP-1 related glucagon. Glucagon hormone
can sort think opposite insulin blood sugar. complex
that, GLP-1 couple positive properties. One increases lipolysis
mobilization body fat stores, burning fat. fact, now number
clinical trials achieving good success drugs
available prescription mimic GLP-1 used treat, quite
successfully, certain types diabetes obesity. Now, not diabetic, trying
shed ton body fat, figure long fasting long like yerba


mate guayusa, do, delicious, tell type use
moment, might well increase GLP-1 probably not good getting
cardio work. nonetheless, fasted, increasing GLP-1
system, going alert caffeine, adrenaline, et cetera, going
burning body fat work. me, just efficient, biochemically
rational, say grounded quality biochemistry sort approach. Yerba mate
comes lot different forms. lot different brands there, et cetera.
don't relationship whatsoever business sense brands.
smoky. I, just something genetic makeup,
don't know, maybe sort Y chromosome-associated lesion early life,
don't like smoky flavors. not Gouda cheese guy. don't like smoky stuff.
may love it, tend avoid smoky-tasting mates. Instead, particular brand
just found internet called Anna Park. don't know Anna, don't know
park, certainly don't know Anna Park is, me, best-
tasting yerba mate. Again, don't relationship them, affordable
context yerba mate one use. mention along lines
affordability GLP-1 nice feature yerba mate put
filter metal strainer pour hot water it, drink it, keep leaves.
yerba mate leaves can used again. seems GLP-1
stimulating aspects yerba mate actually enhanced subsequent pour overs.
something interesting teas tea aficionado friends tell
allows tea release beneficial compounds reusing tea

really want run experiment. say can use day two

00:52:07 Protocol 8: Optimal Exercise; 3:2 Ratio

try capture rising phase temperature. now,
emphasizing practices allow optimize level alertness
levels mental focus. Data going back 1990s supports idea physical
movement particular kinds can support brain health brain function
immediate term long term. Now, profound impact field
neuroscience, frankly, also profound impact structure day.
finished work, 90-minute work, force

going supportive brain health brain function organ health bodily

looks like, structured within day structured across weeks
fact, based scientific data scientific data say best optimal
order promote longevity brain, ability focus, well cardiovascular health
things know exercise supports. Now, various forms
physical activity call exercise, can generally batched two
categories. First strength hypertrophy work. physical movements
designed make stronger and/or make muscles larger. also
endurance work. Physical exercise movements designed allow
work time extend amount time can work kind,
physical mental. two full podcast episodes details
science protocols related topics. episode science
strength hypertrophy, building strength muscle building. included
lot protocols. episode endurance. build one
four types endurance, muscular endurance, anaerobic, aerobic, long-

please see episodes. However, right now just want emphasize data
impact day structure day way can incorporate physical
movement way supports brain health. Basically, finished
cognitive work about, 90-minute work about, form physical exercise


hour. data point fact working hard longer hour
can actually detrimental way raises cortisol. cortisol can
good thing appropriately timed appropriate low levels, don't
want cortisol levels throughout day big spikes cortisol
repeatedly. keeping workouts relatively short can definitely help
certainly training hard, 60 minutes less sufficient.
many people, including myself, 45 minutes 50 minutes probably even
optimal. basic design physical exercise approximately 60 minutes.
maybe 60 plus minus 15 minutes well within margins keeping
hormonal health proper not going long making workout short
not beneficial. essentially data tell us order optimize
cardiovascular brain health systems body, want exercise
least five days per week. know seems like lot. certainly lot certain
people. you, compulsive exercisers, might gasp idea taking two
days off. personally find taking two full days off per week actually beneficial
exercise training performance, well pleasant. like rest days.
essentially structure exercise regimen works sake supporting health
going one 3:2 ratio. 12-week period so, maybe
10 12 weeks, three five workouts per week emphasize strength
hypertrophy two emphasize endurance. Then, 10 12 weeks, one
10- 12-week regimen 3:2 ratio prioritizing endurance
work. primarily sorts workouts described endurance episode
protocols. two days, focusing strength hypertrophy
work merely maintain strength hypertrophy, not lose strength
hypertrophy created. lot data now supporting fact

probably heard physical exercise various kinds can support

fact endurance work strength training hypertrophy training done
combination, meaning not necessarily workout, done across week
immensely beneficial production things like brain-derived neurotrophic factor,
limiting inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines
like IL-10, provided exercise proper duration not intense
actually creating damage various systems body. Now,
threshold optimal, sub-threshold detrimental? complicated theme
don't put structure around it. put little bit structure around it.
already said 60 minutes, 60 minutes plus minus 15 minutes, going
optimal health benefits. structure actual workouts?
Well, need address issue intensity. good rule thumb based
literature, discussed Dr. Andy Galpin prior strength hypertrophy
endurance episodes, literature published quality, peer-reviewed
journals really points fact approximately 80% resistance training
resistance training doesn't go call failure, can't
actually move resistance anymore. 20% can higher intensity
failure type training. Now, respect endurance work, one can build endurance
without log long, long mileage extensive mileage pool running.


forms endurance can build up,
instance, capillary beds within muscles. Building capillary beds within
muscles will allow oxygen utilization within muscles, thereby will increase
endurance muscles, also will improve brain metabolism way
heart functions, cardiovascular function. 80/20 rule less failure
work failure resistance exercise regime can transported translated
endurance exercise portion focusing thing familiar with,
burn running hard cycling hard, experience kind burning
muscles associated lactate system. episode endurance,
pointed burn not lactic acid. Contrary common belief, not lactic
acid. associated lactate metabolism. again, 80% endurance
work not incorporate so-called "burn," 20% work so,
say approximately 20% work, include so-called "burning sensation,"
burning sensation actually triggers activation release certain compounds
molecules glia, brain cell type supports neuron health. actually,
lactate system form fuel brain. increasing interest
generating lactate pushing past lactate threshold small portion, 20% so,
endurance work order support brain health function.
look like protocol? Well, mentioned before, 3:2 ratio. maybe spend
10 weeks 12 weeks focusing mainly endurance, three workouts
per week endurance work, 80% workouts, meaning 80% time
burn threshold, not experiencing burning sensation,
20% it, are. That, based scientific data, support lactate metabolism,
brain health, et cetera, well cardiovascular health oxygen utilization.
forms endurance aware of. two workouts involve
resistance training, again, 80/20 split, 80% work not failure
20% is. maybe 10, 12 weeks, switch, start
emphasizing strength hypertrophy work three workouts endurance
work two workouts. Now, course, will able train six days
week compulsively need train seven days week. decide that,
please aware cortisol threshold real thing. me, 3:2 ratio works
perfectly 'cause like two full days off week. take really depends

relevant, want details, please go see episode.
first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free

functions. lower desired levels testosterone much sex
hormone binding globulin, turns 400 milligrams per day something called
"tongkat ali," form ginseng, can actually help increase levels free
testosterone. Many people experience positive subjective effect objective

fact, based scientific data scientific data say best optimal

things know exercise supports. Now, various forms
physical activity call exercise, can generally batched two
categories. First strength hypertrophy work. physical movements

certainly training hard, 60 minutes less sufficient.
many people, including myself, 45 minutes 50 minutes probably even
optimal. basic design physical exercise approximately 60 minutes.
maybe 60 plus minus 15 minutes well within margins keeping
hormonal health proper not going long making workout short
not beneficial. essentially data tell us order optimize
cardiovascular brain health systems body, want exercise
least five days per week. know seems like lot. certainly lot certain
people. you, compulsive exercisers, might gasp idea taking two
days off. personally find taking two full days off per week actually beneficial
exercise training performance, well pleasant. like rest days.
essentially structure exercise regimen works sake supporting health
going one 3:2 ratio. 12-week period so, maybe
10 12 weeks, three five workouts per week emphasize strength

don't put structure around it. put little bit structure around it.
already said 60 minutes, 60 minutes plus minus 15 minutes, going
optimal health benefits. structure actual workouts?
Well, need address issue intensity. good rule thumb based
literature, discussed Dr. Andy Galpin prior strength hypertrophy
endurance episodes, literature published quality, peer-reviewed
journals really points fact approximately 80% resistance training
resistance training doesn't go call failure, can't
actually move resistance anymore. 20% can higher intensity
failure type training. Now, respect endurance work, one can build endurance
without log long, long mileage extensive mileage pool running.


forms endurance can build up,
instance, capillary beds within muscles. Building capillary beds within
muscles will allow oxygen utilization within muscles, thereby will increase
endurance muscles, also will improve brain metabolism way
heart functions, cardiovascular function. 80/20 rule less failure
work failure resistance exercise regime can transported translated
endurance exercise portion focusing thing familiar with,
burn running hard cycling hard, experience kind burning
muscles associated lactate system. episode endurance,
pointed burn not lactic acid. Contrary common belief, not lactic
acid. associated lactate metabolism. again, 80% endurance
work not incorporate so-called "burn," 20% work so,
say approximately 20% work, include so-called "burning sensation,"
burning sensation actually triggers activation release certain compounds
molecules glia, brain cell type supports neuron health. actually,
lactate system form fuel brain. increasing interest
generating lactate pushing past lactate threshold small portion, 20% so,
endurance work order support brain health function.
look like protocol? Well, mentioned before, 3:2 ratio. maybe spend
10 weeks 12 weeks focusing mainly endurance, three workouts
per week endurance work, 80% workouts, meaning 80% time
burn threshold, not experiencing burning sensation,
20% it, are. That, based scientific data, support lactate metabolism,
brain health, et cetera, well cardiovascular health oxygen utilization.
forms endurance aware of. two workouts involve
resistance training, again, 80/20 split, 80% work not failure
20% is. maybe 10, 12 weeks, switch, start
emphasizing strength hypertrophy work three workouts endurance
work two workouts. Now, course, will able train six days
week compulsively need train seven days week. decide that,

can reasonably sure, want underscore reasonably, can
reasonably sure best work going done anywhere four six hours


temperature minimum. me, tend wake around 6:30 AM,
means temperature minimum 4:30 AM. can add five hours that.
means 90 minute work fall 9:30 fairly optimized.
10:30 AM, 8:30 AM. Somewhere there, right?
can't say exactly six hours temperature minimum. will find
it, however. precise best time 90-minute work about.
Whether not five six hours temperature minimum going vary
person person. know this? know relationship
temperature minimum focus cognition? Well, temperature minimum defines

00:52:07 Protocol 8: Optimal Exercise; 3:2 Ratio

try capture rising phase temperature. now,
emphasizing practices allow optimize level alertness
levels mental focus. Data going back 1990s supports idea physical
movement particular kinds can support brain health brain function
immediate term long term. Now, profound impact field
neuroscience, frankly, also profound impact structure day.
finished work, 90-minute work, force
days, days want to, force sort physical exercise
going supportive brain health brain function organ health bodily
function general. just briefly want touch structure exercise
looks like, structured within day structured across weeks
fact, based scientific data scientific data say best optimal
order promote longevity brain, ability focus, well cardiovascular health
things know exercise supports. Now, various forms
physical activity call exercise, can generally batched two
categories. First strength hypertrophy work. physical movements
designed make stronger and/or make muscles larger. also
endurance work. Physical exercise movements designed allow
work time extend amount time can work kind,
physical mental. two full podcast episodes details
science protocols related topics. episode science
strength hypertrophy, building strength muscle building. included
lot protocols. episode endurance. build one
four types endurance, muscular endurance, anaerobic, aerobic, long-
distance endurance, et cetera. interested specifics protocols,
please see episodes. However, right now just want emphasize data
impact day structure day way can incorporate physical
movement way supports brain health. Basically, finished
cognitive work about, 90-minute work about, form physical exercise


hour. data point fact working hard longer hour
can actually detrimental way raises cortisol. cortisol can
good thing appropriately timed appropriate low levels, don't
want cortisol levels throughout day big spikes cortisol
repeatedly. keeping workouts relatively short can definitely help
certainly training hard, 60 minutes less sufficient.
many people, including myself, 45 minutes 50 minutes probably even
optimal. basic design physical exercise approximately 60 minutes.
maybe 60 plus minus 15 minutes well within margins keeping
hormonal health proper not going long making workout short
not beneficial. essentially data tell us order optimize
cardiovascular brain health systems body, want exercise
least five days per week. know seems like lot. certainly lot certain
people. you, compulsive exercisers, might gasp idea taking two
days off. personally find taking two full days off per week actually beneficial
exercise training performance, well pleasant. like rest days.
essentially structure exercise regimen works sake supporting health
going one 3:2 ratio. 12-week period so, maybe
10 12 weeks, three five workouts per week emphasize strength
hypertrophy two emphasize endurance. Then, 10 12 weeks, one
10- 12-week regimen 3:2 ratio prioritizing endurance
work. primarily sorts workouts described endurance episode
protocols. two days, focusing strength hypertrophy
work merely maintain strength hypertrophy, not lose strength
hypertrophy created. lot data now supporting fact
maintaining muscular health bone health supported resistance training, weight
training various kinds. can also done body weight don't access
equipment. And, course, cardiovascular endurance work beneficial
muscles body, organs body, also brain. Many
probably heard physical exercise various kinds can support
production new neurons brain. Frankly, data specific research
animals. far know, increases neuron number not supported exercise
humans. little bit data supports maybe neurons might get
created running weightlifting things sort human beings, still


host reasons hour per day one physical

workout, get one hour exercise five days per week ways
supports general health. now hundreds studies supporting
fact endurance work strength training hypertrophy training done
combination, meaning not necessarily workout, done across week
immensely beneficial production things like brain-derived neurotrophic factor,
limiting inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines
like IL-10, provided exercise proper duration not intense
actually creating damage various systems body. Now,
threshold optimal, sub-threshold detrimental? complicated theme
don't put structure around it. put little bit structure around it.
already said 60 minutes, 60 minutes plus minus 15 minutes, going
optimal health benefits. structure actual workouts?
Well, need address issue intensity. good rule thumb based
literature, discussed Dr. Andy Galpin prior strength hypertrophy
endurance episodes, literature published quality, peer-reviewed
journals really points fact approximately 80% resistance training
resistance training doesn't go call failure, can't
actually move resistance anymore. 20% can higher intensity
failure type training. Now, respect endurance work, one can build endurance
without log long, long mileage extensive mileage pool running.


forms endurance can build up,
instance, capillary beds within muscles. Building capillary beds within
muscles will allow oxygen utilization within muscles, thereby will increase
endurance muscles, also will improve brain metabolism way
heart functions, cardiovascular function. 80/20 rule less failure
work failure resistance exercise regime can transported translated
endurance exercise portion focusing thing familiar with,
burn running hard cycling hard, experience kind burning
muscles associated lactate system. episode endurance,
pointed burn not lactic acid. Contrary common belief, not lactic
acid. associated lactate metabolism. again, 80% endurance
work not incorporate so-called "burn," 20% work so,
say approximately 20% work, include so-called "burning sensation,"
burning sensation actually triggers activation release certain compounds
molecules glia, brain cell type supports neuron health. actually,
lactate system form fuel brain. increasing interest
generating lactate pushing past lactate threshold small portion, 20% so,
endurance work order support brain health function.
look like protocol? Well, mentioned before, 3:2 ratio. maybe spend
10 weeks 12 weeks focusing mainly endurance, three workouts
per week endurance work, 80% workouts, meaning 80% time
burn threshold, not experiencing burning sensation,
20% it, are. That, based scientific data, support lactate metabolism,
brain health, et cetera, well cardiovascular health oxygen utilization.
forms endurance aware of. two workouts involve
resistance training, again, 80/20 split, 80% work not failure
20% is. maybe 10, 12 weeks, switch, start
emphasizing strength hypertrophy work three workouts endurance
work two workouts. Now, course, will able train six days
week compulsively need train seven days week. decide that,
please aware cortisol threshold real thing. me, 3:2 ratio works
perfectly 'cause like two full days off week. take really depends
schedule feeling. Sometimes two days row. Sometimes
interspersed throughout week. reviewing scientific literature two

just collapse slumber lasts afternoon, able generate alert,
calm, focus states throughout day. lunch, emphasize slightly lower
carbohydrate low carbohydrate intake simple reason adrenaline
dopamine associated neuromodulators going support alertness.
me, fast noon. eat lunch consists sort protein
thing, like meat chicken salmon vegetables, et cetera.
exercised previously, do, mentioned, five days week, will
ingest starches. just red or, bread, excuse me, rice oatmeal


butter nuts things like that. will consume various food groups, say,
will keep total amount carbohydrate little bit low side, haven't
trained, won't carbohydrate all. Not ketogenic, not
inter carbohydrate, not pure carnivore diet, far it,
starches cause release serotonin brain lend state
sleepiness. Now, mention 25% individuals genes encode

lethargy, kind sedation carbohydrates. don't gene,
me, eating noonish meal not enormous, decent size,
mainly protein, healthy fats, lowish carbohydrates no carbohydrates
allows achieve heightened states alertness throughout day,
need purposes. just knowing meats nuts support alertness, provided
don't eat much them, vegetables healthy us therefore
eat them, happen like well, carbohydrates tend
kind sedative like quality them, help guide food choices
intelligent way grounded scientific literature relates alertness.
Now, components foods not alertness, mood?
entire episode mood food, clear, based now dozens
studies, ingesting sufficient levels omega-3 fatty acids going support healthy
mood even can act antidepressant. dozen studies shown
ingesting least 1,000 milligrams per day EPA form essential fatty acid
effective prescription antidepressants relieving depression.
somebody requires prescription antidepressants, Prozac, Zoloft, et cetera, can
allow people take lower doses medications, many cases positive

substance food can improve mood sense wellbeing,
way increasing certain neuromodulators brain, particular dopamine,
also related neuromodulators. eating fatty salmon regularly,
eating krill regularly, meaning whale, ingesting foods tend
lot omega-3s, probably don't need supplement omega-3.
people not ingesting sufficient levels omega-3, certainly one
people. Despite effort eat good foods whole foods, et cetera, unprocessed

often not, really question structuring day,
eating first time, long allowing fast 24-hour cycle,
also whether not getting sufficient omega-3s, whether not getting

01:17:39 Protocol 10: Get Testosterone & Estrogen Ideal Range

basically lot biochemical evidence supports everything just
described. Along lines health wellbeing, remiss didn't mention
hormones. Hormones broad effects body brain. entire month
hormones want hear hormones detail. talked
testosterone optimizing testosterone, estrogen, et cetera. sex steroid
hormones, include testosterone estrogen, which, course, present
varying ratios, men women kids, manufactured
cholesterol. hear cholesterol terrible thing, actually made
cholesterol. don't get sufficient levels cholesterol, can
problematic hormones can problematic brain body
health. without going much detail, just point couple things
that, least blood work subjective experience,
beneficial might want consider. First all, not shy
love butter. will eat packs butter directly. believe people going eat
cheese without cracker, will eat butter without cracker. Butter high cholesterol,
don't eat ton it, least lipid profiles, fine. Butter
cholesterol, precursor sex steroid hormones, men women
need testosterone estrogen order feel good able think. not
want estrogen low testosterone low. eat butter order
ensure get sufficient cholesterol. Butter also things
beneficial, various small fatty acids interesting terms effects
metabolism, et cetera. can look up, benefits butter. again, volume
important can't overdo it. Costello incidentally loves butter well. Along
lines hormones testosterone, get lot questions think
lot online communities sort obsessed testosterone, just want
emphasize that, yes, sufficient levels testosterone vitally important brain
function sufficient levels estrogen will allow brain actually function.
turns estrogen one main ways brain maintains longevity
maintains ability think. seeking optimal testosterone levels
ourselves, testosterone estrogen. many things
discussed now, morning sunlight, exercise, fasting, can support
testosterone estrogen meaningful positive ways. get lot questions


hormone optimization. entire month topic. entire episode
testosterone estrogen optimization. just want briefly highlight two things
relevant, want details, please go see episode.
first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free
testosterone. make particular binding protein called "sex hormone binding
globulin" essentially binds testosterone, prevents free. sounds
like terrible thing, actually good thing allows testosterone
transported various tissues, including brain, can exert various
functions. lower desired levels testosterone much sex
hormone binding globulin, turns 400 milligrams per day something called
"tongkat ali," form ginseng, can actually help increase levels free
testosterone. Many people experience positive subjective effect objective
affects well, meaning increases free testosterone blood analysis.
data that, not ton peer-reviewed literatures, again,
always approach sense caution definitely talked doctor.

looks like, structured within day structured across weeks
fact, based scientific data scientific data say best optimal
order promote longevity brain, ability focus, well cardiovascular health
things know exercise supports. Now, various forms
physical activity call exercise, can generally batched two
categories. First strength hypertrophy work. physical movements
designed make stronger and/or make muscles larger. also
endurance work. Physical exercise movements designed allow
work time extend amount time can work kind,
physical mental. two full podcast episodes details
science protocols related topics. episode science
strength hypertrophy, building strength muscle building. included
lot protocols. episode endurance. build one
four types endurance, muscular endurance, anaerobic, aerobic, long-

can actually detrimental way raises cortisol. cortisol can
good thing appropriately timed appropriate low levels, don't
want cortisol levels throughout day big spikes cortisol
repeatedly. keeping workouts relatively short can definitely help
certainly training hard, 60 minutes less sufficient.
many people, including myself, 45 minutes 50 minutes probably even
optimal. basic design physical exercise approximately 60 minutes.
maybe 60 plus minus 15 minutes well within margins keeping
hormonal health proper not going long making workout short
not beneficial. essentially data tell us order optimize
cardiovascular brain health systems body, want exercise
least five days per week. know seems like lot. certainly lot certain
people. you, compulsive exercisers, might gasp idea taking two
days off. personally find taking two full days off per week actually beneficial
exercise training performance, well pleasant. like rest days.
essentially structure exercise regimen works sake supporting health
going one 3:2 ratio. 12-week period so, maybe
10 12 weeks, three five workouts per week emphasize strength

don't put structure around it. put little bit structure around it.
already said 60 minutes, 60 minutes plus minus 15 minutes, going
optimal health benefits. structure actual workouts?
Well, need address issue intensity. good rule thumb based
literature, discussed Dr. Andy Galpin prior strength hypertrophy
endurance episodes, literature published quality, peer-reviewed
journals really points fact approximately 80% resistance training
resistance training doesn't go call failure, can't
actually move resistance anymore. 20% can higher intensity
failure type training. Now, respect endurance work, one can build endurance
without log long, long mileage extensive mileage pool running.


forms endurance can build up,
instance, capillary beds within muscles. Building capillary beds within
muscles will allow oxygen utilization within muscles, thereby will increase
endurance muscles, also will improve brain metabolism way
heart functions, cardiovascular function. 80/20 rule less failure
work failure resistance exercise regime can transported translated
endurance exercise portion focusing thing familiar with,
burn running hard cycling hard, experience kind burning
muscles associated lactate system. episode endurance,
pointed burn not lactic acid. Contrary common belief, not lactic
acid. associated lactate metabolism. again, 80% endurance
work not incorporate so-called "burn," 20% work so,
say approximately 20% work, include so-called "burning sensation,"
burning sensation actually triggers activation release certain compounds
molecules glia, brain cell type supports neuron health. actually,
lactate system form fuel brain. increasing interest
generating lactate pushing past lactate threshold small portion, 20% so,
endurance work order support brain health function.
look like protocol? Well, mentioned before, 3:2 ratio. maybe spend
10 weeks 12 weeks focusing mainly endurance, three workouts
per week endurance work, 80% workouts, meaning 80% time
burn threshold, not experiencing burning sensation,
20% it, are. That, based scientific data, support lactate metabolism,
brain health, et cetera, well cardiovascular health oxygen utilization.
forms endurance aware of. two workouts involve
resistance training, again, 80/20 split, 80% work not failure
20% is. maybe 10, 12 weeks, switch, start
emphasizing strength hypertrophy work three workouts endurance
work two workouts. Now, course, will able train six days

testosterone estrogen optimization. just want briefly highlight two things
relevant, want details, please go see episode.
first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free
testosterone. make particular binding protein called "sex hormone binding

like terrible thing, actually good thing allows testosterone
transported various tissues, including brain, can exert various
functions. lower desired levels testosterone much sex
hormone binding globulin, turns 400 milligrams per day something called
"tongkat ali," form ginseng, can actually help increase levels free
testosterone. Many people experience positive subjective effect objective
affects well, meaning increases free testosterone blood analysis.

taking walk, walk dog again, protocol, order get evening light,
lowers sensitivity retina late evening hours,
allows buffer negative effects bright light later night.
Now, won't allow blast eyes bright light; still need dim lights
evening. nice study published scientific reports
illustrates one this, go outside view sunlight evening hours

melatonin rhythm stays appropriate. Now, haven't talked much melatonin,
melatonin hormone inhibited light. actually prevented light.
melatonin hormone allows fall asleep easily. Now, not talking

temperature minimum. me, tend wake around 6:30 AM,
means temperature minimum 4:30 AM. can add five hours that.
means 90 minute work fall 9:30 fairly optimized.
10:30 AM, 8:30 AM. Somewhere there, right?
can't say exactly six hours temperature minimum. will find
it, however. precise best time 90-minute work about.
Whether not five six hours temperature minimum going vary

looks like, structured within day structured across weeks
fact, based scientific data scientific data say best optimal
order promote longevity brain, ability focus, well cardiovascular health
things know exercise supports. Now, various forms
physical activity call exercise, can generally batched two
categories. First strength hypertrophy work. physical movements
designed make stronger and/or make muscles larger. also
endurance work. Physical exercise movements designed allow
work time extend amount time can work kind,
physical mental. two full podcast episodes details

strength hypertrophy, building strength muscle building. included
lot protocols. episode endurance. build one
four types endurance, muscular endurance, anaerobic, aerobic, long-

please see episodes. However, right now just want emphasize data
impact day structure day way can incorporate physical
movement way supports brain health. Basically, finished
cognitive work about, 90-minute work about, form physical exercise


hour. data point fact working hard longer hour
can actually detrimental way raises cortisol. cortisol can
good thing appropriately timed appropriate low levels, don't
want cortisol levels throughout day big spikes cortisol
repeatedly. keeping workouts relatively short can definitely help
certainly training hard, 60 minutes less sufficient.
many people, including myself, 45 minutes 50 minutes probably even
optimal. basic design physical exercise approximately 60 minutes.
maybe 60 plus minus 15 minutes well within margins keeping
hormonal health proper not going long making workout short
not beneficial. essentially data tell us order optimize
cardiovascular brain health systems body, want exercise
least five days per week. know seems like lot. certainly lot certain
people. you, compulsive exercisers, might gasp idea taking two
days off. personally find taking two full days off per week actually beneficial
exercise training performance, well pleasant. like rest days.
essentially structure exercise regimen works sake supporting health
going one 3:2 ratio. 12-week period so, maybe
10 12 weeks, three five workouts per week emphasize strength
hypertrophy two emphasize endurance. Then, 10 12 weeks, one
10- 12-week regimen 3:2 ratio prioritizing endurance
work. primarily sorts workouts described endurance episode
protocols. two days, focusing strength hypertrophy
work merely maintain strength hypertrophy, not lose strength
hypertrophy created. lot data now supporting fact

muscles body, organs body, also brain. Many
probably heard physical exercise various kinds can support

like IL-10, provided exercise proper duration not intense

threshold optimal, sub-threshold detrimental? complicated theme
don't put structure around it. put little bit structure around it.
already said 60 minutes, 60 minutes plus minus 15 minutes, going
optimal health benefits. structure actual workouts?
Well, need address issue intensity. good rule thumb based
literature, discussed Dr. Andy Galpin prior strength hypertrophy
endurance episodes, literature published quality, peer-reviewed
journals really points fact approximately 80% resistance training
resistance training doesn't go call failure, can't
actually move resistance anymore. 20% can higher intensity
failure type training. Now, respect endurance work, one can build endurance
without log long, long mileage extensive mileage pool running.


forms endurance can build up,
instance, capillary beds within muscles. Building capillary beds within
muscles will allow oxygen utilization within muscles, thereby will increase
endurance muscles, also will improve brain metabolism way
heart functions, cardiovascular function. 80/20 rule less failure
work failure resistance exercise regime can transported translated
endurance exercise portion focusing thing familiar with,
burn running hard cycling hard, experience kind burning
muscles associated lactate system. episode endurance,
pointed burn not lactic acid. Contrary common belief, not lactic
acid. associated lactate metabolism. again, 80% endurance
work not incorporate so-called "burn," 20% work so,
say approximately 20% work, include so-called "burning sensation,"
burning sensation actually triggers activation release certain compounds
molecules glia, brain cell type supports neuron health. actually,
lactate system form fuel brain. increasing interest
generating lactate pushing past lactate threshold small portion, 20% so,
endurance work order support brain health function.
look like protocol? Well, mentioned before, 3:2 ratio. maybe spend
10 weeks 12 weeks focusing mainly endurance, three workouts
per week endurance work, 80% workouts, meaning 80% time
burn threshold, not experiencing burning sensation,
20% it, are. That, based scientific data, support lactate metabolism,
brain health, et cetera, well cardiovascular health oxygen utilization.
forms endurance aware of. two workouts involve
resistance training, again, 80/20 split, 80% work not failure
20% is. maybe 10, 12 weeks, switch, start
emphasizing strength hypertrophy work three workouts endurance
work two workouts. Now, course, will able train six days
week compulsively need train seven days week. decide that,
please aware cortisol threshold real thing. me, 3:2 ratio works
perfectly 'cause like two full days off week. take really depends

relevant, want details, please go see episode.
first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free
testosterone. make particular binding protein called "sex hormone binding

like terrible thing, actually good thing allows testosterone
transported various tissues, including brain, can exert various
functions. lower desired levels testosterone much sex
hormone binding globulin, turns 400 milligrams per day something called
"tongkat ali," form ginseng, can actually help increase levels free
testosterone. Many people experience positive subjective effect objective
affects well, meaning increases free testosterone blood analysis.

looks like, structured within day structured across weeks
fact, based scientific data scientific data say best optimal
order promote longevity brain, ability focus, well cardiovascular health
things know exercise supports. Now, various forms
physical activity call exercise, can generally batched two
categories. First strength hypertrophy work. physical movements
designed make stronger and/or make muscles larger. also
endurance work. Physical exercise movements designed allow
work time extend amount time can work kind,
physical mental. two full podcast episodes details
science protocols related topics. episode science
strength hypertrophy, building strength muscle building. included
lot protocols. episode endurance. build one
four types endurance, muscular endurance, anaerobic, aerobic, long-

please see episodes. However, right now just want emphasize data
impact day structure day way can incorporate physical

can actually detrimental way raises cortisol. cortisol can
good thing appropriately timed appropriate low levels, don't
want cortisol levels throughout day big spikes cortisol
repeatedly. keeping workouts relatively short can definitely help
certainly training hard, 60 minutes less sufficient.
many people, including myself, 45 minutes 50 minutes probably even
optimal. basic design physical exercise approximately 60 minutes.
maybe 60 plus minus 15 minutes well within margins keeping
hormonal health proper not going long making workout short
not beneficial. essentially data tell us order optimize
cardiovascular brain health systems body, want exercise
least five days per week. know seems like lot. certainly lot certain
people. you, compulsive exercisers, might gasp idea taking two
days off. personally find taking two full days off per week actually beneficial
exercise training performance, well pleasant. like rest days.
essentially structure exercise regimen works sake supporting health
going one 3:2 ratio. 12-week period so, maybe
10 12 weeks, three five workouts per week emphasize strength
hypertrophy two emphasize endurance. Then, 10 12 weeks, one
10- 12-week regimen 3:2 ratio prioritizing endurance
work. primarily sorts workouts described endurance episode

work merely maintain strength hypertrophy, not lose strength
hypertrophy created. lot data now supporting fact

don't put structure around it. put little bit structure around it.
already said 60 minutes, 60 minutes plus minus 15 minutes, going
optimal health benefits. structure actual workouts?
Well, need address issue intensity. good rule thumb based
literature, discussed Dr. Andy Galpin prior strength hypertrophy
endurance episodes, literature published quality, peer-reviewed
journals really points fact approximately 80% resistance training
resistance training doesn't go call failure, can't
actually move resistance anymore. 20% can higher intensity
failure type training. Now, respect endurance work, one can build endurance
without log long, long mileage extensive mileage pool running.


forms endurance can build up,
instance, capillary beds within muscles. Building capillary beds within
muscles will allow oxygen utilization within muscles, thereby will increase
endurance muscles, also will improve brain metabolism way
heart functions, cardiovascular function. 80/20 rule less failure
work failure resistance exercise regime can transported translated
endurance exercise portion focusing thing familiar with,
burn running hard cycling hard, experience kind burning
muscles associated lactate system. episode endurance,
pointed burn not lactic acid. Contrary common belief, not lactic
acid. associated lactate metabolism. again, 80% endurance
work not incorporate so-called "burn," 20% work so,
say approximately 20% work, include so-called "burning sensation,"
burning sensation actually triggers activation release certain compounds
molecules glia, brain cell type supports neuron health. actually,
lactate system form fuel brain. increasing interest
generating lactate pushing past lactate threshold small portion, 20% so,
endurance work order support brain health function.
look like protocol? Well, mentioned before, 3:2 ratio. maybe spend
10 weeks 12 weeks focusing mainly endurance, three workouts
per week endurance work, 80% workouts, meaning 80% time
burn threshold, not experiencing burning sensation,
20% it, are. That, based scientific data, support lactate metabolism,
brain health, et cetera, well cardiovascular health oxygen utilization.
forms endurance aware of. two workouts involve
resistance training, again, 80/20 split, 80% work not failure
20% is. maybe 10, 12 weeks, switch, start
emphasizing strength hypertrophy work three workouts endurance
work two workouts. Now, course, will able train six days

relevant, want details, please go see episode.
first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free
testosterone. make particular binding protein called "sex hormone binding

like terrible thing, actually good thing allows testosterone
transported various tissues, including brain, can exert various
functions. lower desired levels testosterone much sex
hormone binding globulin, turns 400 milligrams per day something called
"tongkat ali," form ginseng, can actually help increase levels free
testosterone. Many people experience positive subjective effect objective

optimal health benefits. structure actual workouts?
Well, need address issue intensity. good rule thumb based
literature, discussed Dr. Andy Galpin prior strength hypertrophy
endurance episodes, literature published quality, peer-reviewed
journals really points fact approximately 80% resistance training
resistance training doesn't go call failure, can't
actually move resistance anymore. 20% can higher intensity
failure type training. Now, respect endurance work, one can build endurance
without log long, long mileage extensive mileage pool running.


forms endurance can build up,
instance, capillary beds within muscles. Building capillary beds within
muscles will allow oxygen utilization within muscles, thereby will increase
endurance muscles, also will improve brain metabolism way
heart functions, cardiovascular function. 80/20 rule less failure
work failure resistance exercise regime can transported translated
endurance exercise portion focusing thing familiar with,
burn running hard cycling hard, experience kind burning
muscles associated lactate system. episode endurance,
pointed burn not lactic acid. Contrary common belief, not lactic
acid. associated lactate metabolism. again, 80% endurance
work not incorporate so-called "burn," 20% work so,
say approximately 20% work, include so-called "burning sensation,"
burning sensation actually triggers activation release certain compounds
molecules glia, brain cell type supports neuron health. actually,
lactate system form fuel brain. increasing interest
generating lactate pushing past lactate threshold small portion, 20% so,
endurance work order support brain health function.
look like protocol? Well, mentioned before, 3:2 ratio. maybe spend
10 weeks 12 weeks focusing mainly endurance, three workouts
per week endurance work, 80% workouts, meaning 80% time
burn threshold, not experiencing burning sensation,
20% it, are. That, based scientific data, support lactate metabolism,
brain health, et cetera, well cardiovascular health oxygen utilization.
forms endurance aware of. two workouts involve
resistance training, again, 80/20 split, 80% work not failure
20% is. maybe 10, 12 weeks, switch, start
emphasizing strength hypertrophy work three workouts endurance
work two workouts. Now, course, will able train six days

looks like, structured within day structured across weeks
fact, based scientific data scientific data say best optimal
order promote longevity brain, ability focus, well cardiovascular health
things know exercise supports. Now, various forms
physical activity call exercise, can generally batched two
categories. First strength hypertrophy work. physical movements
designed make stronger and/or make muscles larger. also
endurance work. Physical exercise movements designed allow
work time extend amount time can work kind,
physical mental. two full podcast episodes details
science protocols related topics. episode science
strength hypertrophy, building strength muscle building. included
lot protocols. episode endurance. build one
four types endurance, muscular endurance, anaerobic, aerobic, long-

please see episodes. However, right now just want emphasize data
impact day structure day way can incorporate physical
movement way supports brain health. Basically, finished
cognitive work about, 90-minute work about, form physical exercise

can actually detrimental way raises cortisol. cortisol can
good thing appropriately timed appropriate low levels, don't
want cortisol levels throughout day big spikes cortisol
repeatedly. keeping workouts relatively short can definitely help
certainly training hard, 60 minutes less sufficient.
many people, including myself, 45 minutes 50 minutes probably even
optimal. basic design physical exercise approximately 60 minutes.
maybe 60 plus minus 15 minutes well within margins keeping
hormonal health proper not going long making workout short
not beneficial. essentially data tell us order optimize
cardiovascular brain health systems body, want exercise
least five days per week. know seems like lot. certainly lot certain
people. you, compulsive exercisers, might gasp idea taking two
days off. personally find taking two full days off per week actually beneficial
exercise training performance, well pleasant. like rest days.
essentially structure exercise regimen works sake supporting health
going one 3:2 ratio. 12-week period so, maybe
10 12 weeks, three five workouts per week emphasize strength
hypertrophy two emphasize endurance. Then, 10 12 weeks, one
10- 12-week regimen 3:2 ratio prioritizing endurance

threshold optimal, sub-threshold detrimental? complicated theme
don't put structure around it. put little bit structure around it.
already said 60 minutes, 60 minutes plus minus 15 minutes, going
optimal health benefits. structure actual workouts?
Well, need address issue intensity. good rule thumb based
literature, discussed Dr. Andy Galpin prior strength hypertrophy
endurance episodes, literature published quality, peer-reviewed
journals really points fact approximately 80% resistance training
resistance training doesn't go call failure, can't
actually move resistance anymore. 20% can higher intensity
failure type training. Now, respect endurance work, one can build endurance
without log long, long mileage extensive mileage pool running.


forms endurance can build up,
instance, capillary beds within muscles. Building capillary beds within
muscles will allow oxygen utilization within muscles, thereby will increase
endurance muscles, also will improve brain metabolism way
heart functions, cardiovascular function. 80/20 rule less failure
work failure resistance exercise regime can transported translated
endurance exercise portion focusing thing familiar with,
burn running hard cycling hard, experience kind burning
muscles associated lactate system. episode endurance,
pointed burn not lactic acid. Contrary common belief, not lactic
acid. associated lactate metabolism. again, 80% endurance
work not incorporate so-called "burn," 20% work so,
say approximately 20% work, include so-called "burning sensation,"
burning sensation actually triggers activation release certain compounds
molecules glia, brain cell type supports neuron health. actually,
lactate system form fuel brain. increasing interest
generating lactate pushing past lactate threshold small portion, 20% so,
endurance work order support brain health function.
look like protocol? Well, mentioned before, 3:2 ratio. maybe spend
10 weeks 12 weeks focusing mainly endurance, three workouts
per week endurance work, 80% workouts, meaning 80% time
burn threshold, not experiencing burning sensation,
20% it, are. That, based scientific data, support lactate metabolism,
brain health, et cetera, well cardiovascular health oxygen utilization.
forms endurance aware of. two workouts involve
resistance training, again, 80/20 split, 80% work not failure
20% is. maybe 10, 12 weeks, switch, start
emphasizing strength hypertrophy work three workouts endurance
work two workouts. Now, course, will able train six days

hormone optimization. entire month topic. entire episode
testosterone estrogen optimization. just want briefly highlight two things
relevant, want details, please go see episode.
first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free
testosterone. make particular binding protein called "sex hormone binding
globulin" essentially binds testosterone, prevents free. sounds
like terrible thing, actually good thing allows testosterone
transported various tissues, including brain, can exert various
functions. lower desired levels testosterone much sex
hormone binding globulin, turns 400 milligrams per day something called
"tongkat ali," form ginseng, can actually help increase levels free
testosterone. Many people experience positive subjective effect objective
affects well, meaning increases free testosterone blood analysis.

Well, need address issue intensity. good rule thumb based
literature, discussed Dr. Andy Galpin prior strength hypertrophy
endurance episodes, literature published quality, peer-reviewed

resistance training doesn't go call failure, can't
actually move resistance anymore. 20% can higher intensity

without log long, long mileage extensive mileage pool running.


forms endurance can build up,

work failure resistance exercise regime can transported translated
endurance exercise portion focusing thing familiar with,
burn running hard cycling hard, experience kind burning

pointed burn not lactic acid. Contrary common belief, not lactic
acid. associated lactate metabolism. again, 80% endurance
work not incorporate so-called "burn," 20% work so,
say approximately 20% work, include so-called "burning sensation,"
burning sensation actually triggers activation release certain compounds
molecules glia, brain cell type supports neuron health. actually,
lactate system form fuel brain. increasing interest
generating lactate pushing past lactate threshold small portion, 20% so,
endurance work order support brain health function.
look like protocol? Well, mentioned before, 3:2 ratio. maybe spend
10 weeks 12 weeks focusing mainly endurance, three workouts

20% it, are. That, based scientific data, support lactate metabolism,

Well, need address issue intensity. good rule thumb based
literature, discussed Dr. Andy Galpin prior strength hypertrophy
endurance episodes, literature published quality, peer-reviewed

resistance training doesn't go call failure, can't
actually move resistance anymore. 20% can higher intensity
failure type training. Now, respect endurance work, one can build endurance
without log long, long mileage extensive mileage pool running.


forms endurance can build up,
instance, capillary beds within muscles. Building capillary beds within
muscles will allow oxygen utilization within muscles, thereby will increase
endurance muscles, also will improve brain metabolism way

work failure resistance exercise regime can transported translated
endurance exercise portion focusing thing familiar with,
burn running hard cycling hard, experience kind burning

work not incorporate so-called "burn," 20% work so,
say approximately 20% work, include so-called "burning sensation,"
burning sensation actually triggers activation release certain compounds

look like protocol? Well, mentioned before, 3:2 ratio. maybe spend

intelligent way grounded scientific literature relates alertness.
Now, components foods not alertness, mood?
entire episode mood food, clear, based now dozens
studies, ingesting sufficient levels omega-3 fatty acids going support healthy

hormone optimization. entire month topic. entire episode
testosterone estrogen optimization. just want briefly highlight two things
relevant, want details, please go see episode.
first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free
testosterone. make particular binding protein called "sex hormone binding
globulin" essentially binds testosterone, prevents free. sounds
like terrible thing, actually good thing allows testosterone
transported various tissues, including brain, can exert various
functions. lower desired levels testosterone much sex
hormone binding globulin, turns 400 milligrams per day something called
"tongkat ali," form ginseng, can actually help increase levels free
testosterone. Many people experience positive subjective effect objective
affects well, meaning increases free testosterone blood analysis.
data that, not ton peer-reviewed literatures, again,
always approach sense caution definitely talked doctor.
want learn that, can go examine.com. lot information
listed that. compound relevant men women,
say people trying optimize testosterone and/or estrogen, Fadogia.
Fadogia agrestis actually herb increases levels called "luteinizing
hormone." Luteinizing hormone hormone released hypothalamus
within brain travels gonads, either ovaries testes, stimulate
release estrogen testosterone. Fadogia agrestis shown, albeit
limited number studies, increase levels luteinizing hormone thereby levels

Matt Walker Berkeley whose name sure familiar with.
wrote wonderful book, "Why Sleep." Naps 90 minutes less, 20-
minute naps fine, not longer 90 minutes. essentially two
varieties people: people napping interferes falling asleep later night
staying asleep people nap not interfere. decide
are. somebody can nap not trouble falling
asleep staying asleep later night, well, means, nap. Just make 90
minutes less. Again, 90-minute cycles really vital constraint
obey. 91 minutes, don't worry. won't dissolve puddle tears.
starting sleep hour afternoon, can problematic.
somebody can nap 10, 20 minutes, probably better getting

figure right you. lot variety there. essentially
science says.

01:33:29 Protocol 13: View Late Afternoon/Evening Light Support Sleep & Dopamine

Now, whether not nap whether not not nap, key protocol sleep

10:00 PM 4:00 can disrupt learning memory, can disrupt immune
system can disrupt mood long-lasting ways. ways offset that,
however. call "Netflix inoculation." like stay late
tablet computer watching Netflix, getting little bit afternoon light
eyes, somewhat counter-intuitively, can prevent disruption bright light later
evening, least somewhat. mean that? Well, view light sun
starting go down, step outside around 4:00 PM, 5:00 PM, again, time
exactly will depend time year located planet,
sun starts head down, don't necessarily see sunset, it'd lovely
could, sunsets beautiful, can get outside see sun arcs
down, can't see sun directly, get sunlight eyes afternoon
hours, maybe 4:00 PMish, 20, 30 minutes, maybe reading outside
taking walk, walk dog again, protocol, order get evening light,
lowers sensitivity retina late evening hours,
allows buffer negative effects bright light later night.
Now, won't allow blast eyes bright light; still need dim lights
evening. nice study published scientific reports
illustrates one this, go outside view sunlight evening hours
anywhere five 30 minutes, realized people range
constraints schedule, five 30 minutes, happens
melatonin rhythm stays appropriate. Now, haven't talked much melatonin,
melatonin hormone inhibited light. actually prevented light.
melatonin hormone allows fall asleep easily. Now, not talking
supplementing melatonin; talking melatonin naturally produce
pineal. protocol simple: get outside afternoon evening 10
30 minutes, take sunglasses off, get bright light, get natural light
eyes. can't that, probably better just stay standard artificial lights
inside. Don't crank up, just start dim them. Again, time
avoid blue blockers. People popping blue blockers four o'clock afternoon
'cause worried blue light going disrupt sleep. Well, making
eyes sensitive light might see later evening, blue light
otherwise. get afternoon light. probably notice optimal

there. people really tracking sleep sleep time.
that, great. not something personally do, although keep telling

01:39:00 Protocol 14: Eat Dinner Promotes Serotonin, Calm Sleep

mean puts better mood overall, better state learning, et cetera. get
afternoon light well. point evening, eat thing call
dinner. feels sort strange talk dinner, reason want talk
dinner eat dinner me, dinner, course,
eating- mention love eating- also optimizing transition sleep
sleep. obviously eat foods enjoy. not one people will eat
anything avoid eating anything simply benefit that. enjoy food very,
much. dinner generally comprised things going support rest
deep sleep. means starchy carbohydrates. absolutely clear one
major ways can increase serotonin, helps transition sleep,
ingesting starchy carbohydrates. Now, realized starchy carbohydrates kind
demonized term nowadays everyone's anti-carbs, but, know, really
distinguish refined sugars complex carbohydrates.


episode this. talked refined sugars disrupt, not just metabolism,
actually disrupt neurons gut sense fatty acids amino
acids fats proteins. neurons can actually respond sugar

want increase amount serotonin brain can actually fall
asleep night. Many people low-carbohydrate diets struggle falling
staying asleep, hard achieve heightened levels
serotonin necessary enter sleep. also mention melatonin
serotonin fall pathway. related hormones neuromodulators.
won't go biosynthesis now, essentially talking
system biasing us towards rest relaxation opposed wakefulness.
might ask, "Well, can't just take serotonin? Can't just take 5-HTP precursor
serotonin tryptophan?" indeed can, however, many people including myself,
find supplement serotonin evening night, can cause
problems architecture structure sleep. can cause lot people,
including me, fall asleep fast, sleep deeply three four hours,
wake terrible time falling back asleep. effect, least me, can

although please check physician taking anything, specific forms


magnesium, something called "apigenin" "theanine." Magnesium comes many
forms. Magnesium malate shown improve recovery sore muscles,

first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free
testosterone. make particular binding protein called "sex hormone binding

although please check physician taking anything, specific forms


magnesium, something called "apigenin" "theanine." Magnesium comes many
forms. Magnesium malate shown improve recovery sore muscles,

testosterone estrogen optimization. just want briefly highlight two things
relevant, want details, please go see episode.
first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free
testosterone. make particular binding protein called "sex hormone binding
globulin" essentially binds testosterone, prevents free. sounds
like terrible thing, actually good thing allows testosterone
transported various tissues, including brain, can exert various
functions. lower desired levels testosterone much sex
hormone binding globulin, turns 400 milligrams per day something called
"tongkat ali," form ginseng, can actually help increase levels free
testosterone. Many people experience positive subjective effect objective
affects well, meaning increases free testosterone blood analysis.

first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free
testosterone. make particular binding protein called "sex hormone binding

like terrible thing, actually good thing allows testosterone
transported various tissues, including brain, can exert various
functions. lower desired levels testosterone much sex
hormone binding globulin, turns 400 milligrams per day something called
"tongkat ali," form ginseng, can actually help increase levels free
testosterone. Many people experience positive subjective effect objective
affects well, meaning increases free testosterone blood analysis.

Now, won't allow blast eyes bright light; still need dim lights
evening. nice study published scientific reports
illustrates one this, go outside view sunlight evening hours

melatonin rhythm stays appropriate. Now, haven't talked much melatonin,
melatonin hormone inhibited light. actually prevented light.
melatonin hormone allows fall asleep easily. Now, not talking

pineal. protocol simple: get outside afternoon evening 10
30 minutes, take sunglasses off, get bright light, get natural light

first testosterone can exert various functions unbound form, free
testosterone. make particular binding protein called "sex hormone binding

staying asleep people nap not interfere. decide
are. somebody can nap not trouble falling
asleep staying asleep later night, well, means, nap. Just make 90
minutes less. Again, 90-minute cycles really vital constraint

somebody can nap 10, 20 minutes, probably better getting

melatonin rhythm stays appropriate. Now, haven't talked much melatonin,
melatonin hormone inhibited light. actually prevented light.
melatonin hormone allows fall asleep easily. Now, not talking

although please check physician taking anything, specific forms


magnesium, something called "apigenin" "theanine." Magnesium comes many
forms. Magnesium malate shown improve recovery sore muscles,

reason melatonin will aid transition sleep, won't keep

wake unable fall back asleep. Three compounds can
beneficial aiding transition sleep wide safety margins,
although please check physician taking anything, specific forms


magnesium, something called "apigenin" "theanine." Magnesium comes many
forms. Magnesium malate shown improve recovery sore muscles,

don't know people taking hormone effects.
reason melatonin will aid transition sleep, won't keep

wake unable fall back asleep. Three compounds can
beneficial aiding transition sleep wide safety margins,
although please check physician taking anything, specific forms


magnesium, something called "apigenin" "theanine." Magnesium comes many
forms. Magnesium malate shown improve recovery sore muscles,
instance. Magnesium citrate excellent laxative, instance, Magnesium threonate,
T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, threonate, magnesium bisglycinate transporters

rumination, planning, call "executive function." many people,
taking 300 400 milligrams magnesium bisglycinate magnesium threonate,
referring elemental magnesium aficionados, many people find
30 60 minutes sleep can aid falling asleep, can really
help fall asleep faster stay asleep. people, however, achieve
gastrointestinal discomfort magnesium therefore avoid it. Magnesium
threonate magnesium bisglycinate many people work, however,
coupled apigenin theanine, provide sort synergy sleep cocktail

taking walk, walk dog again, protocol, order get evening light,
lowers sensitivity retina late evening hours,
allows buffer negative effects bright light later night.
Now, won't allow blast eyes bright light; still need dim lights
evening. nice study published scientific reports
illustrates one this, go outside view sunlight evening hours
anywhere five 30 minutes, realized people range

melatonin rhythm stays appropriate. Now, haven't talked much melatonin,
melatonin hormone inhibited light. actually prevented light.
melatonin hormone allows fall asleep easily. Now, not talking

certain things properly prior arrival 2:00 3:00 PM. Now, napper
want nap, no big deal. Naps can wonderfully beneficial. rules
around napping according sleep science. Stanford excellent sleep clinic.
consulted Jamie Zeitzer, colleague Stanford Sleep Laboratory, well
Matt Walker Berkeley whose name sure familiar with.
wrote wonderful book, "Why Sleep." Naps 90 minutes less, 20-
minute naps fine, not longer 90 minutes. essentially two
varieties people: people napping interferes falling asleep later night
staying asleep people nap not interfere. decide
are. somebody can nap not trouble falling
asleep staying asleep later night, well, means, nap. Just make 90
minutes less. Again, 90-minute cycles really vital constraint
obey. 91 minutes, don't worry. won't dissolve puddle tears.

somebody can nap 10, 20 minutes, probably better getting

01:33:29 Protocol 13: View Late Afternoon/Evening Light Support Sleep & Dopamine

Now, whether not nap whether not not nap, key protocol sleep
health wakefulness metabolism hormone health viewing light
afternoon. reason this. progress evening hours,
phenomenon retina, eyes, become sensitive light,
view bright lights even not bright lights hours 10:00 PM
4:00 AM, strongly disruptive, disruptive dopamine production.
can really screw sleep, actually shown data David Berson's
lab Brown University, one foremost circadian biology laboratories, well
Samer Hattar's laboratory National Institute Mental Health viewing bright
light, even not bright light, hours 11:00 PM 4:00 even


10:00 PM 4:00 can disrupt learning memory, can disrupt immune
system can disrupt mood long-lasting ways. ways offset that,
however. call "Netflix inoculation." like stay late
tablet computer watching Netflix, getting little bit afternoon light
eyes, somewhat counter-intuitively, can prevent disruption bright light later
evening, least somewhat. mean that? Well, view light sun
starting go down, step outside around 4:00 PM, 5:00 PM, again, time
exactly will depend time year located planet,
sun starts head down, don't necessarily see sunset, it'd lovely
could, sunsets beautiful, can get outside see sun arcs
down, can't see sun directly, get sunlight eyes afternoon
hours, maybe 4:00 PMish, 20, 30 minutes, maybe reading outside
taking walk, walk dog again, protocol, order get evening light,
lowers sensitivity retina late evening hours,
allows buffer negative effects bright light later night.
Now, won't allow blast eyes bright light; still need dim lights
evening. nice study published scientific reports
illustrates one this, go outside view sunlight evening hours
anywhere five 30 minutes, realized people range
constraints schedule, five 30 minutes, happens
melatonin rhythm stays appropriate. Now, haven't talked much melatonin,
melatonin hormone inhibited light. actually prevented light.
melatonin hormone allows fall asleep easily. Now, not talking
supplementing melatonin; talking melatonin naturally produce
pineal. protocol simple: get outside afternoon evening 10
30 minutes, take sunglasses off, get bright light, get natural light
eyes. can't that, probably better just stay standard artificial lights
inside. Don't crank up, just start dim them. Again, time
avoid blue blockers. People popping blue blockers four o'clock afternoon
'cause worried blue light going disrupt sleep. Well, making
eyes sensitive light might see later evening, blue light
otherwise. get afternoon light. probably notice optimal

01:39:00 Protocol 14: Eat Dinner Promotes Serotonin, Calm Sleep

mean puts better mood overall, better state learning, et cetera. get
afternoon light well. point evening, eat thing call
dinner. feels sort strange talk dinner, reason want talk
dinner eat dinner me, dinner, course,
eating- mention love eating- also optimizing transition sleep
sleep. obviously eat foods enjoy. not one people will eat
anything avoid eating anything simply benefit that. enjoy food very,
much. dinner generally comprised things going support rest
deep sleep. means starchy carbohydrates. absolutely clear one
major ways can increase serotonin, helps transition sleep,
ingesting starchy carbohydrates. Now, realized starchy carbohydrates kind
demonized term nowadays everyone's anti-carbs, but, know, really
distinguish refined sugars complex carbohydrates.


episode this. talked refined sugars disrupt, not just metabolism,
actually disrupt neurons gut sense fatty acids amino

find supplement serotonin evening night, can cause

drop temperature necessary fall stay asleep. mentioned earlier
early parts day waking, body temperature rising, continues
throughout day. sometime late afternoon, temperature peaks,
starts drop. drop temperature one three degrees vitally
important us able fall asleep easily. One way can decrease
transition time sleep accelerate drop temperature. one way
accelerate drop temperature somewhat counter-intuitively use hot baths, hot
showers, access one, sauna. Now, counterintuitive
say, "Well, hot bath, going heat up." actually, get

don't know people taking hormone effects.
reason melatonin will aid transition sleep, won't keep
asleep. many people take melatonin find fall asleep quickly,
wake unable fall back asleep. Three compounds can
beneficial aiding transition sleep wide safety margins,
although please check physician taking anything, specific forms


magnesium, something called "apigenin" "theanine." Magnesium comes many
forms. Magnesium malate shown improve recovery sore muscles,
instance. Magnesium citrate excellent laxative, instance, Magnesium threonate,
T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, threonate, magnesium bisglycinate transporters
allow cross blood-brain barrier readily forms
magnesium. within brain, promote release neurotransmitter
called GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter shuts off forebrain
extent. doesn't shut off completely, essentially shuts thinking,
rumination, planning, call "executive function." many people,
taking 300 400 milligrams magnesium bisglycinate magnesium threonate,
referring elemental magnesium aficionados, many people find
30 60 minutes sleep can aid falling asleep, can really
help fall asleep faster stay asleep. people, however, achieve
gastrointestinal discomfort magnesium therefore avoid it. Magnesium
threonate magnesium bisglycinate many people work, however,
coupled apigenin theanine, provide sort synergy sleep cocktail
seems effective aiding transition sleep. apigenin substance
found chamomile. 50 milligrams apigenin taken 30 minutes sleep
can act another way shut off forebrain reduce rumination, reduce anxiety,
allow people fall stay asleep. podcast Dr. Darya Rose. got
excellent podcast highly recommend check out. Covers number
different health, scientific, subjects. PhD neuroscience, terrific
scientist, et cetera. big fan apigenin, I. third compound
theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E. Theanine compound can also increase GABA,

bisglycinate, apigenin, theanine combination can effective aiding
transition sleep. realized not everyone wants take supplements.
certainly not pushing these. hope everybody able fall asleep

varieties people: people napping interferes falling asleep later night
staying asleep people nap not interfere. decide
are. somebody can nap not trouble falling
asleep staying asleep later night, well, means, nap. Just make 90
minutes less. Again, 90-minute cycles really vital constraint
obey. 91 minutes, don't worry. won't dissolve puddle tears.
starting sleep hour afternoon, can problematic.
somebody can nap 10, 20 minutes, probably better getting
full 90-minute cycle, unless didn't get enough sleep night before. really
figure right you. lot variety there. essentially
science says.

reason melatonin will aid transition sleep, won't keep

wake unable fall back asleep. Three compounds can
beneficial aiding transition sleep wide safety margins,
although please check physician taking anything, specific forms


magnesium, something called "apigenin" "theanine." Magnesium comes many
forms. Magnesium malate shown improve recovery sore muscles,
instance. Magnesium citrate excellent laxative, instance, Magnesium threonate,
T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, threonate, magnesium bisglycinate transporters
allow cross blood-brain barrier readily forms
magnesium. within brain, promote release neurotransmitter
called GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter shuts off forebrain
extent. doesn't shut off completely, essentially shuts thinking,
rumination, planning, call "executive function." many people,
taking 300 400 milligrams magnesium bisglycinate magnesium threonate,
referring elemental magnesium aficionados, many people find
30 60 minutes sleep can aid falling asleep, can really
help fall asleep faster stay asleep. people, however, achieve
gastrointestinal discomfort magnesium therefore avoid it. Magnesium
threonate magnesium bisglycinate many people work, however,
coupled apigenin theanine, provide sort synergy sleep cocktail
seems effective aiding transition sleep. apigenin substance
found chamomile. 50 milligrams apigenin taken 30 minutes sleep
can act another way shut off forebrain reduce rumination, reduce anxiety,
allow people fall stay asleep. podcast Dr. Darya Rose. got
excellent podcast highly recommend check out. Covers number
different health, scientific, subjects. PhD neuroscience, terrific
