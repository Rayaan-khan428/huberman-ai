00:08:28 Neurosurgeon’s View Brain, Neurosurgery Specialization

livemomentis.com huberman now discussion Dr Casey
Halpern Casey say Dr Halpern listening welcome thank great
yeah long time coming colleagues Stanford recently
moved course University Pennsylvania also incredible institution sorry
lose better sweet Stanford's loss upenn's gain um
talk work uh past present told listeners already
neurosurgeon consider astronauts Neuroscience
somewhat Uncharted Territory Uncharted Territory yet Precision
everything right margins error small aren't familiar
differences neurosurgery neurology Psychiatry just educate us
bit neurosurgeon fact nurse surgeon
view brain think conceptualize brain yeah
scope neurosurgery quite broad uh medical school drawn
neurosurgery procedure known deep brain stimulation
Penn college student actually watched first deep brain stimulation surgery
performed Gordon boltuck date one career mentors deep brain
stimulation one surgery neurosurgeons offer actually sort small
minority neurosurgery know take brain tumors clip
aneurysms brain take care patients traumatic brain injury
concussion spine surgeries ninety percent neurosurgeons around country
uh know taking care herniated discs lumbar fusions know scope
entire central nervous system include including peripheral nervous system
take care patients carpal tunnel syndrome nerve disorders now
course past two decades mission field sub-
specialize historically neurosurgeons everything domain now
sub-specialize lucky Penn Medicine can focus one
areas chief stereotactic functional Neurosurgery deep brain


stimulation surgery compliment focus ultrasound transcranial Focus
ultrasound non-invasive way ablation brain recently FDA
approved FDA approved Trevor moment uh two procedures
every day uh still minority neurosurgeons offer
majority neurosurgery mind bit structural physiology
deeply rooted brain functions take brain tumor find
safe trajectory get brain tumor remove help
patient recover ICU similar brain aneurysm often don't go
brain clip brain aneurysm go around brain brain get
mind surgeries bit structural deep brain stimulation
surgery routinely procedure yes structure involved course
place thin wire insulated deep part brain
involved Parkinson's disease example uh actually not therapy
therapy delivering electrical stimulation tip wire one tips
actually multiple contacts bottom wire small uh
done operating room know stimulation wire connected
battery pack pulse generator kind like pacemaker deliver
therapy always tell patients bit like implant uh tool
deliver medication medication going form electricity
going delivered small region brain procedure
inspired not just become

00:13:05 Deep Brain Stimulation & Unexpected Positive Effects

neurosurgeon really defined focus research laboratory well Maybe
way antidote tell us one outrageous surprising
knows um delightful thrilling things brain observed
consequence stimulating different brain areas know textbooks always hear
uh kind dark stuff know stimulate one brain area somebody goes
rage stimulate another brain area person starts laughing uncontrollably first um
given information hope not much information
textbooks incorrect sorts statements true can one observe
clinic interesting uh don't necessarily mean
entertaining um surprising things seen poked around


brain deliberately course uh seen heard
say amazed effects uh every day yeah privileged able
interact human brain way always goal trying
provide somebody meaningful therapy deliver electrical stimulation
know electrodes might sitting small region
brain regions within millimeters electrodes
stimulated cause temporary brief side effect moment laughter like
said moment panic course can just shut electrode off often
side effects therapeutic actually discovered ways
use deep brain stimulation not just movement disorders like Parkinson's disease
example patients Parkinson's disease psychiatric uh uh
comorbidity like depression obsessive-compulsive disorder lot patients
highly compulsive impulsive sometimes problems actually melt away
trying help Tremor patients also tell us gambling issue
gotten better mood improved well know probably
one reason know can help somebody's Mood making Tremor
go away course see laughter clinic sometimes
stimulating parts brain not just involved
motor circuits also involved call limbic circuit part brain
involved emotion learn modulate areas therapeutically step
step can actually develop therapies indications like depression
say impressive consistent effect patient
Tremor tremming past 20 years can deliver stimulation
electrode clinic immediate relief Tremor
effect inspired neurosurgeon college never really
wanted anything else X accept help develop type therapeutic another
another kind symptom interested obesity related Eating Disorders
compulsive Behavior urge uh something might delicious
dangerous unhealthy drug compulsion like see OCD pests
compulsive disorder uh interestingly like see Tremor melt away deliver
electricity certain part brain can see psychiatric psychiatric
problems not psychiatric disorders say disorders brain can
see symptoms disorders also improve often immediately just like
Tremor see time pick one uh challenge


everyday speed relief described
Tremor really um incredible just thinking drug therapies
side effects still lot mysteries instance ssris even work
work

00:17:20 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Prescriptions & Cognitive Therapies

timing always challenge timing dosage yes absolutely um love learn
OCD several reasons asking first
somewhat obsessive person tend narrowly focused although confess
not step function takes time turn off chatter
thought train mode uh thinking work hard exit
mode like deep Trench adaptive circumstances less adaptive
others know kid uh little bit grunting tick
used intense intense desire clear throat um point
dad said like need stop used squeeze hand every time
used hide back seat car closet provided
much relief eventually passed yes wasn't medicated never anything
every now fatigued working lot notice
starts come back like kind grunting sort like pet
neurological symptom reminds circuits exist us
sometimes go haywire sometimes just subtle um know
excitation something sort third reason get thousands
questions OCD perhaps just tell us OCD sure um
brain areas involved current range treatments
difference someone obsessive somebody true OCD
brief disclosure neurosurgeon take care patients severe obsessive-
compulsive disorder um perspective OCD may little bit different
psychiatrist lives breathes OCD sees patients every single day
OCD probably take care three five patients year deep brain stimulation
obsessive-compulsive disorders don't see patients routinely
laboratory geared researcher focused trying improve outcomes
deep brain stimulation OCD feel expertise perspective
share just brief disclosure feel neurosurgeon obligated


better understand obsessions brain come can
interrupt stop compulsion associated obsession sort
intrinsic feature OCD uh better actually example
offer patient Tremor deep brain stimulation surgery course
risk procedure outcome consistent positive many patients
willing take risk uh obsessive compulsion compulsive disorder
surgery risk however benefit not quite robust lot
patients referring psychiatrists reluctant refer patients us
completely understandable uh leading Endeavor number
collaborators around country try better understand circuits brain uh
study humans invasively non-invasively
electrode-based surgery sort like epilepsy understand seizures
come want understand better obsessions come also
working imaging experts geneticists understand OCD broader level
well uh consider OCD spectrum disorder way uh apologize
might feel using term incorrectly using way
describe patients obsessions even related compulsions might not
meet criteria OCD may something Andrew
neurosurgeon really obsessive safety compulsive surgical
procedures know think aspect OCD often joke
know consider seriously people suffer uh
aspect helps us know famous uh CEOs probably level
OCD uh surgeons scientists alike perhaps can controlled asset
uh goes awry uncontrollable becomes obsessive-compulsive
disorder tend see patients severe failed
medication multiple medications worth trying OCD can
actually helpful neurotransmitter systems tend poke well
ssris sort first line OCD also tricyclics can helpful still
serotonin system know serotonin system interacts know
neurogenergic system dopamine system hard specific one
things think also hard us predict medications
going work kinds patients tricyclics ssris can helpful
definitely first line others exposure response prevention uh
probably effective option kind like cognitive behavioral therapy


different offered psychologists whole field
field say whole clinic institution focused started Edna foa
Penn patients uh offer types cognitive
therapies exposure stressor try get patients habituate whatever
stresses causes uh compulsions help patients live every
day function fabulously helpful therapies variety patients
still 30 patients still suffer OCD severe
OCD sometimes moderate severe patients really
motivated try help um therapies patients right now say
worth pursuing not optimal um one things
balance researcher see patients like want
everything can help think important educate patients risks
benefits deep brain stimulation surgery also capsulotomy
ablation approach little bit like deep brain stimulation rather
delivering stimulation electrode can actually heat tissue even
destroy say part brain safe destroy kind like
appendix um others say safer modulate seen patients well
ablations know asked earlier find amazing
brain effects can sometimes lack effect
amazing can actually Traverse parts brain without adverse effects
patients function least can test can also destroy small parts
brain talking three four millimeters size little ablations can really
helpful patients no obvious side effects can tell perhaps short
recovery surgery nonetheless despite safe might surgical
procedures still surgical procedures patients hesitant perceived especially
know chance transformative effect quite low can generally
achieve responder rate 50 percent responders still symptomatic
OCD really uh sort inspired really find way deliver therapies
disease specific symptom-specific way years away probably


00:25:40 Brain Areas OCD, Risk, Rewards & Addiction

therapy since part research study moment brain areas


think think OCD years ago remember opening textbook think
undergraduate still work Judith Rappaport National Institutes
mental health late 80s early 90s um done neuroimaging
maybe pet Imaging technique identified portions
basal ganglia sure caudi putanum type structures OCD maybe differences
boys versus girls brain areas sex differences terms OCD
one come clinic know sort work ablations
stimulation uh first start probe brain yeah uh
disorder cortex Sub sub cortex uh cortical control areas areas
involved inhibitory control found not function properly patients
OCD areas like orbital frontal cortex prefrontal cortex image
areas study even rodent model OCD quite honestly models
model aspects OCD OCD human condition can't really model
whole condition mouse wrap perhaps can model compulsive
behavior rat sure pulling hair yeah exactly know not
necessarily obsessive compulsive disorder compulsive behavior perhaps
can ameliorate rat might helpful patient OCD
approach animal modeling OCD thoughtfully uh scientists
think uh study OCD models humans imaging
trying invasively electrodes like epilepsy patients find
areas cortex like prefrontal orbital frontal cortex not functioning
will way non-oc patient often hyper functioning uh
might say Well hyper functioning aren't patients know
functioning better hyper focused yeah hyper focused exactly um no say
not much just dysfunctional need
find way try restore normal function areas not much directional
really um tend oversimplify brain function thinking directionality
much um unfortunately Imaging studies sometimes demonstrate activation
hypoactivation think kinds things can misconstrued
call cortical areas OCD dysregulated need
find way try normalize function uh frontal lobe huge areas
frontal lobe bit basal like ofc orbital frontal cortex
prefrontal cortex definitely consistently seem implicated patients OCD
projections subcortex basal ganglia like saying


caudi putamen dorsal striatum interconnected ventral
striatum area brain uh focus lot energy um
ventralstratum not limited includes nucleus accumbens area
brain know involved gating reward seeking behavior
perturbed seems gait compulsive Behavior meaning rat will pursue reward
despite punishment despite foot shock example can uh similar
OCD patient will um check home safety 3 A.M morning not
sleep night way similar rat seeking food reward uh despite
foot shock um something urge despite risk perhaps
normal judgment take risks function everyday
Society successful take risk take care patients surgery
risk make judgment call not condition just
normal judgment consistently sort puts us risk
something like OCD OCD also know one many conditions suffer
kinds problems tend label tend present
consistent way patients OCD hyper checking Behavior
contamination Behavior feel contaminated wash hands
hours repeatedly drop toothbrush floor will lead compulsive
behavior cleaning toothbrush brushing teeth consistently common
symptoms see signs patients report us observe
know patients eating disorders tend binging disorder
overeat bulimia might Purge despite risk things
um addiction similar tend drug seek addicted um uh
pay off dealer uh order get fix despite risk type urge
despite risk something always really interested
common denominator problems think

00:31:11 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

problems mean common conditions society today
like take quick break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic
greens now called ag-1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers
foundational nutritional needs taking athletic green since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens


reason still take athletic greens usually twice day gets
probiotics need gut health gut important populated gut
microbiota communicate brain immune system basically
biological systems body strongly impact immediate long-term health
probiotics athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health
addition athletic greens contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals
make sure foundational nutritional needs met tastes great
like try athletic greens can go athleticgreens.com huberman give
five free travel packs make really easy mix athletic greens
road car plane Etc give year's supply vitamin d3k2

00:32:27 Facial Vocal Ticks, Stimulants, Stress & Superstition

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2 really appreciate
building bridge OCD nucleus accumbens course
associated reward various forms get um share personal
anecdote form question college studying lot relied
caffeine stimulant never really drugs alcohol Lucky
sense don't drink care less alcohol disappeared never really liked recreational
drugs never drawn however college time
little epinephrine pills common lot sports supplements
like pre-workout type things yes not unlike energy drinks now completely
avoid um experience taking one drinking coffee
course gave lift energy similar amphetamine
legal counter time now either banned illegal not
recommend lot energy noticed grunting tick
came back made one mistake still think one mistake
um engage superstitious Behavior knocked wood somehow felt
rewarding like gave totally irrational internally rational sense
security around forget knocking wood found couldn't
break knock wood compulsion felt needed knock wood
started sneaking knock Woods like mid-exam studying pretty soon
knocking wood often developed superstition curious role


superstition compulsion crossover makes sense logically
equally shocked learn stopped taking stimulant quite
happy stop make feel alert couldn't sleep well Etc
Superstition went away well guessing something
reward circuitry called related stimulants not encouraging
anyone take stimulants although healthy use caffeine safe use caffeine might
one universally accepted stimulant um really surprising quickly
came quickly engaged thinking behavior obsessions
compulsions quickly turned off stopped taking Sports
stimulant whatever don't even remember think form
epinephrine ephedrine sure saw epinephrine excuse misspoke ephedrine um
described sound totally outside bounds uh logic imagining
um no happen certain happened yeah no don't think imagining
know grunting mentioned know first didn't
uh comment know sort not put label sounds like tick
know ticks young males extremely common tend go away
linking like since good friend actually famous neuroscientist won't
mention worked hard suppress blinking tits
gets fatigued comes back um high functioning yes personal
life professional life talking starts
kind start wondering like going yeah yeah unfortunate know
people problems especially get severe get Tourette
Syndrome know hard function society friends
Tourette tell just inspired um confident
know people obviously notice problems just live life
successful not typical um friends went
Penn undergrad kinds problems always just happy
inspired typical uh know problems cause
people lose confidence not know uh pursue know
profession may done um things nature think related
fact brains vulnerable get back question
stimulant know think think brain vulnerable know
sort may predisposition um mentioned little
obsessive tick maybe kind know


mild side spectrum OCD um probably well way also also
avoided drugs reason uh life drink little bit wine
um uh think people don't avoid things
see problems relation not just taking stimulant kind
environmental exposure Society causes much stress um
think human conditions human conditions try model
animals animals don't kinds problems know heard
can animal like monkey wild can depression monkey's
version depression don't think really typical human depression know
certainly not prevalent depression human society think know
haven't evolved manage stresses society currently
stimulants probably one know suspect probably little
bit vulnerable um possible stimulant led overdrive prefrontal
orbital frontal cortex even brought little OCD Behavior related super uh
Superstition um no believe entirely also think know
things like OCD kinds psychiatric disorders tend present
college people leave home school
stressed getting exposed things haven't exposed
outside home know brains aren't evolved sophisticated
enough yet help cope kinds stresses manifests
kinds conditions don't want put label conditions
certainly psychiatric disorder also just lots anxiety also
kind problems well um think nucleus accumbens
cortical areas discussing sort send projections
areas probably least one main circuits involved kinds
things relieved no longer present confess oh always feel close long
run helps move know slightly fatigued not overly fatigued slightly
fatigued seems move kind physical compulsion try channel um
never taken medication still still going may call
referral point

00:39:28 Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders & Obesity

sure point uh feeling okay um talk nucleus accumbens


reward circuitry relationship OCD reward addiction uh just give
sense headed realm food related eating
related uh behaviors disorders know important
work nucleus accumbens know one two um one
side brain roles play um healthy brain behavior
pathology yeah nucleus accumbens part brain part reward circuits
Hub reward circuits always fascinated um
scientists around world leading arguably leading scientists
world father addiction Neuroscience call um although tells
nuts Rob malenka studied nucleus accumbens since beginning
career worked Stanford um fabulous scientist Mentor
taught much um taught world much incredible person scientist phys
Physicians yes MD PhD uh brilliant ways um fatherly lot
way terms teaching people science good citizens
well um uh nucleus accumbens area also complicated
lot functions uh interconnects many parts brain um
things nucleus accumbens consistent uh
started getting interested reward surgeon try
improve manage Rewards mean specifically
urge reward normal phenomenon not something trying
stop issue urge reward either puts somebody else
risk probably reward shouldn't suppose say well depends
size reward size risk fits societal
Norms um example obese doctor advising
lose weight try control eating habits uh know perhaps better food
choices important way healthier not pursuing better
food choices urge probably need treat uh drug addict
use heroin opiate considering opiate crisis right now cocaine
untreatable moment uh know cocaine might make feel like
energy day deal work opiate might make
feel better life stressful risk things really high fact
potentially lethal uh urge treatable OCD can't
sleep night nervous didn't lock door
checked 30 times reality people severe OCD um urge


got treat eating disorder eating eating disorders obesity obviously
linked relationship patient food also quite distinct not
everybody obesity eating disorder obviously not everybody
eating disorder obesity particularly interested patients binge eating
disorder well obesity heavily linked not everybody
binging disorder obesity average overweight um
deep brain stimulation trial Penn trying modulate nucleus
accumbens understand better patients failed gastric bypass surgery
aggressive form treatment obesity believe failed
gastric bypass surgery binge eating disorder meaning just can't control
much eat obesity either related even due overeating not
predisposition um body habitus know obesity phenotype something
can see not everybody obese thing important
taught close mentor friend Tom wadden director
Obesity Center Penn center weight eating disorders said
know Casey uh know careful obesity interested addiction
understand interested addictive Tendencies certain patients
obesity uh uh relationship food not everybody obesity
problem fact probably present 20 patients obesity
now taking step back twenty percent patients obesity still massive
problem epidemic proportions perhaps patients either
form binging disorder say degree bingeing disorder uh
least loss control eating common um feature think
eating disorder experts obesity experts neurosurgeons obesity obesity medicine experts
agree common eating disorders obesity also believe
common addicts perhaps patients OCD sort loss control disorder
um actually not disorder known like DSM-5 diagnostic manual
feature say conditions common common denominator
believe can restored least problem can ameliorated improved upon
better understanding tailored treatment nucleus accumbens specifically
learned mice expose mouse now just model expose
mouse high fat food not food normally eat food like 60 fat high
fat like butter um learned expose food like within two
weeks nucleus accumbens not functioning like mouse never exposed


high fat food aspects hyperactive say
aspects hypoactive decreased activity either way not
functioning properly likely function predisposing continued behavior
probably eventually leads things like habit gets developed
whole nother area kinds problems complicated poorly
understood case just focus behavior hand seems
repeated exposure something like high fat food drug abuse type reward
really strong reward way can hijack normal functioning nucleus
accumbens goal invasive trial try restore normal functioning
nucleus accumbens uh mice seems signal predicts
going lose control can use signal deliver sort real-time therapy
form deep brain stimulation just brief amount stimulation actually
blocks behavior interesting time signal actually decreases
frequency suggests level restoring normal function circuit
mouse trying now

00:47:18 Stimulation Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation

human trial fascinating stimulation provided imagine
one stimulate nucleus accumbens see reinforcement whatever
Behavior coincided preceded stimulation stimulation brief delivery
stimulation anywhere 5 10 seconds intended just disrupt
perturbed signaling happening nucleus accumbens disorders like
depression say describe bit state disorder
obviously oversimplified know fluctuations mood
depression well don't let oversimplify much um um now
forgive oversimplification accept depression state disorder
maybe Parkinson's disease state disorder recognizing fluctuate uh
types problems likely not not definitely likely need continuous
therapy form therapy consistent uh perhaps therapy fluctuates
condition nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder OCD
addiction um binging disorder context obesity lot patients
functioning quite normally every single day just intermittently throughout day
brief interruptions normal functions thoughts


food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

00:08:28 Neurosurgeon’s View Brain, Neurosurgery Specialization

livemomentis.com huberman now discussion Dr Casey
Halpern Casey say Dr Halpern listening welcome thank great
yeah long time coming colleagues Stanford recently
moved course University Pennsylvania also incredible institution sorry
lose better sweet Stanford's loss upenn's gain um
talk work uh past present told listeners already
neurosurgeon consider astronauts Neuroscience
somewhat Uncharted Territory Uncharted Territory yet Precision
everything right margins error small aren't familiar
differences neurosurgery neurology Psychiatry just educate us
bit neurosurgeon fact nurse surgeon
view brain think conceptualize brain yeah
scope neurosurgery quite broad uh medical school drawn
neurosurgery procedure known deep brain stimulation
Penn college student actually watched first deep brain stimulation surgery
performed Gordon boltuck date one career mentors deep brain
stimulation one surgery neurosurgeons offer actually sort small
minority neurosurgery know take brain tumors clip
aneurysms brain take care patients traumatic brain injury
concussion spine surgeries ninety percent neurosurgeons around country
uh know taking care herniated discs lumbar fusions know scope
entire central nervous system include including peripheral nervous system
take care patients carpal tunnel syndrome nerve disorders now
course past two decades mission field sub-
specialize historically neurosurgeons everything domain now
sub-specialize lucky Penn Medicine can focus one
areas chief stereotactic functional Neurosurgery deep brain


stimulation surgery compliment focus ultrasound transcranial Focus
ultrasound non-invasive way ablation brain recently FDA
approved FDA approved Trevor moment uh two procedures
every day uh still minority neurosurgeons offer
majority neurosurgery mind bit structural physiology
deeply rooted brain functions take brain tumor find
safe trajectory get brain tumor remove help
patient recover ICU similar brain aneurysm often don't go
brain clip brain aneurysm go around brain brain get
mind surgeries bit structural deep brain stimulation
surgery routinely procedure yes structure involved course
place thin wire insulated deep part brain
involved Parkinson's disease example uh actually not therapy
therapy delivering electrical stimulation tip wire one tips
actually multiple contacts bottom wire small uh
done operating room know stimulation wire connected
battery pack pulse generator kind like pacemaker deliver
therapy always tell patients bit like implant uh tool
deliver medication medication going form electricity
going delivered small region brain procedure
inspired not just become

00:13:05 Deep Brain Stimulation & Unexpected Positive Effects

neurosurgeon really defined focus research laboratory well Maybe
way antidote tell us one outrageous surprising
knows um delightful thrilling things brain observed
consequence stimulating different brain areas know textbooks always hear
uh kind dark stuff know stimulate one brain area somebody goes
rage stimulate another brain area person starts laughing uncontrollably first um
given information hope not much information
textbooks incorrect sorts statements true can one observe
clinic interesting uh don't necessarily mean
entertaining um surprising things seen poked around


brain deliberately course uh seen heard
say amazed effects uh every day yeah privileged able
interact human brain way always goal trying
provide somebody meaningful therapy deliver electrical stimulation
know electrodes might sitting small region
brain regions within millimeters electrodes
stimulated cause temporary brief side effect moment laughter like
said moment panic course can just shut electrode off often
side effects therapeutic actually discovered ways
use deep brain stimulation not just movement disorders like Parkinson's disease
example patients Parkinson's disease psychiatric uh uh
comorbidity like depression obsessive-compulsive disorder lot patients
highly compulsive impulsive sometimes problems actually melt away
trying help Tremor patients also tell us gambling issue
gotten better mood improved well know probably
one reason know can help somebody's Mood making Tremor
go away course see laughter clinic sometimes
stimulating parts brain not just involved
motor circuits also involved call limbic circuit part brain
involved emotion learn modulate areas therapeutically step
step can actually develop therapies indications like depression
say impressive consistent effect patient
Tremor tremming past 20 years can deliver stimulation
electrode clinic immediate relief Tremor
effect inspired neurosurgeon college never really
wanted anything else X accept help develop type therapeutic another
another kind symptom interested obesity related Eating Disorders
compulsive Behavior urge uh something might delicious
dangerous unhealthy drug compulsion like see OCD pests
compulsive disorder uh interestingly like see Tremor melt away deliver
electricity certain part brain can see psychiatric psychiatric
problems not psychiatric disorders say disorders brain can
see symptoms disorders also improve often immediately just like
Tremor see time pick one uh challenge


everyday speed relief described
Tremor really um incredible just thinking drug therapies
side effects still lot mysteries instance ssris even work
work

00:17:20 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Prescriptions & Cognitive Therapies

timing always challenge timing dosage yes absolutely um love learn
OCD several reasons asking first
somewhat obsessive person tend narrowly focused although confess
not step function takes time turn off chatter
thought train mode uh thinking work hard exit
mode like deep Trench adaptive circumstances less adaptive
others know kid uh little bit grunting tick
used intense intense desire clear throat um point
dad said like need stop used squeeze hand every time
used hide back seat car closet provided
much relief eventually passed yes wasn't medicated never anything
every now fatigued working lot notice
starts come back like kind grunting sort like pet
neurological symptom reminds circuits exist us
sometimes go haywire sometimes just subtle um know
excitation something sort third reason get thousands
questions OCD perhaps just tell us OCD sure um
brain areas involved current range treatments
difference someone obsessive somebody true OCD
brief disclosure neurosurgeon take care patients severe obsessive-
compulsive disorder um perspective OCD may little bit different
psychiatrist lives breathes OCD sees patients every single day
OCD probably take care three five patients year deep brain stimulation
obsessive-compulsive disorders don't see patients routinely
laboratory geared researcher focused trying improve outcomes
deep brain stimulation OCD feel expertise perspective
share just brief disclosure feel neurosurgeon obligated


better understand obsessions brain come can
interrupt stop compulsion associated obsession sort
intrinsic feature OCD uh better actually example
offer patient Tremor deep brain stimulation surgery course
risk procedure outcome consistent positive many patients
willing take risk uh obsessive compulsion compulsive disorder
surgery risk however benefit not quite robust lot
patients referring psychiatrists reluctant refer patients us
completely understandable uh leading Endeavor number
collaborators around country try better understand circuits brain uh
study humans invasively non-invasively
electrode-based surgery sort like epilepsy understand seizures
come want understand better obsessions come also
working imaging experts geneticists understand OCD broader level
well uh consider OCD spectrum disorder way uh apologize
might feel using term incorrectly using way
describe patients obsessions even related compulsions might not
meet criteria OCD may something Andrew
neurosurgeon really obsessive safety compulsive surgical
procedures know think aspect OCD often joke
know consider seriously people suffer uh
aspect helps us know famous uh CEOs probably level
OCD uh surgeons scientists alike perhaps can controlled asset
uh goes awry uncontrollable becomes obsessive-compulsive
disorder tend see patients severe failed
medication multiple medications worth trying OCD can
actually helpful neurotransmitter systems tend poke well
ssris sort first line OCD also tricyclics can helpful still
serotonin system know serotonin system interacts know
neurogenergic system dopamine system hard specific one
things think also hard us predict medications
going work kinds patients tricyclics ssris can helpful
definitely first line others exposure response prevention uh
probably effective option kind like cognitive behavioral therapy


different offered psychologists whole field
field say whole clinic institution focused started Edna foa
Penn patients uh offer types cognitive
therapies exposure stressor try get patients habituate whatever
stresses causes uh compulsions help patients live every
day function fabulously helpful therapies variety patients
still 30 patients still suffer OCD severe
OCD sometimes moderate severe patients really
motivated try help um therapies patients right now say
worth pursuing not optimal um one things
balance researcher see patients like want
everything can help think important educate patients risks
benefits deep brain stimulation surgery also capsulotomy
ablation approach little bit like deep brain stimulation rather
delivering stimulation electrode can actually heat tissue even
destroy say part brain safe destroy kind like
appendix um others say safer modulate seen patients well
ablations know asked earlier find amazing
brain effects can sometimes lack effect
amazing can actually Traverse parts brain without adverse effects
patients function least can test can also destroy small parts
brain talking three four millimeters size little ablations can really
helpful patients no obvious side effects can tell perhaps short
recovery surgery nonetheless despite safe might surgical
procedures still surgical procedures patients hesitant perceived especially
know chance transformative effect quite low can generally
achieve responder rate 50 percent responders still symptomatic
OCD really uh sort inspired really find way deliver therapies
disease specific symptom-specific way years away probably


00:25:40 Brain Areas OCD, Risk, Rewards & Addiction

therapy since part research study moment brain areas


think think OCD years ago remember opening textbook think
undergraduate still work Judith Rappaport National Institutes
mental health late 80s early 90s um done neuroimaging
maybe pet Imaging technique identified portions
basal ganglia sure caudi putanum type structures OCD maybe differences
boys versus girls brain areas sex differences terms OCD
one come clinic know sort work ablations
stimulation uh first start probe brain yeah uh
disorder cortex Sub sub cortex uh cortical control areas areas
involved inhibitory control found not function properly patients
OCD areas like orbital frontal cortex prefrontal cortex image
areas study even rodent model OCD quite honestly models
model aspects OCD OCD human condition can't really model
whole condition mouse wrap perhaps can model compulsive
behavior rat sure pulling hair yeah exactly know not
necessarily obsessive compulsive disorder compulsive behavior perhaps
can ameliorate rat might helpful patient OCD
approach animal modeling OCD thoughtfully uh scientists
think uh study OCD models humans imaging
trying invasively electrodes like epilepsy patients find
areas cortex like prefrontal orbital frontal cortex not functioning
will way non-oc patient often hyper functioning uh
might say Well hyper functioning aren't patients know
functioning better hyper focused yeah hyper focused exactly um no say
not much just dysfunctional need
find way try restore normal function areas not much directional
really um tend oversimplify brain function thinking directionality
much um unfortunately Imaging studies sometimes demonstrate activation
hypoactivation think kinds things can misconstrued
call cortical areas OCD dysregulated need
find way try normalize function uh frontal lobe huge areas
frontal lobe bit basal like ofc orbital frontal cortex
prefrontal cortex definitely consistently seem implicated patients OCD
projections subcortex basal ganglia like saying


caudi putamen dorsal striatum interconnected ventral
striatum area brain uh focus lot energy um
ventralstratum not limited includes nucleus accumbens area
brain know involved gating reward seeking behavior
perturbed seems gait compulsive Behavior meaning rat will pursue reward
despite punishment despite foot shock example can uh similar
OCD patient will um check home safety 3 A.M morning not
sleep night way similar rat seeking food reward uh despite
foot shock um something urge despite risk perhaps
normal judgment take risks function everyday
Society successful take risk take care patients surgery
risk make judgment call not condition just
normal judgment consistently sort puts us risk
something like OCD OCD also know one many conditions suffer
kinds problems tend label tend present
consistent way patients OCD hyper checking Behavior
contamination Behavior feel contaminated wash hands
hours repeatedly drop toothbrush floor will lead compulsive
behavior cleaning toothbrush brushing teeth consistently common
symptoms see signs patients report us observe
know patients eating disorders tend binging disorder
overeat bulimia might Purge despite risk things
um addiction similar tend drug seek addicted um uh
pay off dealer uh order get fix despite risk type urge
despite risk something always really interested
common denominator problems think

00:31:11 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

problems mean common conditions society today
like take quick break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic
greens now called ag-1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers
foundational nutritional needs taking athletic green since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens


reason still take athletic greens usually twice day gets
probiotics need gut health gut important populated gut
microbiota communicate brain immune system basically
biological systems body strongly impact immediate long-term health
probiotics athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health
addition athletic greens contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals
make sure foundational nutritional needs met tastes great
like try athletic greens can go athleticgreens.com huberman give
five free travel packs make really easy mix athletic greens
road car plane Etc give year's supply vitamin d3k2

00:32:27 Facial Vocal Ticks, Stimulants, Stress & Superstition

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2 really appreciate
building bridge OCD nucleus accumbens course
associated reward various forms get um share personal
anecdote form question college studying lot relied
caffeine stimulant never really drugs alcohol Lucky
sense don't drink care less alcohol disappeared never really liked recreational
drugs never drawn however college time
little epinephrine pills common lot sports supplements
like pre-workout type things yes not unlike energy drinks now completely
avoid um experience taking one drinking coffee
course gave lift energy similar amphetamine
legal counter time now either banned illegal not
recommend lot energy noticed grunting tick
came back made one mistake still think one mistake
um engage superstitious Behavior knocked wood somehow felt
rewarding like gave totally irrational internally rational sense
security around forget knocking wood found couldn't
break knock wood compulsion felt needed knock wood
started sneaking knock Woods like mid-exam studying pretty soon
knocking wood often developed superstition curious role


superstition compulsion crossover makes sense logically
equally shocked learn stopped taking stimulant quite
happy stop make feel alert couldn't sleep well Etc
Superstition went away well guessing something
reward circuitry called related stimulants not encouraging
anyone take stimulants although healthy use caffeine safe use caffeine might
one universally accepted stimulant um really surprising quickly
came quickly engaged thinking behavior obsessions
compulsions quickly turned off stopped taking Sports
stimulant whatever don't even remember think form
epinephrine ephedrine sure saw epinephrine excuse misspoke ephedrine um
described sound totally outside bounds uh logic imagining
um no happen certain happened yeah no don't think imagining
know grunting mentioned know first didn't
uh comment know sort not put label sounds like tick
know ticks young males extremely common tend go away
linking like since good friend actually famous neuroscientist won't
mention worked hard suppress blinking tits
gets fatigued comes back um high functioning yes personal
life professional life talking starts
kind start wondering like going yeah yeah unfortunate know
people problems especially get severe get Tourette
Syndrome know hard function society friends
Tourette tell just inspired um confident
know people obviously notice problems just live life
successful not typical um friends went
Penn undergrad kinds problems always just happy
inspired typical uh know problems cause
people lose confidence not know uh pursue know
profession may done um things nature think related
fact brains vulnerable get back question
stimulant know think think brain vulnerable know
sort may predisposition um mentioned little
obsessive tick maybe kind know


mild side spectrum OCD um probably well way also also
avoided drugs reason uh life drink little bit wine
um uh think people don't avoid things
see problems relation not just taking stimulant kind
environmental exposure Society causes much stress um
think human conditions human conditions try model
animals animals don't kinds problems know heard
can animal like monkey wild can depression monkey's
version depression don't think really typical human depression know
certainly not prevalent depression human society think know
haven't evolved manage stresses society currently
stimulants probably one know suspect probably little
bit vulnerable um possible stimulant led overdrive prefrontal
orbital frontal cortex even brought little OCD Behavior related super uh
Superstition um no believe entirely also think know
things like OCD kinds psychiatric disorders tend present
college people leave home school
stressed getting exposed things haven't exposed
outside home know brains aren't evolved sophisticated
enough yet help cope kinds stresses manifests
kinds conditions don't want put label conditions
certainly psychiatric disorder also just lots anxiety also
kind problems well um think nucleus accumbens
cortical areas discussing sort send projections
areas probably least one main circuits involved kinds
things relieved no longer present confess oh always feel close long
run helps move know slightly fatigued not overly fatigued slightly
fatigued seems move kind physical compulsion try channel um
never taken medication still still going may call
referral point

00:39:28 Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders & Obesity

sure point uh feeling okay um talk nucleus accumbens


reward circuitry relationship OCD reward addiction uh just give
sense headed realm food related eating
related uh behaviors disorders know important
work nucleus accumbens know one two um one
side brain roles play um healthy brain behavior
pathology yeah nucleus accumbens part brain part reward circuits
Hub reward circuits always fascinated um
scientists around world leading arguably leading scientists
world father addiction Neuroscience call um although tells
nuts Rob malenka studied nucleus accumbens since beginning
career worked Stanford um fabulous scientist Mentor
taught much um taught world much incredible person scientist phys
Physicians yes MD PhD uh brilliant ways um fatherly lot
way terms teaching people science good citizens
well um uh nucleus accumbens area also complicated
lot functions uh interconnects many parts brain um
things nucleus accumbens consistent uh
started getting interested reward surgeon try
improve manage Rewards mean specifically
urge reward normal phenomenon not something trying
stop issue urge reward either puts somebody else
risk probably reward shouldn't suppose say well depends
size reward size risk fits societal
Norms um example obese doctor advising
lose weight try control eating habits uh know perhaps better food
choices important way healthier not pursuing better
food choices urge probably need treat uh drug addict
use heroin opiate considering opiate crisis right now cocaine
untreatable moment uh know cocaine might make feel like
energy day deal work opiate might make
feel better life stressful risk things really high fact
potentially lethal uh urge treatable OCD can't
sleep night nervous didn't lock door
checked 30 times reality people severe OCD um urge


got treat eating disorder eating eating disorders obesity obviously
linked relationship patient food also quite distinct not
everybody obesity eating disorder obviously not everybody
eating disorder obesity particularly interested patients binge eating
disorder well obesity heavily linked not everybody
binging disorder obesity average overweight um
deep brain stimulation trial Penn trying modulate nucleus
accumbens understand better patients failed gastric bypass surgery
aggressive form treatment obesity believe failed
gastric bypass surgery binge eating disorder meaning just can't control
much eat obesity either related even due overeating not
predisposition um body habitus know obesity phenotype something
can see not everybody obese thing important
taught close mentor friend Tom wadden director
Obesity Center Penn center weight eating disorders said
know Casey uh know careful obesity interested addiction
understand interested addictive Tendencies certain patients
obesity uh uh relationship food not everybody obesity
problem fact probably present 20 patients obesity
now taking step back twenty percent patients obesity still massive
problem epidemic proportions perhaps patients either
form binging disorder say degree bingeing disorder uh
least loss control eating common um feature think
eating disorder experts obesity experts neurosurgeons obesity obesity medicine experts
agree common eating disorders obesity also believe
common addicts perhaps patients OCD sort loss control disorder
um actually not disorder known like DSM-5 diagnostic manual
feature say conditions common common denominator
believe can restored least problem can ameliorated improved upon
better understanding tailored treatment nucleus accumbens specifically
learned mice expose mouse now just model expose
mouse high fat food not food normally eat food like 60 fat high
fat like butter um learned expose food like within two
weeks nucleus accumbens not functioning like mouse never exposed


high fat food aspects hyperactive say
aspects hypoactive decreased activity either way not
functioning properly likely function predisposing continued behavior
probably eventually leads things like habit gets developed
whole nother area kinds problems complicated poorly
understood case just focus behavior hand seems
repeated exposure something like high fat food drug abuse type reward
really strong reward way can hijack normal functioning nucleus
accumbens goal invasive trial try restore normal functioning
nucleus accumbens uh mice seems signal predicts
going lose control can use signal deliver sort real-time therapy
form deep brain stimulation just brief amount stimulation actually
blocks behavior interesting time signal actually decreases
frequency suggests level restoring normal function circuit
mouse trying now

00:47:18 Stimulation Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation

human trial fascinating stimulation provided imagine
one stimulate nucleus accumbens see reinforcement whatever
Behavior coincided preceded stimulation stimulation brief delivery
stimulation anywhere 5 10 seconds intended just disrupt
perturbed signaling happening nucleus accumbens disorders like
depression say describe bit state disorder
obviously oversimplified know fluctuations mood
depression well don't let oversimplify much um um now
forgive oversimplification accept depression state disorder
maybe Parkinson's disease state disorder recognizing fluctuate uh
types problems likely not not definitely likely need continuous
therapy form therapy consistent uh perhaps therapy fluctuates
condition nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder OCD
addiction um binging disorder context obesity lot patients
functioning quite normally every single day just intermittently throughout day
brief interruptions normal functions thoughts


food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

00:08:28 Neurosurgeon’s View Brain, Neurosurgery Specialization

livemomentis.com huberman now discussion Dr Casey
Halpern Casey say Dr Halpern listening welcome thank great
yeah long time coming colleagues Stanford recently
moved course University Pennsylvania also incredible institution sorry
lose better sweet Stanford's loss upenn's gain um
talk work uh past present told listeners already
neurosurgeon consider astronauts Neuroscience
somewhat Uncharted Territory Uncharted Territory yet Precision
everything right margins error small aren't familiar
differences neurosurgery neurology Psychiatry just educate us
bit neurosurgeon fact nurse surgeon
view brain think conceptualize brain yeah
scope neurosurgery quite broad uh medical school drawn
neurosurgery procedure known deep brain stimulation
Penn college student actually watched first deep brain stimulation surgery
performed Gordon boltuck date one career mentors deep brain
stimulation one surgery neurosurgeons offer actually sort small
minority neurosurgery know take brain tumors clip
aneurysms brain take care patients traumatic brain injury
concussion spine surgeries ninety percent neurosurgeons around country
uh know taking care herniated discs lumbar fusions know scope
entire central nervous system include including peripheral nervous system
take care patients carpal tunnel syndrome nerve disorders now
course past two decades mission field sub-
specialize historically neurosurgeons everything domain now
sub-specialize lucky Penn Medicine can focus one
areas chief stereotactic functional Neurosurgery deep brain


stimulation surgery compliment focus ultrasound transcranial Focus
ultrasound non-invasive way ablation brain recently FDA
approved FDA approved Trevor moment uh two procedures
every day uh still minority neurosurgeons offer
majority neurosurgery mind bit structural physiology
deeply rooted brain functions take brain tumor find
safe trajectory get brain tumor remove help
patient recover ICU similar brain aneurysm often don't go
brain clip brain aneurysm go around brain brain get
mind surgeries bit structural deep brain stimulation
surgery routinely procedure yes structure involved course
place thin wire insulated deep part brain
involved Parkinson's disease example uh actually not therapy
therapy delivering electrical stimulation tip wire one tips
actually multiple contacts bottom wire small uh
done operating room know stimulation wire connected
battery pack pulse generator kind like pacemaker deliver
therapy always tell patients bit like implant uh tool
deliver medication medication going form electricity
going delivered small region brain procedure
inspired not just become

00:13:05 Deep Brain Stimulation & Unexpected Positive Effects

neurosurgeon really defined focus research laboratory well Maybe
way antidote tell us one outrageous surprising
knows um delightful thrilling things brain observed
consequence stimulating different brain areas know textbooks always hear
uh kind dark stuff know stimulate one brain area somebody goes
rage stimulate another brain area person starts laughing uncontrollably first um
given information hope not much information
textbooks incorrect sorts statements true can one observe
clinic interesting uh don't necessarily mean
entertaining um surprising things seen poked around


brain deliberately course uh seen heard
say amazed effects uh every day yeah privileged able
interact human brain way always goal trying
provide somebody meaningful therapy deliver electrical stimulation
know electrodes might sitting small region
brain regions within millimeters electrodes
stimulated cause temporary brief side effect moment laughter like
said moment panic course can just shut electrode off often
side effects therapeutic actually discovered ways
use deep brain stimulation not just movement disorders like Parkinson's disease
example patients Parkinson's disease psychiatric uh uh
comorbidity like depression obsessive-compulsive disorder lot patients
highly compulsive impulsive sometimes problems actually melt away
trying help Tremor patients also tell us gambling issue
gotten better mood improved well know probably
one reason know can help somebody's Mood making Tremor
go away course see laughter clinic sometimes
stimulating parts brain not just involved
motor circuits also involved call limbic circuit part brain
involved emotion learn modulate areas therapeutically step
step can actually develop therapies indications like depression
say impressive consistent effect patient
Tremor tremming past 20 years can deliver stimulation
electrode clinic immediate relief Tremor
effect inspired neurosurgeon college never really
wanted anything else X accept help develop type therapeutic another
another kind symptom interested obesity related Eating Disorders
compulsive Behavior urge uh something might delicious
dangerous unhealthy drug compulsion like see OCD pests
compulsive disorder uh interestingly like see Tremor melt away deliver
electricity certain part brain can see psychiatric psychiatric
problems not psychiatric disorders say disorders brain can
see symptoms disorders also improve often immediately just like
Tremor see time pick one uh challenge


everyday speed relief described
Tremor really um incredible just thinking drug therapies
side effects still lot mysteries instance ssris even work
work

00:17:20 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Prescriptions & Cognitive Therapies

timing always challenge timing dosage yes absolutely um love learn
OCD several reasons asking first
somewhat obsessive person tend narrowly focused although confess
not step function takes time turn off chatter
thought train mode uh thinking work hard exit
mode like deep Trench adaptive circumstances less adaptive
others know kid uh little bit grunting tick
used intense intense desire clear throat um point
dad said like need stop used squeeze hand every time
used hide back seat car closet provided
much relief eventually passed yes wasn't medicated never anything
every now fatigued working lot notice
starts come back like kind grunting sort like pet
neurological symptom reminds circuits exist us
sometimes go haywire sometimes just subtle um know
excitation something sort third reason get thousands
questions OCD perhaps just tell us OCD sure um
brain areas involved current range treatments
difference someone obsessive somebody true OCD
brief disclosure neurosurgeon take care patients severe obsessive-
compulsive disorder um perspective OCD may little bit different
psychiatrist lives breathes OCD sees patients every single day
OCD probably take care three five patients year deep brain stimulation
obsessive-compulsive disorders don't see patients routinely
laboratory geared researcher focused trying improve outcomes
deep brain stimulation OCD feel expertise perspective
share just brief disclosure feel neurosurgeon obligated


better understand obsessions brain come can
interrupt stop compulsion associated obsession sort
intrinsic feature OCD uh better actually example
offer patient Tremor deep brain stimulation surgery course
risk procedure outcome consistent positive many patients
willing take risk uh obsessive compulsion compulsive disorder
surgery risk however benefit not quite robust lot
patients referring psychiatrists reluctant refer patients us
completely understandable uh leading Endeavor number
collaborators around country try better understand circuits brain uh
study humans invasively non-invasively
electrode-based surgery sort like epilepsy understand seizures
come want understand better obsessions come also
working imaging experts geneticists understand OCD broader level
well uh consider OCD spectrum disorder way uh apologize
might feel using term incorrectly using way
describe patients obsessions even related compulsions might not
meet criteria OCD may something Andrew
neurosurgeon really obsessive safety compulsive surgical
procedures know think aspect OCD often joke
know consider seriously people suffer uh
aspect helps us know famous uh CEOs probably level
OCD uh surgeons scientists alike perhaps can controlled asset
uh goes awry uncontrollable becomes obsessive-compulsive
disorder tend see patients severe failed
medication multiple medications worth trying OCD can
actually helpful neurotransmitter systems tend poke well
ssris sort first line OCD also tricyclics can helpful still
serotonin system know serotonin system interacts know
neurogenergic system dopamine system hard specific one
things think also hard us predict medications
going work kinds patients tricyclics ssris can helpful
definitely first line others exposure response prevention uh
probably effective option kind like cognitive behavioral therapy


different offered psychologists whole field
field say whole clinic institution focused started Edna foa
Penn patients uh offer types cognitive
therapies exposure stressor try get patients habituate whatever
stresses causes uh compulsions help patients live every
day function fabulously helpful therapies variety patients
still 30 patients still suffer OCD severe
OCD sometimes moderate severe patients really
motivated try help um therapies patients right now say
worth pursuing not optimal um one things
balance researcher see patients like want
everything can help think important educate patients risks
benefits deep brain stimulation surgery also capsulotomy
ablation approach little bit like deep brain stimulation rather
delivering stimulation electrode can actually heat tissue even
destroy say part brain safe destroy kind like
appendix um others say safer modulate seen patients well
ablations know asked earlier find amazing
brain effects can sometimes lack effect
amazing can actually Traverse parts brain without adverse effects
patients function least can test can also destroy small parts
brain talking three four millimeters size little ablations can really
helpful patients no obvious side effects can tell perhaps short
recovery surgery nonetheless despite safe might surgical
procedures still surgical procedures patients hesitant perceived especially
know chance transformative effect quite low can generally
achieve responder rate 50 percent responders still symptomatic
OCD really uh sort inspired really find way deliver therapies
disease specific symptom-specific way years away probably


00:25:40 Brain Areas OCD, Risk, Rewards & Addiction

therapy since part research study moment brain areas


think think OCD years ago remember opening textbook think
undergraduate still work Judith Rappaport National Institutes
mental health late 80s early 90s um done neuroimaging
maybe pet Imaging technique identified portions
basal ganglia sure caudi putanum type structures OCD maybe differences
boys versus girls brain areas sex differences terms OCD
one come clinic know sort work ablations
stimulation uh first start probe brain yeah uh
disorder cortex Sub sub cortex uh cortical control areas areas
involved inhibitory control found not function properly patients
OCD areas like orbital frontal cortex prefrontal cortex image
areas study even rodent model OCD quite honestly models
model aspects OCD OCD human condition can't really model
whole condition mouse wrap perhaps can model compulsive
behavior rat sure pulling hair yeah exactly know not
necessarily obsessive compulsive disorder compulsive behavior perhaps
can ameliorate rat might helpful patient OCD
approach animal modeling OCD thoughtfully uh scientists
think uh study OCD models humans imaging
trying invasively electrodes like epilepsy patients find
areas cortex like prefrontal orbital frontal cortex not functioning
will way non-oc patient often hyper functioning uh
might say Well hyper functioning aren't patients know
functioning better hyper focused yeah hyper focused exactly um no say
not much just dysfunctional need
find way try restore normal function areas not much directional
really um tend oversimplify brain function thinking directionality
much um unfortunately Imaging studies sometimes demonstrate activation
hypoactivation think kinds things can misconstrued
call cortical areas OCD dysregulated need
find way try normalize function uh frontal lobe huge areas
frontal lobe bit basal like ofc orbital frontal cortex
prefrontal cortex definitely consistently seem implicated patients OCD
projections subcortex basal ganglia like saying


caudi putamen dorsal striatum interconnected ventral
striatum area brain uh focus lot energy um
ventralstratum not limited includes nucleus accumbens area
brain know involved gating reward seeking behavior
perturbed seems gait compulsive Behavior meaning rat will pursue reward
despite punishment despite foot shock example can uh similar
OCD patient will um check home safety 3 A.M morning not
sleep night way similar rat seeking food reward uh despite
foot shock um something urge despite risk perhaps
normal judgment take risks function everyday
Society successful take risk take care patients surgery
risk make judgment call not condition just
normal judgment consistently sort puts us risk
something like OCD OCD also know one many conditions suffer
kinds problems tend label tend present
consistent way patients OCD hyper checking Behavior
contamination Behavior feel contaminated wash hands
hours repeatedly drop toothbrush floor will lead compulsive
behavior cleaning toothbrush brushing teeth consistently common
symptoms see signs patients report us observe
know patients eating disorders tend binging disorder
overeat bulimia might Purge despite risk things
um addiction similar tend drug seek addicted um uh
pay off dealer uh order get fix despite risk type urge
despite risk something always really interested
common denominator problems think

00:31:11 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

problems mean common conditions society today
like take quick break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic
greens now called ag-1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers
foundational nutritional needs taking athletic green since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens


reason still take athletic greens usually twice day gets
probiotics need gut health gut important populated gut
microbiota communicate brain immune system basically
biological systems body strongly impact immediate long-term health
probiotics athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health
addition athletic greens contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals
make sure foundational nutritional needs met tastes great

00:32:27 Facial Vocal Ticks, Stimulants, Stress & Superstition

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2 really appreciate
building bridge OCD nucleus accumbens course
associated reward various forms get um share personal
anecdote form question college studying lot relied
caffeine stimulant never really drugs alcohol Lucky
sense don't drink care less alcohol disappeared never really liked recreational
drugs never drawn however college time
little epinephrine pills common lot sports supplements
like pre-workout type things yes not unlike energy drinks now completely
avoid um experience taking one drinking coffee
course gave lift energy similar amphetamine
legal counter time now either banned illegal not
recommend lot energy noticed grunting tick
came back made one mistake still think one mistake
um engage superstitious Behavior knocked wood somehow felt
rewarding like gave totally irrational internally rational sense
security around forget knocking wood found couldn't
break knock wood compulsion felt needed knock wood
started sneaking knock Woods like mid-exam studying pretty soon
knocking wood often developed superstition curious role


superstition compulsion crossover makes sense logically
equally shocked learn stopped taking stimulant quite
happy stop make feel alert couldn't sleep well Etc
Superstition went away well guessing something
reward circuitry called related stimulants not encouraging
anyone take stimulants although healthy use caffeine safe use caffeine might
one universally accepted stimulant um really surprising quickly
came quickly engaged thinking behavior obsessions
compulsions quickly turned off stopped taking Sports
stimulant whatever don't even remember think form
epinephrine ephedrine sure saw epinephrine excuse misspoke ephedrine um
described sound totally outside bounds uh logic imagining
um no happen certain happened yeah no don't think imagining
know grunting mentioned know first didn't
uh comment know sort not put label sounds like tick
know ticks young males extremely common tend go away
linking like since good friend actually famous neuroscientist won't
mention worked hard suppress blinking tits
gets fatigued comes back um high functioning yes personal
life professional life talking starts
kind start wondering like going yeah yeah unfortunate know
people problems especially get severe get Tourette
Syndrome know hard function society friends
Tourette tell just inspired um confident
know people obviously notice problems just live life
successful not typical um friends went
Penn undergrad kinds problems always just happy
inspired typical uh know problems cause
people lose confidence not know uh pursue know
profession may done um things nature think related
fact brains vulnerable get back question
stimulant know think think brain vulnerable know
sort may predisposition um mentioned little
obsessive tick maybe kind know


mild side spectrum OCD um probably well way also also
avoided drugs reason uh life drink little bit wine
um uh think people don't avoid things
see problems relation not just taking stimulant kind
environmental exposure Society causes much stress um
think human conditions human conditions try model
animals animals don't kinds problems know heard
can animal like monkey wild can depression monkey's
version depression don't think really typical human depression know
certainly not prevalent depression human society think know
haven't evolved manage stresses society currently
stimulants probably one know suspect probably little
bit vulnerable um possible stimulant led overdrive prefrontal
orbital frontal cortex even brought little OCD Behavior related super uh
Superstition um no believe entirely also think know
things like OCD kinds psychiatric disorders tend present
college people leave home school
stressed getting exposed things haven't exposed
outside home know brains aren't evolved sophisticated
enough yet help cope kinds stresses manifests
kinds conditions don't want put label conditions
certainly psychiatric disorder also just lots anxiety also
kind problems well um think nucleus accumbens
cortical areas discussing sort send projections
areas probably least one main circuits involved kinds
things relieved no longer present confess oh always feel close long
run helps move know slightly fatigued not overly fatigued slightly
fatigued seems move kind physical compulsion try channel um
never taken medication still still going may call
referral point

00:39:28 Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders & Obesity

sure point uh feeling okay um talk nucleus accumbens


reward circuitry relationship OCD reward addiction uh just give
sense headed realm food related eating
related uh behaviors disorders know important
work nucleus accumbens know one two um one
side brain roles play um healthy brain behavior
pathology yeah nucleus accumbens part brain part reward circuits
Hub reward circuits always fascinated um
scientists around world leading arguably leading scientists
world father addiction Neuroscience call um although tells
nuts Rob malenka studied nucleus accumbens since beginning
career worked Stanford um fabulous scientist Mentor
taught much um taught world much incredible person scientist phys
Physicians yes MD PhD uh brilliant ways um fatherly lot
way terms teaching people science good citizens
well um uh nucleus accumbens area also complicated
lot functions uh interconnects many parts brain um
things nucleus accumbens consistent uh
started getting interested reward surgeon try
improve manage Rewards mean specifically
urge reward normal phenomenon not something trying
stop issue urge reward either puts somebody else
risk probably reward shouldn't suppose say well depends
size reward size risk fits societal
Norms um example obese doctor advising
lose weight try control eating habits uh know perhaps better food
choices important way healthier not pursuing better
food choices urge probably need treat uh drug addict
use heroin opiate considering opiate crisis right now cocaine
untreatable moment uh know cocaine might make feel like
energy day deal work opiate might make
feel better life stressful risk things really high fact
potentially lethal uh urge treatable OCD can't
sleep night nervous didn't lock door
checked 30 times reality people severe OCD um urge


got treat eating disorder eating eating disorders obesity obviously
linked relationship patient food also quite distinct not
everybody obesity eating disorder obviously not everybody
eating disorder obesity particularly interested patients binge eating
disorder well obesity heavily linked not everybody
binging disorder obesity average overweight um
deep brain stimulation trial Penn trying modulate nucleus
accumbens understand better patients failed gastric bypass surgery
aggressive form treatment obesity believe failed
gastric bypass surgery binge eating disorder meaning just can't control
much eat obesity either related even due overeating not
predisposition um body habitus know obesity phenotype something
can see not everybody obese thing important
taught close mentor friend Tom wadden director
Obesity Center Penn center weight eating disorders said
know Casey uh know careful obesity interested addiction
understand interested addictive Tendencies certain patients
obesity uh uh relationship food not everybody obesity
problem fact probably present 20 patients obesity
now taking step back twenty percent patients obesity still massive
problem epidemic proportions perhaps patients either
form binging disorder say degree bingeing disorder uh
least loss control eating common um feature think
eating disorder experts obesity experts neurosurgeons obesity obesity medicine experts
agree common eating disorders obesity also believe
common addicts perhaps patients OCD sort loss control disorder
um actually not disorder known like DSM-5 diagnostic manual
feature say conditions common common denominator
believe can restored least problem can ameliorated improved upon
better understanding tailored treatment nucleus accumbens specifically
learned mice expose mouse now just model expose
mouse high fat food not food normally eat food like 60 fat high
fat like butter um learned expose food like within two
weeks nucleus accumbens not functioning like mouse never exposed


high fat food aspects hyperactive say
aspects hypoactive decreased activity either way not
functioning properly likely function predisposing continued behavior
probably eventually leads things like habit gets developed
whole nother area kinds problems complicated poorly
understood case just focus behavior hand seems
repeated exposure something like high fat food drug abuse type reward
really strong reward way can hijack normal functioning nucleus
accumbens goal invasive trial try restore normal functioning
nucleus accumbens uh mice seems signal predicts
going lose control can use signal deliver sort real-time therapy
form deep brain stimulation just brief amount stimulation actually
blocks behavior interesting time signal actually decreases
frequency suggests level restoring normal function circuit
mouse trying now

00:47:18 Stimulation Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation

human trial fascinating stimulation provided imagine
one stimulate nucleus accumbens see reinforcement whatever
Behavior coincided preceded stimulation stimulation brief delivery
stimulation anywhere 5 10 seconds intended just disrupt
perturbed signaling happening nucleus accumbens disorders like
depression say describe bit state disorder
obviously oversimplified know fluctuations mood
depression well don't let oversimplify much um um now
forgive oversimplification accept depression state disorder
maybe Parkinson's disease state disorder recognizing fluctuate uh
types problems likely not not definitely likely need continuous
therapy form therapy consistent uh perhaps therapy fluctuates
condition nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder OCD
addiction um binging disorder context obesity lot patients
functioning quite normally every single day just intermittently throughout day
brief interruptions normal functions thoughts


food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

stimulation surgery compliment focus ultrasound transcranial Focus
ultrasound non-invasive way ablation brain recently FDA
approved FDA approved Trevor moment uh two procedures
every day uh still minority neurosurgeons offer
majority neurosurgery mind bit structural physiology
deeply rooted brain functions take brain tumor find
safe trajectory get brain tumor remove help
patient recover ICU similar brain aneurysm often don't go
brain clip brain aneurysm go around brain brain get
mind surgeries bit structural deep brain stimulation
surgery routinely procedure yes structure involved course
place thin wire insulated deep part brain
involved Parkinson's disease example uh actually not therapy
therapy delivering electrical stimulation tip wire one tips
actually multiple contacts bottom wire small uh
done operating room know stimulation wire connected
battery pack pulse generator kind like pacemaker deliver
therapy always tell patients bit like implant uh tool
deliver medication medication going form electricity
going delivered small region brain procedure
inspired not just become

00:13:05 Deep Brain Stimulation & Unexpected Positive Effects

neurosurgeon really defined focus research laboratory well Maybe
way antidote tell us one outrageous surprising
knows um delightful thrilling things brain observed
consequence stimulating different brain areas know textbooks always hear
uh kind dark stuff know stimulate one brain area somebody goes
rage stimulate another brain area person starts laughing uncontrollably first um
given information hope not much information
textbooks incorrect sorts statements true can one observe
clinic interesting uh don't necessarily mean
entertaining um surprising things seen poked around


brain deliberately course uh seen heard
say amazed effects uh every day yeah privileged able
interact human brain way always goal trying
provide somebody meaningful therapy deliver electrical stimulation
know electrodes might sitting small region
brain regions within millimeters electrodes
stimulated cause temporary brief side effect moment laughter like
said moment panic course can just shut electrode off often
side effects therapeutic actually discovered ways
use deep brain stimulation not just movement disorders like Parkinson's disease
example patients Parkinson's disease psychiatric uh uh
comorbidity like depression obsessive-compulsive disorder lot patients
highly compulsive impulsive sometimes problems actually melt away
trying help Tremor patients also tell us gambling issue
gotten better mood improved well know probably
one reason know can help somebody's Mood making Tremor
go away course see laughter clinic sometimes
stimulating parts brain not just involved
motor circuits also involved call limbic circuit part brain
involved emotion learn modulate areas therapeutically step
step can actually develop therapies indications like depression
say impressive consistent effect patient
Tremor tremming past 20 years can deliver stimulation
electrode clinic immediate relief Tremor
effect inspired neurosurgeon college never really
wanted anything else X accept help develop type therapeutic another
another kind symptom interested obesity related Eating Disorders
compulsive Behavior urge uh something might delicious
dangerous unhealthy drug compulsion like see OCD pests
compulsive disorder uh interestingly like see Tremor melt away deliver
electricity certain part brain can see psychiatric psychiatric
problems not psychiatric disorders say disorders brain can
see symptoms disorders also improve often immediately just like
Tremor see time pick one uh challenge


everyday speed relief described
Tremor really um incredible just thinking drug therapies
side effects still lot mysteries instance ssris even work
work

00:17:20 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Prescriptions & Cognitive Therapies

timing always challenge timing dosage yes absolutely um love learn
OCD several reasons asking first
somewhat obsessive person tend narrowly focused although confess
not step function takes time turn off chatter
thought train mode uh thinking work hard exit
mode like deep Trench adaptive circumstances less adaptive
others know kid uh little bit grunting tick
used intense intense desire clear throat um point
dad said like need stop used squeeze hand every time
used hide back seat car closet provided
much relief eventually passed yes wasn't medicated never anything
every now fatigued working lot notice
starts come back like kind grunting sort like pet
neurological symptom reminds circuits exist us
sometimes go haywire sometimes just subtle um know
excitation something sort third reason get thousands
questions OCD perhaps just tell us OCD sure um
brain areas involved current range treatments
difference someone obsessive somebody true OCD
brief disclosure neurosurgeon take care patients severe obsessive-
compulsive disorder um perspective OCD may little bit different
psychiatrist lives breathes OCD sees patients every single day
OCD probably take care three five patients year deep brain stimulation
obsessive-compulsive disorders don't see patients routinely
laboratory geared researcher focused trying improve outcomes
deep brain stimulation OCD feel expertise perspective
share just brief disclosure feel neurosurgeon obligated


better understand obsessions brain come can
interrupt stop compulsion associated obsession sort
intrinsic feature OCD uh better actually example
offer patient Tremor deep brain stimulation surgery course
risk procedure outcome consistent positive many patients
willing take risk uh obsessive compulsion compulsive disorder
surgery risk however benefit not quite robust lot
patients referring psychiatrists reluctant refer patients us
completely understandable uh leading Endeavor number
collaborators around country try better understand circuits brain uh
study humans invasively non-invasively
electrode-based surgery sort like epilepsy understand seizures
come want understand better obsessions come also
working imaging experts geneticists understand OCD broader level
well uh consider OCD spectrum disorder way uh apologize
might feel using term incorrectly using way
describe patients obsessions even related compulsions might not
meet criteria OCD may something Andrew
neurosurgeon really obsessive safety compulsive surgical
procedures know think aspect OCD often joke
know consider seriously people suffer uh
aspect helps us know famous uh CEOs probably level
OCD uh surgeons scientists alike perhaps can controlled asset
uh goes awry uncontrollable becomes obsessive-compulsive
disorder tend see patients severe failed
medication multiple medications worth trying OCD can
actually helpful neurotransmitter systems tend poke well
ssris sort first line OCD also tricyclics can helpful still
serotonin system know serotonin system interacts know
neurogenergic system dopamine system hard specific one
things think also hard us predict medications
going work kinds patients tricyclics ssris can helpful
definitely first line others exposure response prevention uh
probably effective option kind like cognitive behavioral therapy


different offered psychologists whole field
field say whole clinic institution focused started Edna foa
Penn patients uh offer types cognitive
therapies exposure stressor try get patients habituate whatever
stresses causes uh compulsions help patients live every
day function fabulously helpful therapies variety patients
still 30 patients still suffer OCD severe
OCD sometimes moderate severe patients really
motivated try help um therapies patients right now say
worth pursuing not optimal um one things
balance researcher see patients like want
everything can help think important educate patients risks
benefits deep brain stimulation surgery also capsulotomy
ablation approach little bit like deep brain stimulation rather
delivering stimulation electrode can actually heat tissue even
destroy say part brain safe destroy kind like
appendix um others say safer modulate seen patients well
ablations know asked earlier find amazing
brain effects can sometimes lack effect
amazing can actually Traverse parts brain without adverse effects
patients function least can test can also destroy small parts
brain talking three four millimeters size little ablations can really
helpful patients no obvious side effects can tell perhaps short
recovery surgery nonetheless despite safe might surgical
procedures still surgical procedures patients hesitant perceived especially
know chance transformative effect quite low can generally
achieve responder rate 50 percent responders still symptomatic
OCD really uh sort inspired really find way deliver therapies
disease specific symptom-specific way years away probably


00:25:40 Brain Areas OCD, Risk, Rewards & Addiction

therapy since part research study moment brain areas


think think OCD years ago remember opening textbook think
undergraduate still work Judith Rappaport National Institutes
mental health late 80s early 90s um done neuroimaging
maybe pet Imaging technique identified portions
basal ganglia sure caudi putanum type structures OCD maybe differences
boys versus girls brain areas sex differences terms OCD
one come clinic know sort work ablations
stimulation uh first start probe brain yeah uh
disorder cortex Sub sub cortex uh cortical control areas areas
involved inhibitory control found not function properly patients
OCD areas like orbital frontal cortex prefrontal cortex image
areas study even rodent model OCD quite honestly models
model aspects OCD OCD human condition can't really model
whole condition mouse wrap perhaps can model compulsive
behavior rat sure pulling hair yeah exactly know not
necessarily obsessive compulsive disorder compulsive behavior perhaps
can ameliorate rat might helpful patient OCD
approach animal modeling OCD thoughtfully uh scientists
think uh study OCD models humans imaging
trying invasively electrodes like epilepsy patients find
areas cortex like prefrontal orbital frontal cortex not functioning
will way non-oc patient often hyper functioning uh
might say Well hyper functioning aren't patients know
functioning better hyper focused yeah hyper focused exactly um no say
not much just dysfunctional need
find way try restore normal function areas not much directional
really um tend oversimplify brain function thinking directionality
much um unfortunately Imaging studies sometimes demonstrate activation
hypoactivation think kinds things can misconstrued
call cortical areas OCD dysregulated need
find way try normalize function uh frontal lobe huge areas
frontal lobe bit basal like ofc orbital frontal cortex
prefrontal cortex definitely consistently seem implicated patients OCD
projections subcortex basal ganglia like saying


caudi putamen dorsal striatum interconnected ventral
striatum area brain uh focus lot energy um
ventralstratum not limited includes nucleus accumbens area
brain know involved gating reward seeking behavior
perturbed seems gait compulsive Behavior meaning rat will pursue reward
despite punishment despite foot shock example can uh similar
OCD patient will um check home safety 3 A.M morning not
sleep night way similar rat seeking food reward uh despite
foot shock um something urge despite risk perhaps
normal judgment take risks function everyday
Society successful take risk take care patients surgery
risk make judgment call not condition just
normal judgment consistently sort puts us risk
something like OCD OCD also know one many conditions suffer
kinds problems tend label tend present
consistent way patients OCD hyper checking Behavior
contamination Behavior feel contaminated wash hands
hours repeatedly drop toothbrush floor will lead compulsive
behavior cleaning toothbrush brushing teeth consistently common
symptoms see signs patients report us observe
know patients eating disorders tend binging disorder
overeat bulimia might Purge despite risk things
um addiction similar tend drug seek addicted um uh
pay off dealer uh order get fix despite risk type urge
despite risk something always really interested
common denominator problems think

00:31:11 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

problems mean common conditions society today
like take quick break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic
greens now called ag-1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers
foundational nutritional needs taking athletic green since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens


reason still take athletic greens usually twice day gets
probiotics need gut health gut important populated gut
microbiota communicate brain immune system basically
biological systems body strongly impact immediate long-term health
probiotics athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health
addition athletic greens contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals
make sure foundational nutritional needs met tastes great

00:32:27 Facial Vocal Ticks, Stimulants, Stress & Superstition

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2 really appreciate
building bridge OCD nucleus accumbens course
associated reward various forms get um share personal
anecdote form question college studying lot relied
caffeine stimulant never really drugs alcohol Lucky
sense don't drink care less alcohol disappeared never really liked recreational
drugs never drawn however college time
little epinephrine pills common lot sports supplements
like pre-workout type things yes not unlike energy drinks now completely
avoid um experience taking one drinking coffee
course gave lift energy similar amphetamine
legal counter time now either banned illegal not
recommend lot energy noticed grunting tick
came back made one mistake still think one mistake
um engage superstitious Behavior knocked wood somehow felt
rewarding like gave totally irrational internally rational sense
security around forget knocking wood found couldn't
break knock wood compulsion felt needed knock wood
started sneaking knock Woods like mid-exam studying pretty soon
knocking wood often developed superstition curious role


superstition compulsion crossover makes sense logically
equally shocked learn stopped taking stimulant quite
happy stop make feel alert couldn't sleep well Etc
Superstition went away well guessing something
reward circuitry called related stimulants not encouraging
anyone take stimulants although healthy use caffeine safe use caffeine might
one universally accepted stimulant um really surprising quickly
came quickly engaged thinking behavior obsessions
compulsions quickly turned off stopped taking Sports
stimulant whatever don't even remember think form
epinephrine ephedrine sure saw epinephrine excuse misspoke ephedrine um
described sound totally outside bounds uh logic imagining
um no happen certain happened yeah no don't think imagining
know grunting mentioned know first didn't
uh comment know sort not put label sounds like tick
know ticks young males extremely common tend go away
linking like since good friend actually famous neuroscientist won't
mention worked hard suppress blinking tits
gets fatigued comes back um high functioning yes personal
life professional life talking starts
kind start wondering like going yeah yeah unfortunate know
people problems especially get severe get Tourette
Syndrome know hard function society friends
Tourette tell just inspired um confident
know people obviously notice problems just live life
successful not typical um friends went
Penn undergrad kinds problems always just happy
inspired typical uh know problems cause
people lose confidence not know uh pursue know
profession may done um things nature think related
fact brains vulnerable get back question
stimulant know think think brain vulnerable know
sort may predisposition um mentioned little
obsessive tick maybe kind know


mild side spectrum OCD um probably well way also also
avoided drugs reason uh life drink little bit wine
um uh think people don't avoid things
see problems relation not just taking stimulant kind
environmental exposure Society causes much stress um
think human conditions human conditions try model
animals animals don't kinds problems know heard
can animal like monkey wild can depression monkey's
version depression don't think really typical human depression know
certainly not prevalent depression human society think know
haven't evolved manage stresses society currently
stimulants probably one know suspect probably little
bit vulnerable um possible stimulant led overdrive prefrontal
orbital frontal cortex even brought little OCD Behavior related super uh
Superstition um no believe entirely also think know
things like OCD kinds psychiatric disorders tend present
college people leave home school
stressed getting exposed things haven't exposed
outside home know brains aren't evolved sophisticated
enough yet help cope kinds stresses manifests
kinds conditions don't want put label conditions
certainly psychiatric disorder also just lots anxiety also
kind problems well um think nucleus accumbens
cortical areas discussing sort send projections
areas probably least one main circuits involved kinds
things relieved no longer present confess oh always feel close long
run helps move know slightly fatigued not overly fatigued slightly
fatigued seems move kind physical compulsion try channel um
never taken medication still still going may call
referral point

00:39:28 Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders & Obesity

sure point uh feeling okay um talk nucleus accumbens


reward circuitry relationship OCD reward addiction uh just give
sense headed realm food related eating
related uh behaviors disorders know important
work nucleus accumbens know one two um one
side brain roles play um healthy brain behavior
pathology yeah nucleus accumbens part brain part reward circuits
Hub reward circuits always fascinated um
scientists around world leading arguably leading scientists
world father addiction Neuroscience call um although tells
nuts Rob malenka studied nucleus accumbens since beginning
career worked Stanford um fabulous scientist Mentor
taught much um taught world much incredible person scientist phys
Physicians yes MD PhD uh brilliant ways um fatherly lot
way terms teaching people science good citizens
well um uh nucleus accumbens area also complicated
lot functions uh interconnects many parts brain um
things nucleus accumbens consistent uh
started getting interested reward surgeon try
improve manage Rewards mean specifically
urge reward normal phenomenon not something trying
stop issue urge reward either puts somebody else
risk probably reward shouldn't suppose say well depends
size reward size risk fits societal
Norms um example obese doctor advising
lose weight try control eating habits uh know perhaps better food
choices important way healthier not pursuing better
food choices urge probably need treat uh drug addict
use heroin opiate considering opiate crisis right now cocaine
untreatable moment uh know cocaine might make feel like
energy day deal work opiate might make
feel better life stressful risk things really high fact
potentially lethal uh urge treatable OCD can't
sleep night nervous didn't lock door
checked 30 times reality people severe OCD um urge


got treat eating disorder eating eating disorders obesity obviously
linked relationship patient food also quite distinct not
everybody obesity eating disorder obviously not everybody
eating disorder obesity particularly interested patients binge eating
disorder well obesity heavily linked not everybody
binging disorder obesity average overweight um
deep brain stimulation trial Penn trying modulate nucleus
accumbens understand better patients failed gastric bypass surgery
aggressive form treatment obesity believe failed
gastric bypass surgery binge eating disorder meaning just can't control
much eat obesity either related even due overeating not
predisposition um body habitus know obesity phenotype something
can see not everybody obese thing important
taught close mentor friend Tom wadden director
Obesity Center Penn center weight eating disorders said
know Casey uh know careful obesity interested addiction
understand interested addictive Tendencies certain patients
obesity uh uh relationship food not everybody obesity
problem fact probably present 20 patients obesity
now taking step back twenty percent patients obesity still massive
problem epidemic proportions perhaps patients either
form binging disorder say degree bingeing disorder uh
least loss control eating common um feature think
eating disorder experts obesity experts neurosurgeons obesity obesity medicine experts
agree common eating disorders obesity also believe
common addicts perhaps patients OCD sort loss control disorder
um actually not disorder known like DSM-5 diagnostic manual
feature say conditions common common denominator
believe can restored least problem can ameliorated improved upon
better understanding tailored treatment nucleus accumbens specifically
learned mice expose mouse now just model expose
mouse high fat food not food normally eat food like 60 fat high
fat like butter um learned expose food like within two
weeks nucleus accumbens not functioning like mouse never exposed


high fat food aspects hyperactive say
aspects hypoactive decreased activity either way not
functioning properly likely function predisposing continued behavior
probably eventually leads things like habit gets developed
whole nother area kinds problems complicated poorly
understood case just focus behavior hand seems
repeated exposure something like high fat food drug abuse type reward
really strong reward way can hijack normal functioning nucleus
accumbens goal invasive trial try restore normal functioning
nucleus accumbens uh mice seems signal predicts
going lose control can use signal deliver sort real-time therapy
form deep brain stimulation just brief amount stimulation actually
blocks behavior interesting time signal actually decreases
frequency suggests level restoring normal function circuit
mouse trying now

00:47:18 Stimulation Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation

human trial fascinating stimulation provided imagine
one stimulate nucleus accumbens see reinforcement whatever
Behavior coincided preceded stimulation stimulation brief delivery
stimulation anywhere 5 10 seconds intended just disrupt
perturbed signaling happening nucleus accumbens disorders like
depression say describe bit state disorder
obviously oversimplified know fluctuations mood
depression well don't let oversimplify much um um now
forgive oversimplification accept depression state disorder
maybe Parkinson's disease state disorder recognizing fluctuate uh
types problems likely not not definitely likely need continuous
therapy form therapy consistent uh perhaps therapy fluctuates
condition nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder OCD
addiction um binging disorder context obesity lot patients
functioning quite normally every single day just intermittently throughout day
brief interruptions normal functions thoughts


food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

brain deliberately course uh seen heard
say amazed effects uh every day yeah privileged able
interact human brain way always goal trying
provide somebody meaningful therapy deliver electrical stimulation
know electrodes might sitting small region
brain regions within millimeters electrodes
stimulated cause temporary brief side effect moment laughter like
said moment panic course can just shut electrode off often
side effects therapeutic actually discovered ways
use deep brain stimulation not just movement disorders like Parkinson's disease
example patients Parkinson's disease psychiatric uh uh
comorbidity like depression obsessive-compulsive disorder lot patients
highly compulsive impulsive sometimes problems actually melt away
trying help Tremor patients also tell us gambling issue
gotten better mood improved well know probably
one reason know can help somebody's Mood making Tremor
go away course see laughter clinic sometimes
stimulating parts brain not just involved
motor circuits also involved call limbic circuit part brain
involved emotion learn modulate areas therapeutically step
step can actually develop therapies indications like depression
say impressive consistent effect patient
Tremor tremming past 20 years can deliver stimulation
electrode clinic immediate relief Tremor
effect inspired neurosurgeon college never really
wanted anything else X accept help develop type therapeutic another
another kind symptom interested obesity related Eating Disorders
compulsive Behavior urge uh something might delicious
dangerous unhealthy drug compulsion like see OCD pests
compulsive disorder uh interestingly like see Tremor melt away deliver
electricity certain part brain can see psychiatric psychiatric
problems not psychiatric disorders say disorders brain can
see symptoms disorders also improve often immediately just like
Tremor see time pick one uh challenge


everyday speed relief described
Tremor really um incredible just thinking drug therapies
side effects still lot mysteries instance ssris even work
work

00:17:20 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Prescriptions & Cognitive Therapies

timing always challenge timing dosage yes absolutely um love learn
OCD several reasons asking first
somewhat obsessive person tend narrowly focused although confess
not step function takes time turn off chatter
thought train mode uh thinking work hard exit
mode like deep Trench adaptive circumstances less adaptive
others know kid uh little bit grunting tick
used intense intense desire clear throat um point
dad said like need stop used squeeze hand every time
used hide back seat car closet provided
much relief eventually passed yes wasn't medicated never anything
every now fatigued working lot notice
starts come back like kind grunting sort like pet
neurological symptom reminds circuits exist us
sometimes go haywire sometimes just subtle um know
excitation something sort third reason get thousands
questions OCD perhaps just tell us OCD sure um
brain areas involved current range treatments
difference someone obsessive somebody true OCD
brief disclosure neurosurgeon take care patients severe obsessive-
compulsive disorder um perspective OCD may little bit different
psychiatrist lives breathes OCD sees patients every single day
OCD probably take care three five patients year deep brain stimulation
obsessive-compulsive disorders don't see patients routinely
laboratory geared researcher focused trying improve outcomes
deep brain stimulation OCD feel expertise perspective
share just brief disclosure feel neurosurgeon obligated


better understand obsessions brain come can
interrupt stop compulsion associated obsession sort
intrinsic feature OCD uh better actually example
offer patient Tremor deep brain stimulation surgery course
risk procedure outcome consistent positive many patients
willing take risk uh obsessive compulsion compulsive disorder
surgery risk however benefit not quite robust lot
patients referring psychiatrists reluctant refer patients us
completely understandable uh leading Endeavor number
collaborators around country try better understand circuits brain uh
study humans invasively non-invasively
electrode-based surgery sort like epilepsy understand seizures
come want understand better obsessions come also
working imaging experts geneticists understand OCD broader level
well uh consider OCD spectrum disorder way uh apologize
might feel using term incorrectly using way
describe patients obsessions even related compulsions might not
meet criteria OCD may something Andrew
neurosurgeon really obsessive safety compulsive surgical
procedures know think aspect OCD often joke
know consider seriously people suffer uh
aspect helps us know famous uh CEOs probably level
OCD uh surgeons scientists alike perhaps can controlled asset
uh goes awry uncontrollable becomes obsessive-compulsive
disorder tend see patients severe failed
medication multiple medications worth trying OCD can
actually helpful neurotransmitter systems tend poke well
ssris sort first line OCD also tricyclics can helpful still
serotonin system know serotonin system interacts know
neurogenergic system dopamine system hard specific one
things think also hard us predict medications
going work kinds patients tricyclics ssris can helpful
definitely first line others exposure response prevention uh
probably effective option kind like cognitive behavioral therapy


different offered psychologists whole field
field say whole clinic institution focused started Edna foa
Penn patients uh offer types cognitive
therapies exposure stressor try get patients habituate whatever
stresses causes uh compulsions help patients live every
day function fabulously helpful therapies variety patients
still 30 patients still suffer OCD severe
OCD sometimes moderate severe patients really
motivated try help um therapies patients right now say
worth pursuing not optimal um one things
balance researcher see patients like want
everything can help think important educate patients risks
benefits deep brain stimulation surgery also capsulotomy
ablation approach little bit like deep brain stimulation rather
delivering stimulation electrode can actually heat tissue even
destroy say part brain safe destroy kind like
appendix um others say safer modulate seen patients well
ablations know asked earlier find amazing
brain effects can sometimes lack effect
amazing can actually Traverse parts brain without adverse effects
patients function least can test can also destroy small parts
brain talking three four millimeters size little ablations can really
helpful patients no obvious side effects can tell perhaps short
recovery surgery nonetheless despite safe might surgical
procedures still surgical procedures patients hesitant perceived especially
know chance transformative effect quite low can generally
achieve responder rate 50 percent responders still symptomatic
OCD really uh sort inspired really find way deliver therapies
disease specific symptom-specific way years away probably


00:25:40 Brain Areas OCD, Risk, Rewards & Addiction

therapy since part research study moment brain areas


think think OCD years ago remember opening textbook think
undergraduate still work Judith Rappaport National Institutes
mental health late 80s early 90s um done neuroimaging
maybe pet Imaging technique identified portions
basal ganglia sure caudi putanum type structures OCD maybe differences
boys versus girls brain areas sex differences terms OCD
one come clinic know sort work ablations
stimulation uh first start probe brain yeah uh
disorder cortex Sub sub cortex uh cortical control areas areas
involved inhibitory control found not function properly patients
OCD areas like orbital frontal cortex prefrontal cortex image
areas study even rodent model OCD quite honestly models
model aspects OCD OCD human condition can't really model
whole condition mouse wrap perhaps can model compulsive
behavior rat sure pulling hair yeah exactly know not
necessarily obsessive compulsive disorder compulsive behavior perhaps
can ameliorate rat might helpful patient OCD
approach animal modeling OCD thoughtfully uh scientists
think uh study OCD models humans imaging
trying invasively electrodes like epilepsy patients find
areas cortex like prefrontal orbital frontal cortex not functioning
will way non-oc patient often hyper functioning uh
might say Well hyper functioning aren't patients know
functioning better hyper focused yeah hyper focused exactly um no say
not much just dysfunctional need
find way try restore normal function areas not much directional
really um tend oversimplify brain function thinking directionality
much um unfortunately Imaging studies sometimes demonstrate activation
hypoactivation think kinds things can misconstrued
call cortical areas OCD dysregulated need
find way try normalize function uh frontal lobe huge areas
frontal lobe bit basal like ofc orbital frontal cortex
prefrontal cortex definitely consistently seem implicated patients OCD
projections subcortex basal ganglia like saying


caudi putamen dorsal striatum interconnected ventral
striatum area brain uh focus lot energy um
ventralstratum not limited includes nucleus accumbens area
brain know involved gating reward seeking behavior
perturbed seems gait compulsive Behavior meaning rat will pursue reward
despite punishment despite foot shock example can uh similar
OCD patient will um check home safety 3 A.M morning not
sleep night way similar rat seeking food reward uh despite
foot shock um something urge despite risk perhaps
normal judgment take risks function everyday
Society successful take risk take care patients surgery
risk make judgment call not condition just
normal judgment consistently sort puts us risk
something like OCD OCD also know one many conditions suffer
kinds problems tend label tend present
consistent way patients OCD hyper checking Behavior
contamination Behavior feel contaminated wash hands
hours repeatedly drop toothbrush floor will lead compulsive
behavior cleaning toothbrush brushing teeth consistently common
symptoms see signs patients report us observe
know patients eating disorders tend binging disorder
overeat bulimia might Purge despite risk things
um addiction similar tend drug seek addicted um uh
pay off dealer uh order get fix despite risk type urge
despite risk something always really interested
common denominator problems think

00:31:11 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

problems mean common conditions society today
like take quick break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic
greens now called ag-1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers
foundational nutritional needs taking athletic green since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens


reason still take athletic greens usually twice day gets
probiotics need gut health gut important populated gut
microbiota communicate brain immune system basically
biological systems body strongly impact immediate long-term health
probiotics athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health
addition athletic greens contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals
make sure foundational nutritional needs met tastes great
like try athletic greens can go athleticgreens.com huberman give
five free travel packs make really easy mix athletic greens
road car plane Etc give year's supply vitamin d3k2
athleticgreens.com huberman

00:32:27 Facial Vocal Ticks, Stimulants, Stress & Superstition

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2 really appreciate
building bridge OCD nucleus accumbens course
associated reward various forms get um share personal
anecdote form question college studying lot relied
caffeine stimulant never really drugs alcohol Lucky
sense don't drink care less alcohol disappeared never really liked recreational
drugs never drawn however college time
little epinephrine pills common lot sports supplements
like pre-workout type things yes not unlike energy drinks now completely
avoid um experience taking one drinking coffee
course gave lift energy similar amphetamine
legal counter time now either banned illegal not
recommend lot energy noticed grunting tick
came back made one mistake still think one mistake
um engage superstitious Behavior knocked wood somehow felt
rewarding like gave totally irrational internally rational sense
security around forget knocking wood found couldn't
break knock wood compulsion felt needed knock wood
started sneaking knock Woods like mid-exam studying pretty soon
knocking wood often developed superstition curious role


superstition compulsion crossover makes sense logically
equally shocked learn stopped taking stimulant quite
happy stop make feel alert couldn't sleep well Etc
Superstition went away well guessing something
reward circuitry called related stimulants not encouraging
anyone take stimulants although healthy use caffeine safe use caffeine might
one universally accepted stimulant um really surprising quickly
came quickly engaged thinking behavior obsessions
compulsions quickly turned off stopped taking Sports
stimulant whatever don't even remember think form
epinephrine ephedrine sure saw epinephrine excuse misspoke ephedrine um
described sound totally outside bounds uh logic imagining
um no happen certain happened yeah no don't think imagining
know grunting mentioned know first didn't
uh comment know sort not put label sounds like tick
know ticks young males extremely common tend go away
linking like since good friend actually famous neuroscientist won't
mention worked hard suppress blinking tits
gets fatigued comes back um high functioning yes personal
life professional life talking starts
kind start wondering like going yeah yeah unfortunate know
people problems especially get severe get Tourette
Syndrome know hard function society friends
Tourette tell just inspired um confident
know people obviously notice problems just live life
successful not typical um friends went
Penn undergrad kinds problems always just happy
inspired typical uh know problems cause
people lose confidence not know uh pursue know
profession may done um things nature think related
fact brains vulnerable get back question
stimulant know think think brain vulnerable know
sort may predisposition um mentioned little
obsessive tick maybe kind know


mild side spectrum OCD um probably well way also also
avoided drugs reason uh life drink little bit wine
um uh think people don't avoid things
see problems relation not just taking stimulant kind
environmental exposure Society causes much stress um
think human conditions human conditions try model
animals animals don't kinds problems know heard
can animal like monkey wild can depression monkey's
version depression don't think really typical human depression know
certainly not prevalent depression human society think know
haven't evolved manage stresses society currently
stimulants probably one know suspect probably little
bit vulnerable um possible stimulant led overdrive prefrontal
orbital frontal cortex even brought little OCD Behavior related super uh
Superstition um no believe entirely also think know
things like OCD kinds psychiatric disorders tend present
college people leave home school
stressed getting exposed things haven't exposed
outside home know brains aren't evolved sophisticated
enough yet help cope kinds stresses manifests
kinds conditions don't want put label conditions
certainly psychiatric disorder also just lots anxiety also
kind problems well um think nucleus accumbens
cortical areas discussing sort send projections
areas probably least one main circuits involved kinds
things relieved no longer present confess oh always feel close long
run helps move know slightly fatigued not overly fatigued slightly
fatigued seems move kind physical compulsion try channel um
never taken medication still still going may call
referral point

00:39:28 Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders & Obesity

sure point uh feeling okay um talk nucleus accumbens


reward circuitry relationship OCD reward addiction uh just give
sense headed realm food related eating
related uh behaviors disorders know important
work nucleus accumbens know one two um one
side brain roles play um healthy brain behavior
pathology yeah nucleus accumbens part brain part reward circuits
Hub reward circuits always fascinated um
scientists around world leading arguably leading scientists
world father addiction Neuroscience call um although tells
nuts Rob malenka studied nucleus accumbens since beginning
career worked Stanford um fabulous scientist Mentor
taught much um taught world much incredible person scientist phys
Physicians yes MD PhD uh brilliant ways um fatherly lot
way terms teaching people science good citizens
well um uh nucleus accumbens area also complicated
lot functions uh interconnects many parts brain um
things nucleus accumbens consistent uh
started getting interested reward surgeon try
improve manage Rewards mean specifically
urge reward normal phenomenon not something trying
stop issue urge reward either puts somebody else
risk probably reward shouldn't suppose say well depends
size reward size risk fits societal
Norms um example obese doctor advising
lose weight try control eating habits uh know perhaps better food
choices important way healthier not pursuing better
food choices urge probably need treat uh drug addict
use heroin opiate considering opiate crisis right now cocaine
untreatable moment uh know cocaine might make feel like
energy day deal work opiate might make
feel better life stressful risk things really high fact
potentially lethal uh urge treatable OCD can't
sleep night nervous didn't lock door
checked 30 times reality people severe OCD um urge


got treat eating disorder eating eating disorders obesity obviously
linked relationship patient food also quite distinct not
everybody obesity eating disorder obviously not everybody
eating disorder obesity particularly interested patients binge eating
disorder well obesity heavily linked not everybody
binging disorder obesity average overweight um
deep brain stimulation trial Penn trying modulate nucleus
accumbens understand better patients failed gastric bypass surgery
aggressive form treatment obesity believe failed
gastric bypass surgery binge eating disorder meaning just can't control
much eat obesity either related even due overeating not
predisposition um body habitus know obesity phenotype something
can see not everybody obese thing important
taught close mentor friend Tom wadden director
Obesity Center Penn center weight eating disorders said
know Casey uh know careful obesity interested addiction
understand interested addictive Tendencies certain patients
obesity uh uh relationship food not everybody obesity
problem fact probably present 20 patients obesity
now taking step back twenty percent patients obesity still massive
problem epidemic proportions perhaps patients either
form binging disorder say degree bingeing disorder uh
least loss control eating common um feature think
eating disorder experts obesity experts neurosurgeons obesity obesity medicine experts
agree common eating disorders obesity also believe
common addicts perhaps patients OCD sort loss control disorder
um actually not disorder known like DSM-5 diagnostic manual
feature say conditions common common denominator
believe can restored least problem can ameliorated improved upon
better understanding tailored treatment nucleus accumbens specifically
learned mice expose mouse now just model expose
mouse high fat food not food normally eat food like 60 fat high
fat like butter um learned expose food like within two
weeks nucleus accumbens not functioning like mouse never exposed


high fat food aspects hyperactive say
aspects hypoactive decreased activity either way not
functioning properly likely function predisposing continued behavior
probably eventually leads things like habit gets developed
whole nother area kinds problems complicated poorly
understood case just focus behavior hand seems
repeated exposure something like high fat food drug abuse type reward
really strong reward way can hijack normal functioning nucleus
accumbens goal invasive trial try restore normal functioning
nucleus accumbens uh mice seems signal predicts
going lose control can use signal deliver sort real-time therapy
form deep brain stimulation just brief amount stimulation actually
blocks behavior interesting time signal actually decreases
frequency suggests level restoring normal function circuit
mouse trying now

00:47:18 Stimulation Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation

human trial fascinating stimulation provided imagine
one stimulate nucleus accumbens see reinforcement whatever
Behavior coincided preceded stimulation stimulation brief delivery
stimulation anywhere 5 10 seconds intended just disrupt
perturbed signaling happening nucleus accumbens disorders like
depression say describe bit state disorder
obviously oversimplified know fluctuations mood
depression well don't let oversimplify much um um now
forgive oversimplification accept depression state disorder
maybe Parkinson's disease state disorder recognizing fluctuate uh
types problems likely not not definitely likely need continuous
therapy form therapy consistent uh perhaps therapy fluctuates
condition nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder OCD
addiction um binging disorder context obesity lot patients
functioning quite normally every single day just intermittently throughout day
brief interruptions normal functions thoughts


food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

Tremor really um incredible just thinking drug therapies
side effects still lot mysteries instance ssris even work
work

00:17:20 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Prescriptions & Cognitive Therapies

timing always challenge timing dosage yes absolutely um love learn
OCD several reasons asking first
somewhat obsessive person tend narrowly focused although confess
not step function takes time turn off chatter
thought train mode uh thinking work hard exit
mode like deep Trench adaptive circumstances less adaptive
others know kid uh little bit grunting tick
used intense intense desire clear throat um point
dad said like need stop used squeeze hand every time
used hide back seat car closet provided
much relief eventually passed yes wasn't medicated never anything
every now fatigued working lot notice
starts come back like kind grunting sort like pet
neurological symptom reminds circuits exist us
sometimes go haywire sometimes just subtle um know
excitation something sort third reason get thousands
questions OCD perhaps just tell us OCD sure um
brain areas involved current range treatments
difference someone obsessive somebody true OCD
brief disclosure neurosurgeon take care patients severe obsessive-
compulsive disorder um perspective OCD may little bit different
psychiatrist lives breathes OCD sees patients every single day
OCD probably take care three five patients year deep brain stimulation
obsessive-compulsive disorders don't see patients routinely
laboratory geared researcher focused trying improve outcomes
deep brain stimulation OCD feel expertise perspective
share just brief disclosure feel neurosurgeon obligated


better understand obsessions brain come can
interrupt stop compulsion associated obsession sort
intrinsic feature OCD uh better actually example
offer patient Tremor deep brain stimulation surgery course
risk procedure outcome consistent positive many patients
willing take risk uh obsessive compulsion compulsive disorder
surgery risk however benefit not quite robust lot
patients referring psychiatrists reluctant refer patients us
completely understandable uh leading Endeavor number
collaborators around country try better understand circuits brain uh
study humans invasively non-invasively
electrode-based surgery sort like epilepsy understand seizures
come want understand better obsessions come also
working imaging experts geneticists understand OCD broader level
well uh consider OCD spectrum disorder way uh apologize
might feel using term incorrectly using way
describe patients obsessions even related compulsions might not
meet criteria OCD may something Andrew
neurosurgeon really obsessive safety compulsive surgical
procedures know think aspect OCD often joke
know consider seriously people suffer uh
aspect helps us know famous uh CEOs probably level
OCD uh surgeons scientists alike perhaps can controlled asset
uh goes awry uncontrollable becomes obsessive-compulsive
disorder tend see patients severe failed
medication multiple medications worth trying OCD can
actually helpful neurotransmitter systems tend poke well
ssris sort first line OCD also tricyclics can helpful still
serotonin system know serotonin system interacts know
neurogenergic system dopamine system hard specific one
things think also hard us predict medications
going work kinds patients tricyclics ssris can helpful
definitely first line others exposure response prevention uh
probably effective option kind like cognitive behavioral therapy


different offered psychologists whole field
field say whole clinic institution focused started Edna foa
Penn patients uh offer types cognitive
therapies exposure stressor try get patients habituate whatever
stresses causes uh compulsions help patients live every
day function fabulously helpful therapies variety patients
still 30 patients still suffer OCD severe
OCD sometimes moderate severe patients really
motivated try help um therapies patients right now say
worth pursuing not optimal um one things
balance researcher see patients like want
everything can help think important educate patients risks
benefits deep brain stimulation surgery also capsulotomy
ablation approach little bit like deep brain stimulation rather
delivering stimulation electrode can actually heat tissue even
destroy say part brain safe destroy kind like
appendix um others say safer modulate seen patients well
ablations know asked earlier find amazing
brain effects can sometimes lack effect
amazing can actually Traverse parts brain without adverse effects
patients function least can test can also destroy small parts
brain talking three four millimeters size little ablations can really
helpful patients no obvious side effects can tell perhaps short
recovery surgery nonetheless despite safe might surgical
procedures still surgical procedures patients hesitant perceived especially
know chance transformative effect quite low can generally
achieve responder rate 50 percent responders still symptomatic
OCD really uh sort inspired really find way deliver therapies
disease specific symptom-specific way years away probably


00:25:40 Brain Areas OCD, Risk, Rewards & Addiction

therapy since part research study moment brain areas


think think OCD years ago remember opening textbook think
undergraduate still work Judith Rappaport National Institutes
mental health late 80s early 90s um done neuroimaging
maybe pet Imaging technique identified portions
basal ganglia sure caudi putanum type structures OCD maybe differences
boys versus girls brain areas sex differences terms OCD
one come clinic know sort work ablations
stimulation uh first start probe brain yeah uh
disorder cortex Sub sub cortex uh cortical control areas areas
involved inhibitory control found not function properly patients
OCD areas like orbital frontal cortex prefrontal cortex image
areas study even rodent model OCD quite honestly models
model aspects OCD OCD human condition can't really model
whole condition mouse wrap perhaps can model compulsive
behavior rat sure pulling hair yeah exactly know not
necessarily obsessive compulsive disorder compulsive behavior perhaps
can ameliorate rat might helpful patient OCD
approach animal modeling OCD thoughtfully uh scientists
think uh study OCD models humans imaging
trying invasively electrodes like epilepsy patients find
areas cortex like prefrontal orbital frontal cortex not functioning
will way non-oc patient often hyper functioning uh
might say Well hyper functioning aren't patients know
functioning better hyper focused yeah hyper focused exactly um no say
not much just dysfunctional need
find way try restore normal function areas not much directional
really um tend oversimplify brain function thinking directionality
much um unfortunately Imaging studies sometimes demonstrate activation
hypoactivation think kinds things can misconstrued
call cortical areas OCD dysregulated need
find way try normalize function uh frontal lobe huge areas
frontal lobe bit basal like ofc orbital frontal cortex
prefrontal cortex definitely consistently seem implicated patients OCD
projections subcortex basal ganglia like saying


caudi putamen dorsal striatum interconnected ventral
striatum area brain uh focus lot energy um
ventralstratum not limited includes nucleus accumbens area
brain know involved gating reward seeking behavior
perturbed seems gait compulsive Behavior meaning rat will pursue reward
despite punishment despite foot shock example can uh similar
OCD patient will um check home safety 3 A.M morning not
sleep night way similar rat seeking food reward uh despite
foot shock um something urge despite risk perhaps
normal judgment take risks function everyday
Society successful take risk take care patients surgery
risk make judgment call not condition just
normal judgment consistently sort puts us risk
something like OCD OCD also know one many conditions suffer
kinds problems tend label tend present
consistent way patients OCD hyper checking Behavior
contamination Behavior feel contaminated wash hands
hours repeatedly drop toothbrush floor will lead compulsive
behavior cleaning toothbrush brushing teeth consistently common
symptoms see signs patients report us observe
know patients eating disorders tend binging disorder
overeat bulimia might Purge despite risk things
um addiction similar tend drug seek addicted um uh
pay off dealer uh order get fix despite risk type urge
despite risk something always really interested
common denominator problems think

00:31:11 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

problems mean common conditions society today
like take quick break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic
greens now called ag-1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers
foundational nutritional needs taking athletic green since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens


reason still take athletic greens usually twice day gets
probiotics need gut health gut important populated gut
microbiota communicate brain immune system basically
biological systems body strongly impact immediate long-term health
probiotics athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health
addition athletic greens contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals
make sure foundational nutritional needs met tastes great
like try athletic greens can go athleticgreens.com huberman give
five free travel packs make really easy mix athletic greens
road car plane Etc give year's supply vitamin d3k2

00:32:27 Facial Vocal Ticks, Stimulants, Stress & Superstition

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2 really appreciate
building bridge OCD nucleus accumbens course
associated reward various forms get um share personal
anecdote form question college studying lot relied
caffeine stimulant never really drugs alcohol Lucky
sense don't drink care less alcohol disappeared never really liked recreational
drugs never drawn however college time
little epinephrine pills common lot sports supplements
like pre-workout type things yes not unlike energy drinks now completely
avoid um experience taking one drinking coffee
course gave lift energy similar amphetamine
legal counter time now either banned illegal not
recommend lot energy noticed grunting tick
came back made one mistake still think one mistake
um engage superstitious Behavior knocked wood somehow felt
rewarding like gave totally irrational internally rational sense
security around forget knocking wood found couldn't
break knock wood compulsion felt needed knock wood
started sneaking knock Woods like mid-exam studying pretty soon
knocking wood often developed superstition curious role


superstition compulsion crossover makes sense logically
equally shocked learn stopped taking stimulant quite
happy stop make feel alert couldn't sleep well Etc
Superstition went away well guessing something
reward circuitry called related stimulants not encouraging
anyone take stimulants although healthy use caffeine safe use caffeine might
one universally accepted stimulant um really surprising quickly
came quickly engaged thinking behavior obsessions
compulsions quickly turned off stopped taking Sports
stimulant whatever don't even remember think form
epinephrine ephedrine sure saw epinephrine excuse misspoke ephedrine um
described sound totally outside bounds uh logic imagining
um no happen certain happened yeah no don't think imagining
know grunting mentioned know first didn't
uh comment know sort not put label sounds like tick
know ticks young males extremely common tend go away
linking like since good friend actually famous neuroscientist won't
mention worked hard suppress blinking tits
gets fatigued comes back um high functioning yes personal
life professional life talking starts
kind start wondering like going yeah yeah unfortunate know
people problems especially get severe get Tourette
Syndrome know hard function society friends
Tourette tell just inspired um confident
know people obviously notice problems just live life
successful not typical um friends went
Penn undergrad kinds problems always just happy
inspired typical uh know problems cause
people lose confidence not know uh pursue know
profession may done um things nature think related
fact brains vulnerable get back question
stimulant know think think brain vulnerable know
sort may predisposition um mentioned little
obsessive tick maybe kind know


mild side spectrum OCD um probably well way also also
avoided drugs reason uh life drink little bit wine
um uh think people don't avoid things
see problems relation not just taking stimulant kind
environmental exposure Society causes much stress um
think human conditions human conditions try model
animals animals don't kinds problems know heard
can animal like monkey wild can depression monkey's
version depression don't think really typical human depression know
certainly not prevalent depression human society think know
haven't evolved manage stresses society currently
stimulants probably one know suspect probably little
bit vulnerable um possible stimulant led overdrive prefrontal
orbital frontal cortex even brought little OCD Behavior related super uh
Superstition um no believe entirely also think know
things like OCD kinds psychiatric disorders tend present
college people leave home school
stressed getting exposed things haven't exposed
outside home know brains aren't evolved sophisticated
enough yet help cope kinds stresses manifests
kinds conditions don't want put label conditions
certainly psychiatric disorder also just lots anxiety also
kind problems well um think nucleus accumbens
cortical areas discussing sort send projections
areas probably least one main circuits involved kinds
things relieved no longer present confess oh always feel close long
run helps move know slightly fatigued not overly fatigued slightly
fatigued seems move kind physical compulsion try channel um
never taken medication still still going may call
referral point

00:39:28 Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders & Obesity

sure point uh feeling okay um talk nucleus accumbens


reward circuitry relationship OCD reward addiction uh just give
sense headed realm food related eating
related uh behaviors disorders know important
work nucleus accumbens know one two um one
side brain roles play um healthy brain behavior
pathology yeah nucleus accumbens part brain part reward circuits
Hub reward circuits always fascinated um
scientists around world leading arguably leading scientists
world father addiction Neuroscience call um although tells
nuts Rob malenka studied nucleus accumbens since beginning
career worked Stanford um fabulous scientist Mentor
taught much um taught world much incredible person scientist phys
Physicians yes MD PhD uh brilliant ways um fatherly lot
way terms teaching people science good citizens
well um uh nucleus accumbens area also complicated
lot functions uh interconnects many parts brain um
things nucleus accumbens consistent uh
started getting interested reward surgeon try
improve manage Rewards mean specifically
urge reward normal phenomenon not something trying
stop issue urge reward either puts somebody else
risk probably reward shouldn't suppose say well depends
size reward size risk fits societal
Norms um example obese doctor advising
lose weight try control eating habits uh know perhaps better food
choices important way healthier not pursuing better
food choices urge probably need treat uh drug addict
use heroin opiate considering opiate crisis right now cocaine
untreatable moment uh know cocaine might make feel like
energy day deal work opiate might make
feel better life stressful risk things really high fact
potentially lethal uh urge treatable OCD can't
sleep night nervous didn't lock door
checked 30 times reality people severe OCD um urge


got treat eating disorder eating eating disorders obesity obviously
linked relationship patient food also quite distinct not
everybody obesity eating disorder obviously not everybody
eating disorder obesity particularly interested patients binge eating
disorder well obesity heavily linked not everybody
binging disorder obesity average overweight um
deep brain stimulation trial Penn trying modulate nucleus
accumbens understand better patients failed gastric bypass surgery
aggressive form treatment obesity believe failed
gastric bypass surgery binge eating disorder meaning just can't control
much eat obesity either related even due overeating not
predisposition um body habitus know obesity phenotype something
can see not everybody obese thing important
taught close mentor friend Tom wadden director
Obesity Center Penn center weight eating disorders said
know Casey uh know careful obesity interested addiction
understand interested addictive Tendencies certain patients
obesity uh uh relationship food not everybody obesity
problem fact probably present 20 patients obesity
now taking step back twenty percent patients obesity still massive
problem epidemic proportions perhaps patients either
form binging disorder say degree bingeing disorder uh
least loss control eating common um feature think
eating disorder experts obesity experts neurosurgeons obesity obesity medicine experts
agree common eating disorders obesity also believe
common addicts perhaps patients OCD sort loss control disorder
um actually not disorder known like DSM-5 diagnostic manual
feature say conditions common common denominator
believe can restored least problem can ameliorated improved upon
better understanding tailored treatment nucleus accumbens specifically
learned mice expose mouse now just model expose
mouse high fat food not food normally eat food like 60 fat high
fat like butter um learned expose food like within two
weeks nucleus accumbens not functioning like mouse never exposed


high fat food aspects hyperactive say
aspects hypoactive decreased activity either way not
functioning properly likely function predisposing continued behavior
probably eventually leads things like habit gets developed
whole nother area kinds problems complicated poorly
understood case just focus behavior hand seems
repeated exposure something like high fat food drug abuse type reward
really strong reward way can hijack normal functioning nucleus
accumbens goal invasive trial try restore normal functioning
nucleus accumbens uh mice seems signal predicts
going lose control can use signal deliver sort real-time therapy
form deep brain stimulation just brief amount stimulation actually
blocks behavior interesting time signal actually decreases
frequency suggests level restoring normal function circuit
mouse trying now

00:47:18 Stimulation Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation

human trial fascinating stimulation provided imagine
one stimulate nucleus accumbens see reinforcement whatever
Behavior coincided preceded stimulation stimulation brief delivery
stimulation anywhere 5 10 seconds intended just disrupt
perturbed signaling happening nucleus accumbens disorders like
depression say describe bit state disorder
obviously oversimplified know fluctuations mood
depression well don't let oversimplify much um um now
forgive oversimplification accept depression state disorder
maybe Parkinson's disease state disorder recognizing fluctuate uh
types problems likely not not definitely likely need continuous
therapy form therapy consistent uh perhaps therapy fluctuates
condition nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder OCD
addiction um binging disorder context obesity lot patients
functioning quite normally every single day just intermittently throughout day
brief interruptions normal functions thoughts


food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

better understand obsessions brain come can
interrupt stop compulsion associated obsession sort
intrinsic feature OCD uh better actually example
offer patient Tremor deep brain stimulation surgery course
risk procedure outcome consistent positive many patients
willing take risk uh obsessive compulsion compulsive disorder
surgery risk however benefit not quite robust lot
patients referring psychiatrists reluctant refer patients us
completely understandable uh leading Endeavor number
collaborators around country try better understand circuits brain uh
study humans invasively non-invasively
electrode-based surgery sort like epilepsy understand seizures
come want understand better obsessions come also
working imaging experts geneticists understand OCD broader level
well uh consider OCD spectrum disorder way uh apologize
might feel using term incorrectly using way
describe patients obsessions even related compulsions might not
meet criteria OCD may something Andrew
neurosurgeon really obsessive safety compulsive surgical
procedures know think aspect OCD often joke
know consider seriously people suffer uh
aspect helps us know famous uh CEOs probably level
OCD uh surgeons scientists alike perhaps can controlled asset
uh goes awry uncontrollable becomes obsessive-compulsive
disorder tend see patients severe failed
medication multiple medications worth trying OCD can
actually helpful neurotransmitter systems tend poke well
ssris sort first line OCD also tricyclics can helpful still
serotonin system know serotonin system interacts know
neurogenergic system dopamine system hard specific one
things think also hard us predict medications
going work kinds patients tricyclics ssris can helpful
definitely first line others exposure response prevention uh
probably effective option kind like cognitive behavioral therapy


different offered psychologists whole field
field say whole clinic institution focused started Edna foa
Penn patients uh offer types cognitive
therapies exposure stressor try get patients habituate whatever
stresses causes uh compulsions help patients live every
day function fabulously helpful therapies variety patients
still 30 patients still suffer OCD severe
OCD sometimes moderate severe patients really
motivated try help um therapies patients right now say
worth pursuing not optimal um one things
balance researcher see patients like want
everything can help think important educate patients risks
benefits deep brain stimulation surgery also capsulotomy
ablation approach little bit like deep brain stimulation rather
delivering stimulation electrode can actually heat tissue even
destroy say part brain safe destroy kind like
appendix um others say safer modulate seen patients well
ablations know asked earlier find amazing
brain effects can sometimes lack effect
amazing can actually Traverse parts brain without adverse effects
patients function least can test can also destroy small parts
brain talking three four millimeters size little ablations can really
helpful patients no obvious side effects can tell perhaps short
recovery surgery nonetheless despite safe might surgical
procedures still surgical procedures patients hesitant perceived especially
know chance transformative effect quite low can generally
achieve responder rate 50 percent responders still symptomatic
OCD really uh sort inspired really find way deliver therapies
disease specific symptom-specific way years away probably


00:25:40 Brain Areas OCD, Risk, Rewards & Addiction

therapy since part research study moment brain areas


think think OCD years ago remember opening textbook think
undergraduate still work Judith Rappaport National Institutes
mental health late 80s early 90s um done neuroimaging
maybe pet Imaging technique identified portions
basal ganglia sure caudi putanum type structures OCD maybe differences
boys versus girls brain areas sex differences terms OCD
one come clinic know sort work ablations
stimulation uh first start probe brain yeah uh
disorder cortex Sub sub cortex uh cortical control areas areas
involved inhibitory control found not function properly patients
OCD areas like orbital frontal cortex prefrontal cortex image
areas study even rodent model OCD quite honestly models
model aspects OCD OCD human condition can't really model
whole condition mouse wrap perhaps can model compulsive
behavior rat sure pulling hair yeah exactly know not
necessarily obsessive compulsive disorder compulsive behavior perhaps
can ameliorate rat might helpful patient OCD
approach animal modeling OCD thoughtfully uh scientists
think uh study OCD models humans imaging
trying invasively electrodes like epilepsy patients find
areas cortex like prefrontal orbital frontal cortex not functioning
will way non-oc patient often hyper functioning uh
might say Well hyper functioning aren't patients know
functioning better hyper focused yeah hyper focused exactly um no say
not much just dysfunctional need
find way try restore normal function areas not much directional
really um tend oversimplify brain function thinking directionality
much um unfortunately Imaging studies sometimes demonstrate activation
hypoactivation think kinds things can misconstrued
call cortical areas OCD dysregulated need
find way try normalize function uh frontal lobe huge areas
frontal lobe bit basal like ofc orbital frontal cortex
prefrontal cortex definitely consistently seem implicated patients OCD
projections subcortex basal ganglia like saying


caudi putamen dorsal striatum interconnected ventral
striatum area brain uh focus lot energy um
ventralstratum not limited includes nucleus accumbens area
brain know involved gating reward seeking behavior
perturbed seems gait compulsive Behavior meaning rat will pursue reward
despite punishment despite foot shock example can uh similar
OCD patient will um check home safety 3 A.M morning not
sleep night way similar rat seeking food reward uh despite
foot shock um something urge despite risk perhaps
normal judgment take risks function everyday
Society successful take risk take care patients surgery
risk make judgment call not condition just
normal judgment consistently sort puts us risk
something like OCD OCD also know one many conditions suffer
kinds problems tend label tend present
consistent way patients OCD hyper checking Behavior
contamination Behavior feel contaminated wash hands
hours repeatedly drop toothbrush floor will lead compulsive
behavior cleaning toothbrush brushing teeth consistently common
symptoms see signs patients report us observe
know patients eating disorders tend binging disorder
overeat bulimia might Purge despite risk things
um addiction similar tend drug seek addicted um uh
pay off dealer uh order get fix despite risk type urge
despite risk something always really interested
common denominator problems think

00:31:11 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

problems mean common conditions society today
like take quick break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic
greens now called ag-1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers
foundational nutritional needs taking athletic green since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens


reason still take athletic greens usually twice day gets
probiotics need gut health gut important populated gut
microbiota communicate brain immune system basically
biological systems body strongly impact immediate long-term health
probiotics athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health
addition athletic greens contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals
make sure foundational nutritional needs met tastes great

00:32:27 Facial Vocal Ticks, Stimulants, Stress & Superstition

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2 really appreciate
building bridge OCD nucleus accumbens course
associated reward various forms get um share personal
anecdote form question college studying lot relied
caffeine stimulant never really drugs alcohol Lucky
sense don't drink care less alcohol disappeared never really liked recreational
drugs never drawn however college time
little epinephrine pills common lot sports supplements
like pre-workout type things yes not unlike energy drinks now completely
avoid um experience taking one drinking coffee
course gave lift energy similar amphetamine
legal counter time now either banned illegal not
recommend lot energy noticed grunting tick
came back made one mistake still think one mistake
um engage superstitious Behavior knocked wood somehow felt
rewarding like gave totally irrational internally rational sense
security around forget knocking wood found couldn't
break knock wood compulsion felt needed knock wood
started sneaking knock Woods like mid-exam studying pretty soon
knocking wood often developed superstition curious role


superstition compulsion crossover makes sense logically
equally shocked learn stopped taking stimulant quite
happy stop make feel alert couldn't sleep well Etc
Superstition went away well guessing something
reward circuitry called related stimulants not encouraging
anyone take stimulants although healthy use caffeine safe use caffeine might
one universally accepted stimulant um really surprising quickly
came quickly engaged thinking behavior obsessions
compulsions quickly turned off stopped taking Sports
stimulant whatever don't even remember think form
epinephrine ephedrine sure saw epinephrine excuse misspoke ephedrine um
described sound totally outside bounds uh logic imagining
um no happen certain happened yeah no don't think imagining
know grunting mentioned know first didn't
uh comment know sort not put label sounds like tick
know ticks young males extremely common tend go away
linking like since good friend actually famous neuroscientist won't
mention worked hard suppress blinking tits
gets fatigued comes back um high functioning yes personal
life professional life talking starts
kind start wondering like going yeah yeah unfortunate know
people problems especially get severe get Tourette
Syndrome know hard function society friends
Tourette tell just inspired um confident
know people obviously notice problems just live life
successful not typical um friends went
Penn undergrad kinds problems always just happy
inspired typical uh know problems cause
people lose confidence not know uh pursue know
profession may done um things nature think related
fact brains vulnerable get back question
stimulant know think think brain vulnerable know
sort may predisposition um mentioned little
obsessive tick maybe kind know


mild side spectrum OCD um probably well way also also
avoided drugs reason uh life drink little bit wine
um uh think people don't avoid things
see problems relation not just taking stimulant kind
environmental exposure Society causes much stress um
think human conditions human conditions try model
animals animals don't kinds problems know heard
can animal like monkey wild can depression monkey's
version depression don't think really typical human depression know
certainly not prevalent depression human society think know
haven't evolved manage stresses society currently
stimulants probably one know suspect probably little
bit vulnerable um possible stimulant led overdrive prefrontal
orbital frontal cortex even brought little OCD Behavior related super uh
Superstition um no believe entirely also think know
things like OCD kinds psychiatric disorders tend present
college people leave home school
stressed getting exposed things haven't exposed
outside home know brains aren't evolved sophisticated
enough yet help cope kinds stresses manifests
kinds conditions don't want put label conditions
certainly psychiatric disorder also just lots anxiety also
kind problems well um think nucleus accumbens
cortical areas discussing sort send projections
areas probably least one main circuits involved kinds
things relieved no longer present confess oh always feel close long
run helps move know slightly fatigued not overly fatigued slightly
fatigued seems move kind physical compulsion try channel um
never taken medication still still going may call
referral point

00:39:28 Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders & Obesity

sure point uh feeling okay um talk nucleus accumbens


reward circuitry relationship OCD reward addiction uh just give
sense headed realm food related eating
related uh behaviors disorders know important
work nucleus accumbens know one two um one
side brain roles play um healthy brain behavior
pathology yeah nucleus accumbens part brain part reward circuits
Hub reward circuits always fascinated um
scientists around world leading arguably leading scientists
world father addiction Neuroscience call um although tells
nuts Rob malenka studied nucleus accumbens since beginning
career worked Stanford um fabulous scientist Mentor
taught much um taught world much incredible person scientist phys
Physicians yes MD PhD uh brilliant ways um fatherly lot
way terms teaching people science good citizens
well um uh nucleus accumbens area also complicated
lot functions uh interconnects many parts brain um
things nucleus accumbens consistent uh
started getting interested reward surgeon try
improve manage Rewards mean specifically
urge reward normal phenomenon not something trying
stop issue urge reward either puts somebody else
risk probably reward shouldn't suppose say well depends
size reward size risk fits societal
Norms um example obese doctor advising
lose weight try control eating habits uh know perhaps better food
choices important way healthier not pursuing better
food choices urge probably need treat uh drug addict
use heroin opiate considering opiate crisis right now cocaine
untreatable moment uh know cocaine might make feel like
energy day deal work opiate might make
feel better life stressful risk things really high fact
potentially lethal uh urge treatable OCD can't
sleep night nervous didn't lock door
checked 30 times reality people severe OCD um urge


got treat eating disorder eating eating disorders obesity obviously
linked relationship patient food also quite distinct not
everybody obesity eating disorder obviously not everybody
eating disorder obesity particularly interested patients binge eating
disorder well obesity heavily linked not everybody
binging disorder obesity average overweight um
deep brain stimulation trial Penn trying modulate nucleus
accumbens understand better patients failed gastric bypass surgery
aggressive form treatment obesity believe failed
gastric bypass surgery binge eating disorder meaning just can't control
much eat obesity either related even due overeating not
predisposition um body habitus know obesity phenotype something
can see not everybody obese thing important
taught close mentor friend Tom wadden director
Obesity Center Penn center weight eating disorders said
know Casey uh know careful obesity interested addiction
understand interested addictive Tendencies certain patients
obesity uh uh relationship food not everybody obesity
problem fact probably present 20 patients obesity
now taking step back twenty percent patients obesity still massive
problem epidemic proportions perhaps patients either
form binging disorder say degree bingeing disorder uh
least loss control eating common um feature think
eating disorder experts obesity experts neurosurgeons obesity obesity medicine experts
agree common eating disorders obesity also believe
common addicts perhaps patients OCD sort loss control disorder
um actually not disorder known like DSM-5 diagnostic manual
feature say conditions common common denominator
believe can restored least problem can ameliorated improved upon
better understanding tailored treatment nucleus accumbens specifically
learned mice expose mouse now just model expose
mouse high fat food not food normally eat food like 60 fat high
fat like butter um learned expose food like within two
weeks nucleus accumbens not functioning like mouse never exposed


high fat food aspects hyperactive say
aspects hypoactive decreased activity either way not
functioning properly likely function predisposing continued behavior
probably eventually leads things like habit gets developed
whole nother area kinds problems complicated poorly
understood case just focus behavior hand seems
repeated exposure something like high fat food drug abuse type reward
really strong reward way can hijack normal functioning nucleus
accumbens goal invasive trial try restore normal functioning
nucleus accumbens uh mice seems signal predicts
going lose control can use signal deliver sort real-time therapy
form deep brain stimulation just brief amount stimulation actually
blocks behavior interesting time signal actually decreases
frequency suggests level restoring normal function circuit
mouse trying now

00:47:18 Stimulation Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation

human trial fascinating stimulation provided imagine
one stimulate nucleus accumbens see reinforcement whatever
Behavior coincided preceded stimulation stimulation brief delivery
stimulation anywhere 5 10 seconds intended just disrupt
perturbed signaling happening nucleus accumbens disorders like
depression say describe bit state disorder
obviously oversimplified know fluctuations mood
depression well don't let oversimplify much um um now
forgive oversimplification accept depression state disorder
maybe Parkinson's disease state disorder recognizing fluctuate uh
types problems likely not not definitely likely need continuous
therapy form therapy consistent uh perhaps therapy fluctuates
condition nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder OCD
addiction um binging disorder context obesity lot patients
functioning quite normally every single day just intermittently throughout day
brief interruptions normal functions thoughts


food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

different offered psychologists whole field
field say whole clinic institution focused started Edna foa
Penn patients uh offer types cognitive
therapies exposure stressor try get patients habituate whatever
stresses causes uh compulsions help patients live every
day function fabulously helpful therapies variety patients
still 30 patients still suffer OCD severe
OCD sometimes moderate severe patients really
motivated try help um therapies patients right now say
worth pursuing not optimal um one things
balance researcher see patients like want
everything can help think important educate patients risks
benefits deep brain stimulation surgery also capsulotomy
ablation approach little bit like deep brain stimulation rather
delivering stimulation electrode can actually heat tissue even
destroy say part brain safe destroy kind like
appendix um others say safer modulate seen patients well
ablations know asked earlier find amazing
brain effects can sometimes lack effect
amazing can actually Traverse parts brain without adverse effects
patients function least can test can also destroy small parts
brain talking three four millimeters size little ablations can really
helpful patients no obvious side effects can tell perhaps short
recovery surgery nonetheless despite safe might surgical
procedures still surgical procedures patients hesitant perceived especially
know chance transformative effect quite low can generally
achieve responder rate 50 percent responders still symptomatic
OCD really uh sort inspired really find way deliver therapies
disease specific symptom-specific way years away probably


00:25:40 Brain Areas OCD, Risk, Rewards & Addiction

therapy since part research study moment brain areas


think think OCD years ago remember opening textbook think
undergraduate still work Judith Rappaport National Institutes
mental health late 80s early 90s um done neuroimaging
maybe pet Imaging technique identified portions
basal ganglia sure caudi putanum type structures OCD maybe differences
boys versus girls brain areas sex differences terms OCD
one come clinic know sort work ablations
stimulation uh first start probe brain yeah uh
disorder cortex Sub sub cortex uh cortical control areas areas
involved inhibitory control found not function properly patients
OCD areas like orbital frontal cortex prefrontal cortex image
areas study even rodent model OCD quite honestly models
model aspects OCD OCD human condition can't really model
whole condition mouse wrap perhaps can model compulsive
behavior rat sure pulling hair yeah exactly know not
necessarily obsessive compulsive disorder compulsive behavior perhaps
can ameliorate rat might helpful patient OCD
approach animal modeling OCD thoughtfully uh scientists
think uh study OCD models humans imaging
trying invasively electrodes like epilepsy patients find
areas cortex like prefrontal orbital frontal cortex not functioning
will way non-oc patient often hyper functioning uh
might say Well hyper functioning aren't patients know
functioning better hyper focused yeah hyper focused exactly um no say
not much just dysfunctional need
find way try restore normal function areas not much directional
really um tend oversimplify brain function thinking directionality
much um unfortunately Imaging studies sometimes demonstrate activation
hypoactivation think kinds things can misconstrued
call cortical areas OCD dysregulated need
find way try normalize function uh frontal lobe huge areas
frontal lobe bit basal like ofc orbital frontal cortex
prefrontal cortex definitely consistently seem implicated patients OCD
projections subcortex basal ganglia like saying


caudi putamen dorsal striatum interconnected ventral
striatum area brain uh focus lot energy um
ventralstratum not limited includes nucleus accumbens area
brain know involved gating reward seeking behavior
perturbed seems gait compulsive Behavior meaning rat will pursue reward
despite punishment despite foot shock example can uh similar
OCD patient will um check home safety 3 A.M morning not
sleep night way similar rat seeking food reward uh despite
foot shock um something urge despite risk perhaps
normal judgment take risks function everyday
Society successful take risk take care patients surgery
risk make judgment call not condition just
normal judgment consistently sort puts us risk
something like OCD OCD also know one many conditions suffer
kinds problems tend label tend present
consistent way patients OCD hyper checking Behavior
contamination Behavior feel contaminated wash hands
hours repeatedly drop toothbrush floor will lead compulsive
behavior cleaning toothbrush brushing teeth consistently common
symptoms see signs patients report us observe
know patients eating disorders tend binging disorder
overeat bulimia might Purge despite risk things
um addiction similar tend drug seek addicted um uh
pay off dealer uh order get fix despite risk type urge
despite risk something always really interested
common denominator problems think

00:31:11 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

00:32:27 Facial Vocal Ticks, Stimulants, Stress & Superstition

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2 really appreciate
building bridge OCD nucleus accumbens course
associated reward various forms get um share personal
anecdote form question college studying lot relied
caffeine stimulant never really drugs alcohol Lucky
sense don't drink care less alcohol disappeared never really liked recreational
drugs never drawn however college time
little epinephrine pills common lot sports supplements
like pre-workout type things yes not unlike energy drinks now completely
avoid um experience taking one drinking coffee
course gave lift energy similar amphetamine
legal counter time now either banned illegal not
recommend lot energy noticed grunting tick
came back made one mistake still think one mistake
um engage superstitious Behavior knocked wood somehow felt
rewarding like gave totally irrational internally rational sense
security around forget knocking wood found couldn't
break knock wood compulsion felt needed knock wood
started sneaking knock Woods like mid-exam studying pretty soon
knocking wood often developed superstition curious role


superstition compulsion crossover makes sense logically
equally shocked learn stopped taking stimulant quite
happy stop make feel alert couldn't sleep well Etc
Superstition went away well guessing something
reward circuitry called related stimulants not encouraging
anyone take stimulants although healthy use caffeine safe use caffeine might
one universally accepted stimulant um really surprising quickly
came quickly engaged thinking behavior obsessions
compulsions quickly turned off stopped taking Sports
stimulant whatever don't even remember think form
epinephrine ephedrine sure saw epinephrine excuse misspoke ephedrine um
described sound totally outside bounds uh logic imagining
um no happen certain happened yeah no don't think imagining
know grunting mentioned know first didn't
uh comment know sort not put label sounds like tick
know ticks young males extremely common tend go away
linking like since good friend actually famous neuroscientist won't
mention worked hard suppress blinking tits
gets fatigued comes back um high functioning yes personal
life professional life talking starts
kind start wondering like going yeah yeah unfortunate know
people problems especially get severe get Tourette
Syndrome know hard function society friends
Tourette tell just inspired um confident
know people obviously notice problems just live life
successful not typical um friends went
Penn undergrad kinds problems always just happy
inspired typical uh know problems cause
people lose confidence not know uh pursue know
profession may done um things nature think related
fact brains vulnerable get back question
stimulant know think think brain vulnerable know
sort may predisposition um mentioned little
obsessive tick maybe kind know


mild side spectrum OCD um probably well way also also
avoided drugs reason uh life drink little bit wine
um uh think people don't avoid things
see problems relation not just taking stimulant kind
environmental exposure Society causes much stress um
think human conditions human conditions try model
animals animals don't kinds problems know heard
can animal like monkey wild can depression monkey's
version depression don't think really typical human depression know
certainly not prevalent depression human society think know
haven't evolved manage stresses society currently
stimulants probably one know suspect probably little
bit vulnerable um possible stimulant led overdrive prefrontal
orbital frontal cortex even brought little OCD Behavior related super uh
Superstition um no believe entirely also think know
things like OCD kinds psychiatric disorders tend present
college people leave home school
stressed getting exposed things haven't exposed
outside home know brains aren't evolved sophisticated
enough yet help cope kinds stresses manifests
kinds conditions don't want put label conditions
certainly psychiatric disorder also just lots anxiety also
kind problems well um think nucleus accumbens
cortical areas discussing sort send projections
areas probably least one main circuits involved kinds
things relieved no longer present confess oh always feel close long
run helps move know slightly fatigued not overly fatigued slightly
fatigued seems move kind physical compulsion try channel um
never taken medication still still going may call
referral point

00:39:28 Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders & Obesity

sure point uh feeling okay um talk nucleus accumbens


reward circuitry relationship OCD reward addiction uh just give
sense headed realm food related eating
related uh behaviors disorders know important
work nucleus accumbens know one two um one
side brain roles play um healthy brain behavior
pathology yeah nucleus accumbens part brain part reward circuits
Hub reward circuits always fascinated um
scientists around world leading arguably leading scientists
world father addiction Neuroscience call um although tells
nuts Rob malenka studied nucleus accumbens since beginning
career worked Stanford um fabulous scientist Mentor
taught much um taught world much incredible person scientist phys
Physicians yes MD PhD uh brilliant ways um fatherly lot
way terms teaching people science good citizens
well um uh nucleus accumbens area also complicated
lot functions uh interconnects many parts brain um
things nucleus accumbens consistent uh
started getting interested reward surgeon try
improve manage Rewards mean specifically
urge reward normal phenomenon not something trying
stop issue urge reward either puts somebody else
risk probably reward shouldn't suppose say well depends
size reward size risk fits societal
Norms um example obese doctor advising
lose weight try control eating habits uh know perhaps better food
choices important way healthier not pursuing better
food choices urge probably need treat uh drug addict
use heroin opiate considering opiate crisis right now cocaine
untreatable moment uh know cocaine might make feel like
energy day deal work opiate might make
feel better life stressful risk things really high fact
potentially lethal uh urge treatable OCD can't
sleep night nervous didn't lock door
checked 30 times reality people severe OCD um urge


got treat eating disorder eating eating disorders obesity obviously
linked relationship patient food also quite distinct not
everybody obesity eating disorder obviously not everybody
eating disorder obesity particularly interested patients binge eating
disorder well obesity heavily linked not everybody
binging disorder obesity average overweight um
deep brain stimulation trial Penn trying modulate nucleus
accumbens understand better patients failed gastric bypass surgery
aggressive form treatment obesity believe failed
gastric bypass surgery binge eating disorder meaning just can't control
much eat obesity either related even due overeating not
predisposition um body habitus know obesity phenotype something
can see not everybody obese thing important
taught close mentor friend Tom wadden director
Obesity Center Penn center weight eating disorders said
know Casey uh know careful obesity interested addiction
understand interested addictive Tendencies certain patients
obesity uh uh relationship food not everybody obesity
problem fact probably present 20 patients obesity
now taking step back twenty percent patients obesity still massive
problem epidemic proportions perhaps patients either
form binging disorder say degree bingeing disorder uh
least loss control eating common um feature think
eating disorder experts obesity experts neurosurgeons obesity obesity medicine experts
agree common eating disorders obesity also believe
common addicts perhaps patients OCD sort loss control disorder
um actually not disorder known like DSM-5 diagnostic manual
feature say conditions common common denominator
believe can restored least problem can ameliorated improved upon
better understanding tailored treatment nucleus accumbens specifically
learned mice expose mouse now just model expose
mouse high fat food not food normally eat food like 60 fat high
fat like butter um learned expose food like within two
weeks nucleus accumbens not functioning like mouse never exposed


high fat food aspects hyperactive say
aspects hypoactive decreased activity either way not
functioning properly likely function predisposing continued behavior
probably eventually leads things like habit gets developed
whole nother area kinds problems complicated poorly
understood case just focus behavior hand seems
repeated exposure something like high fat food drug abuse type reward
really strong reward way can hijack normal functioning nucleus
accumbens goal invasive trial try restore normal functioning
nucleus accumbens uh mice seems signal predicts
going lose control can use signal deliver sort real-time therapy
form deep brain stimulation just brief amount stimulation actually
blocks behavior interesting time signal actually decreases
frequency suggests level restoring normal function circuit
mouse trying now

00:47:18 Stimulation Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation

human trial fascinating stimulation provided imagine
one stimulate nucleus accumbens see reinforcement whatever
Behavior coincided preceded stimulation stimulation brief delivery
stimulation anywhere 5 10 seconds intended just disrupt
perturbed signaling happening nucleus accumbens disorders like
depression say describe bit state disorder
obviously oversimplified know fluctuations mood
depression well don't let oversimplify much um um now
forgive oversimplification accept depression state disorder
maybe Parkinson's disease state disorder recognizing fluctuate uh
types problems likely not not definitely likely need continuous
therapy form therapy consistent uh perhaps therapy fluctuates
condition nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder OCD
addiction um binging disorder context obesity lot patients
functioning quite normally every single day just intermittently throughout day
brief interruptions normal functions thoughts


food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places

think think OCD years ago remember opening textbook think
undergraduate still work Judith Rappaport National Institutes
mental health late 80s early 90s um done neuroimaging
maybe pet Imaging technique identified portions
basal ganglia sure caudi putanum type structures OCD maybe differences
boys versus girls brain areas sex differences terms OCD
one come clinic know sort work ablations
stimulation uh first start probe brain yeah uh
disorder cortex Sub sub cortex uh cortical control areas areas
involved inhibitory control found not function properly patients
OCD areas like orbital frontal cortex prefrontal cortex image
areas study even rodent model OCD quite honestly models
model aspects OCD OCD human condition can't really model
whole condition mouse wrap perhaps can model compulsive
behavior rat sure pulling hair yeah exactly know not
necessarily obsessive compulsive disorder compulsive behavior perhaps
can ameliorate rat might helpful patient OCD
approach animal modeling OCD thoughtfully uh scientists
think uh study OCD models humans imaging
trying invasively electrodes like epilepsy patients find
areas cortex like prefrontal orbital frontal cortex not functioning
will way non-oc patient often hyper functioning uh
might say Well hyper functioning aren't patients know
functioning better hyper focused yeah hyper focused exactly um no say
not much just dysfunctional need
find way try restore normal function areas not much directional
really um tend oversimplify brain function thinking directionality
much um unfortunately Imaging studies sometimes demonstrate activation
hypoactivation think kinds things can misconstrued
call cortical areas OCD dysregulated need
find way try normalize function uh frontal lobe huge areas
frontal lobe bit basal like ofc orbital frontal cortex
prefrontal cortex definitely consistently seem implicated patients OCD
projections subcortex basal ganglia like saying


caudi putamen dorsal striatum interconnected ventral
striatum area brain uh focus lot energy um
ventralstratum not limited includes nucleus accumbens area
brain know involved gating reward seeking behavior
perturbed seems gait compulsive Behavior meaning rat will pursue reward
despite punishment despite foot shock example can uh similar
OCD patient will um check home safety 3 A.M morning not
sleep night way similar rat seeking food reward uh despite
foot shock um something urge despite risk perhaps
normal judgment take risks function everyday
Society successful take risk take care patients surgery
risk make judgment call not condition just
normal judgment consistently sort puts us risk
something like OCD OCD also know one many conditions suffer
kinds problems tend label tend present
consistent way patients OCD hyper checking Behavior
contamination Behavior feel contaminated wash hands
hours repeatedly drop toothbrush floor will lead compulsive
behavior cleaning toothbrush brushing teeth consistently common
symptoms see signs patients report us observe
know patients eating disorders tend binging disorder
overeat bulimia might Purge despite risk things
um addiction similar tend drug seek addicted um uh
pay off dealer uh order get fix despite risk type urge
despite risk something always really interested
common denominator problems think

00:31:11 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

problems mean common conditions society today
like take quick break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic
greens now called ag-1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers
foundational nutritional needs taking athletic green since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens


reason still take athletic greens usually twice day gets
probiotics need gut health gut important populated gut
microbiota communicate brain immune system basically
biological systems body strongly impact immediate long-term health
probiotics athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health
addition athletic greens contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals
make sure foundational nutritional needs met tastes great
like try athletic greens can go athleticgreens.com huberman give
five free travel packs make really easy mix athletic greens
road car plane Etc give year's supply vitamin d3k2
athleticgreens.com huberman

00:32:27 Facial Vocal Ticks, Stimulants, Stress & Superstition

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2 really appreciate
building bridge OCD nucleus accumbens course
associated reward various forms get um share personal
anecdote form question college studying lot relied
caffeine stimulant never really drugs alcohol Lucky
sense don't drink care less alcohol disappeared never really liked recreational
drugs never drawn however college time
little epinephrine pills common lot sports supplements
like pre-workout type things yes not unlike energy drinks now completely
avoid um experience taking one drinking coffee
course gave lift energy similar amphetamine
legal counter time now either banned illegal not
recommend lot energy noticed grunting tick
came back made one mistake still think one mistake
um engage superstitious Behavior knocked wood somehow felt
rewarding like gave totally irrational internally rational sense
security around forget knocking wood found couldn't
break knock wood compulsion felt needed knock wood
started sneaking knock Woods like mid-exam studying pretty soon
knocking wood often developed superstition curious role


superstition compulsion crossover makes sense logically
equally shocked learn stopped taking stimulant quite
happy stop make feel alert couldn't sleep well Etc
Superstition went away well guessing something
reward circuitry called related stimulants not encouraging
anyone take stimulants although healthy use caffeine safe use caffeine might
one universally accepted stimulant um really surprising quickly
came quickly engaged thinking behavior obsessions
compulsions quickly turned off stopped taking Sports
stimulant whatever don't even remember think form
epinephrine ephedrine sure saw epinephrine excuse misspoke ephedrine um
described sound totally outside bounds uh logic imagining
um no happen certain happened yeah no don't think imagining
know grunting mentioned know first didn't
uh comment know sort not put label sounds like tick
know ticks young males extremely common tend go away
linking like since good friend actually famous neuroscientist won't
mention worked hard suppress blinking tits
gets fatigued comes back um high functioning yes personal
life professional life talking starts
kind start wondering like going yeah yeah unfortunate know
people problems especially get severe get Tourette
Syndrome know hard function society friends
Tourette tell just inspired um confident
know people obviously notice problems just live life
successful not typical um friends went
Penn undergrad kinds problems always just happy
inspired typical uh know problems cause
people lose confidence not know uh pursue know
profession may done um things nature think related
fact brains vulnerable get back question
stimulant know think think brain vulnerable know
sort may predisposition um mentioned little
obsessive tick maybe kind know


mild side spectrum OCD um probably well way also also
avoided drugs reason uh life drink little bit wine
um uh think people don't avoid things
see problems relation not just taking stimulant kind
environmental exposure Society causes much stress um
think human conditions human conditions try model
animals animals don't kinds problems know heard
can animal like monkey wild can depression monkey's
version depression don't think really typical human depression know
certainly not prevalent depression human society think know
haven't evolved manage stresses society currently
stimulants probably one know suspect probably little
bit vulnerable um possible stimulant led overdrive prefrontal
orbital frontal cortex even brought little OCD Behavior related super uh
Superstition um no believe entirely also think know
things like OCD kinds psychiatric disorders tend present
college people leave home school
stressed getting exposed things haven't exposed
outside home know brains aren't evolved sophisticated
enough yet help cope kinds stresses manifests
kinds conditions don't want put label conditions
certainly psychiatric disorder also just lots anxiety also
kind problems well um think nucleus accumbens
cortical areas discussing sort send projections
areas probably least one main circuits involved kinds
things relieved no longer present confess oh always feel close long
run helps move know slightly fatigued not overly fatigued slightly
fatigued seems move kind physical compulsion try channel um
never taken medication still still going may call
referral point

00:39:28 Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders & Obesity

sure point uh feeling okay um talk nucleus accumbens


reward circuitry relationship OCD reward addiction uh just give
sense headed realm food related eating
related uh behaviors disorders know important
work nucleus accumbens know one two um one
side brain roles play um healthy brain behavior
pathology yeah nucleus accumbens part brain part reward circuits
Hub reward circuits always fascinated um
scientists around world leading arguably leading scientists
world father addiction Neuroscience call um although tells
nuts Rob malenka studied nucleus accumbens since beginning
career worked Stanford um fabulous scientist Mentor
taught much um taught world much incredible person scientist phys
Physicians yes MD PhD uh brilliant ways um fatherly lot
way terms teaching people science good citizens
well um uh nucleus accumbens area also complicated
lot functions uh interconnects many parts brain um
things nucleus accumbens consistent uh
started getting interested reward surgeon try
improve manage Rewards mean specifically
urge reward normal phenomenon not something trying
stop issue urge reward either puts somebody else
risk probably reward shouldn't suppose say well depends
size reward size risk fits societal
Norms um example obese doctor advising
lose weight try control eating habits uh know perhaps better food
choices important way healthier not pursuing better
food choices urge probably need treat uh drug addict
use heroin opiate considering opiate crisis right now cocaine
untreatable moment uh know cocaine might make feel like
energy day deal work opiate might make
feel better life stressful risk things really high fact
potentially lethal uh urge treatable OCD can't
sleep night nervous didn't lock door
checked 30 times reality people severe OCD um urge


got treat eating disorder eating eating disorders obesity obviously
linked relationship patient food also quite distinct not
everybody obesity eating disorder obviously not everybody
eating disorder obesity particularly interested patients binge eating
disorder well obesity heavily linked not everybody
binging disorder obesity average overweight um
deep brain stimulation trial Penn trying modulate nucleus
accumbens understand better patients failed gastric bypass surgery
aggressive form treatment obesity believe failed
gastric bypass surgery binge eating disorder meaning just can't control
much eat obesity either related even due overeating not
predisposition um body habitus know obesity phenotype something
can see not everybody obese thing important
taught close mentor friend Tom wadden director
Obesity Center Penn center weight eating disorders said
know Casey uh know careful obesity interested addiction
understand interested addictive Tendencies certain patients
obesity uh uh relationship food not everybody obesity
problem fact probably present 20 patients obesity
now taking step back twenty percent patients obesity still massive
problem epidemic proportions perhaps patients either
form binging disorder say degree bingeing disorder uh
least loss control eating common um feature think
eating disorder experts obesity experts neurosurgeons obesity obesity medicine experts
agree common eating disorders obesity also believe
common addicts perhaps patients OCD sort loss control disorder
um actually not disorder known like DSM-5 diagnostic manual
feature say conditions common common denominator
believe can restored least problem can ameliorated improved upon
better understanding tailored treatment nucleus accumbens specifically
learned mice expose mouse now just model expose
mouse high fat food not food normally eat food like 60 fat high
fat like butter um learned expose food like within two
weeks nucleus accumbens not functioning like mouse never exposed


high fat food aspects hyperactive say
aspects hypoactive decreased activity either way not
functioning properly likely function predisposing continued behavior
probably eventually leads things like habit gets developed
whole nother area kinds problems complicated poorly
understood case just focus behavior hand seems
repeated exposure something like high fat food drug abuse type reward
really strong reward way can hijack normal functioning nucleus
accumbens goal invasive trial try restore normal functioning
nucleus accumbens uh mice seems signal predicts
going lose control can use signal deliver sort real-time therapy
form deep brain stimulation just brief amount stimulation actually
blocks behavior interesting time signal actually decreases
frequency suggests level restoring normal function circuit
mouse trying now

00:47:18 Stimulation Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation

human trial fascinating stimulation provided imagine
one stimulate nucleus accumbens see reinforcement whatever
Behavior coincided preceded stimulation stimulation brief delivery
stimulation anywhere 5 10 seconds intended just disrupt
perturbed signaling happening nucleus accumbens disorders like
depression say describe bit state disorder
obviously oversimplified know fluctuations mood
depression well don't let oversimplify much um um now
forgive oversimplification accept depression state disorder
maybe Parkinson's disease state disorder recognizing fluctuate uh
types problems likely not not definitely likely need continuous
therapy form therapy consistent uh perhaps therapy fluctuates
condition nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder OCD
addiction um binging disorder context obesity lot patients
functioning quite normally every single day just intermittently throughout day
brief interruptions normal functions thoughts


food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

caudi putamen dorsal striatum interconnected ventral
striatum area brain uh focus lot energy um
ventralstratum not limited includes nucleus accumbens area
brain know involved gating reward seeking behavior
perturbed seems gait compulsive Behavior meaning rat will pursue reward
despite punishment despite foot shock example can uh similar
OCD patient will um check home safety 3 A.M morning not
sleep night way similar rat seeking food reward uh despite
foot shock um something urge despite risk perhaps
normal judgment take risks function everyday
Society successful take risk take care patients surgery
risk make judgment call not condition just
normal judgment consistently sort puts us risk
something like OCD OCD also know one many conditions suffer
kinds problems tend label tend present
consistent way patients OCD hyper checking Behavior
contamination Behavior feel contaminated wash hands
hours repeatedly drop toothbrush floor will lead compulsive
behavior cleaning toothbrush brushing teeth consistently common
symptoms see signs patients report us observe
know patients eating disorders tend binging disorder
overeat bulimia might Purge despite risk things
um addiction similar tend drug seek addicted um uh
pay off dealer uh order get fix despite risk type urge
despite risk something always really interested
common denominator problems think

00:31:11 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

problems mean common conditions society today
like take quick break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic
greens now called ag-1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers
foundational nutritional needs taking athletic green since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens


reason still take athletic greens usually twice day gets
probiotics need gut health gut important populated gut
microbiota communicate brain immune system basically
biological systems body strongly impact immediate long-term health
probiotics athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health
addition athletic greens contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals
make sure foundational nutritional needs met tastes great
like try athletic greens can go athleticgreens.com huberman give
five free travel packs make really easy mix athletic greens
road car plane Etc give year's supply vitamin d3k2

00:32:27 Facial Vocal Ticks, Stimulants, Stress & Superstition

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2 really appreciate
building bridge OCD nucleus accumbens course
associated reward various forms get um share personal
anecdote form question college studying lot relied
caffeine stimulant never really drugs alcohol Lucky
sense don't drink care less alcohol disappeared never really liked recreational
drugs never drawn however college time
little epinephrine pills common lot sports supplements
like pre-workout type things yes not unlike energy drinks now completely
avoid um experience taking one drinking coffee
course gave lift energy similar amphetamine
legal counter time now either banned illegal not
recommend lot energy noticed grunting tick
came back made one mistake still think one mistake
um engage superstitious Behavior knocked wood somehow felt
rewarding like gave totally irrational internally rational sense
security around forget knocking wood found couldn't
break knock wood compulsion felt needed knock wood
started sneaking knock Woods like mid-exam studying pretty soon
knocking wood often developed superstition curious role


superstition compulsion crossover makes sense logically
equally shocked learn stopped taking stimulant quite
happy stop make feel alert couldn't sleep well Etc
Superstition went away well guessing something
reward circuitry called related stimulants not encouraging
anyone take stimulants although healthy use caffeine safe use caffeine might
one universally accepted stimulant um really surprising quickly
came quickly engaged thinking behavior obsessions
compulsions quickly turned off stopped taking Sports
stimulant whatever don't even remember think form
epinephrine ephedrine sure saw epinephrine excuse misspoke ephedrine um
described sound totally outside bounds uh logic imagining
um no happen certain happened yeah no don't think imagining
know grunting mentioned know first didn't
uh comment know sort not put label sounds like tick
know ticks young males extremely common tend go away
linking like since good friend actually famous neuroscientist won't
mention worked hard suppress blinking tits
gets fatigued comes back um high functioning yes personal
life professional life talking starts
kind start wondering like going yeah yeah unfortunate know
people problems especially get severe get Tourette
Syndrome know hard function society friends
Tourette tell just inspired um confident
know people obviously notice problems just live life
successful not typical um friends went
Penn undergrad kinds problems always just happy
inspired typical uh know problems cause
people lose confidence not know uh pursue know
profession may done um things nature think related
fact brains vulnerable get back question
stimulant know think think brain vulnerable know
sort may predisposition um mentioned little
obsessive tick maybe kind know


mild side spectrum OCD um probably well way also also
avoided drugs reason uh life drink little bit wine
um uh think people don't avoid things
see problems relation not just taking stimulant kind
environmental exposure Society causes much stress um
think human conditions human conditions try model
animals animals don't kinds problems know heard
can animal like monkey wild can depression monkey's
version depression don't think really typical human depression know
certainly not prevalent depression human society think know
haven't evolved manage stresses society currently
stimulants probably one know suspect probably little
bit vulnerable um possible stimulant led overdrive prefrontal
orbital frontal cortex even brought little OCD Behavior related super uh
Superstition um no believe entirely also think know
things like OCD kinds psychiatric disorders tend present
college people leave home school
stressed getting exposed things haven't exposed
outside home know brains aren't evolved sophisticated
enough yet help cope kinds stresses manifests
kinds conditions don't want put label conditions
certainly psychiatric disorder also just lots anxiety also
kind problems well um think nucleus accumbens
cortical areas discussing sort send projections
areas probably least one main circuits involved kinds
things relieved no longer present confess oh always feel close long
run helps move know slightly fatigued not overly fatigued slightly
fatigued seems move kind physical compulsion try channel um
never taken medication still still going may call
referral point

00:39:28 Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders & Obesity

sure point uh feeling okay um talk nucleus accumbens


reward circuitry relationship OCD reward addiction uh just give
sense headed realm food related eating
related uh behaviors disorders know important
work nucleus accumbens know one two um one
side brain roles play um healthy brain behavior
pathology yeah nucleus accumbens part brain part reward circuits
Hub reward circuits always fascinated um
scientists around world leading arguably leading scientists
world father addiction Neuroscience call um although tells
nuts Rob malenka studied nucleus accumbens since beginning
career worked Stanford um fabulous scientist Mentor
taught much um taught world much incredible person scientist phys
Physicians yes MD PhD uh brilliant ways um fatherly lot
way terms teaching people science good citizens
well um uh nucleus accumbens area also complicated
lot functions uh interconnects many parts brain um
things nucleus accumbens consistent uh
started getting interested reward surgeon try
improve manage Rewards mean specifically
urge reward normal phenomenon not something trying
stop issue urge reward either puts somebody else
risk probably reward shouldn't suppose say well depends
size reward size risk fits societal
Norms um example obese doctor advising
lose weight try control eating habits uh know perhaps better food
choices important way healthier not pursuing better
food choices urge probably need treat uh drug addict
use heroin opiate considering opiate crisis right now cocaine
untreatable moment uh know cocaine might make feel like
energy day deal work opiate might make
feel better life stressful risk things really high fact
potentially lethal uh urge treatable OCD can't
sleep night nervous didn't lock door
checked 30 times reality people severe OCD um urge


got treat eating disorder eating eating disorders obesity obviously
linked relationship patient food also quite distinct not
everybody obesity eating disorder obviously not everybody
eating disorder obesity particularly interested patients binge eating
disorder well obesity heavily linked not everybody
binging disorder obesity average overweight um
deep brain stimulation trial Penn trying modulate nucleus
accumbens understand better patients failed gastric bypass surgery
aggressive form treatment obesity believe failed
gastric bypass surgery binge eating disorder meaning just can't control
much eat obesity either related even due overeating not
predisposition um body habitus know obesity phenotype something
can see not everybody obese thing important
taught close mentor friend Tom wadden director
Obesity Center Penn center weight eating disorders said
know Casey uh know careful obesity interested addiction
understand interested addictive Tendencies certain patients
obesity uh uh relationship food not everybody obesity
problem fact probably present 20 patients obesity
now taking step back twenty percent patients obesity still massive
problem epidemic proportions perhaps patients either
form binging disorder say degree bingeing disorder uh
least loss control eating common um feature think
eating disorder experts obesity experts neurosurgeons obesity obesity medicine experts
agree common eating disorders obesity also believe
common addicts perhaps patients OCD sort loss control disorder
um actually not disorder known like DSM-5 diagnostic manual
feature say conditions common common denominator
believe can restored least problem can ameliorated improved upon
better understanding tailored treatment nucleus accumbens specifically
learned mice expose mouse now just model expose
mouse high fat food not food normally eat food like 60 fat high
fat like butter um learned expose food like within two
weeks nucleus accumbens not functioning like mouse never exposed


high fat food aspects hyperactive say
aspects hypoactive decreased activity either way not
functioning properly likely function predisposing continued behavior
probably eventually leads things like habit gets developed
whole nother area kinds problems complicated poorly
understood case just focus behavior hand seems
repeated exposure something like high fat food drug abuse type reward
really strong reward way can hijack normal functioning nucleus
accumbens goal invasive trial try restore normal functioning
nucleus accumbens uh mice seems signal predicts
going lose control can use signal deliver sort real-time therapy
form deep brain stimulation just brief amount stimulation actually
blocks behavior interesting time signal actually decreases
frequency suggests level restoring normal function circuit
mouse trying now

00:47:18 Stimulation Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation

human trial fascinating stimulation provided imagine
one stimulate nucleus accumbens see reinforcement whatever
Behavior coincided preceded stimulation stimulation brief delivery
stimulation anywhere 5 10 seconds intended just disrupt
perturbed signaling happening nucleus accumbens disorders like
depression say describe bit state disorder
obviously oversimplified know fluctuations mood
depression well don't let oversimplify much um um now
forgive oversimplification accept depression state disorder
maybe Parkinson's disease state disorder recognizing fluctuate uh
types problems likely not not definitely likely need continuous
therapy form therapy consistent uh perhaps therapy fluctuates
condition nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder OCD
addiction um binging disorder context obesity lot patients
functioning quite normally every single day just intermittently throughout day
brief interruptions normal functions thoughts


food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

00:32:27 Facial Vocal Ticks, Stimulants, Stress & Superstition

get five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2 really appreciate
building bridge OCD nucleus accumbens course
associated reward various forms get um share personal
anecdote form question college studying lot relied
caffeine stimulant never really drugs alcohol Lucky
sense don't drink care less alcohol disappeared never really liked recreational
drugs never drawn however college time
little epinephrine pills common lot sports supplements
like pre-workout type things yes not unlike energy drinks now completely
avoid um experience taking one drinking coffee
course gave lift energy similar amphetamine
legal counter time now either banned illegal not
recommend lot energy noticed grunting tick
came back made one mistake still think one mistake
um engage superstitious Behavior knocked wood somehow felt
rewarding like gave totally irrational internally rational sense
security around forget knocking wood found couldn't
break knock wood compulsion felt needed knock wood
started sneaking knock Woods like mid-exam studying pretty soon
knocking wood often developed superstition curious role


superstition compulsion crossover makes sense logically
equally shocked learn stopped taking stimulant quite
happy stop make feel alert couldn't sleep well Etc
Superstition went away well guessing something
reward circuitry called related stimulants not encouraging
anyone take stimulants although healthy use caffeine safe use caffeine might
one universally accepted stimulant um really surprising quickly
came quickly engaged thinking behavior obsessions
compulsions quickly turned off stopped taking Sports
stimulant whatever don't even remember think form
epinephrine ephedrine sure saw epinephrine excuse misspoke ephedrine um
described sound totally outside bounds uh logic imagining
um no happen certain happened yeah no don't think imagining
know grunting mentioned know first didn't
uh comment know sort not put label sounds like tick
know ticks young males extremely common tend go away
linking like since good friend actually famous neuroscientist won't
mention worked hard suppress blinking tits
gets fatigued comes back um high functioning yes personal
life professional life talking starts
kind start wondering like going yeah yeah unfortunate know
people problems especially get severe get Tourette
Syndrome know hard function society friends
Tourette tell just inspired um confident
know people obviously notice problems just live life
successful not typical um friends went
Penn undergrad kinds problems always just happy
inspired typical uh know problems cause
people lose confidence not know uh pursue know
profession may done um things nature think related
fact brains vulnerable get back question
stimulant know think think brain vulnerable know
sort may predisposition um mentioned little
obsessive tick maybe kind know


mild side spectrum OCD um probably well way also also
avoided drugs reason uh life drink little bit wine
um uh think people don't avoid things
see problems relation not just taking stimulant kind
environmental exposure Society causes much stress um
think human conditions human conditions try model
animals animals don't kinds problems know heard
can animal like monkey wild can depression monkey's
version depression don't think really typical human depression know
certainly not prevalent depression human society think know
haven't evolved manage stresses society currently
stimulants probably one know suspect probably little
bit vulnerable um possible stimulant led overdrive prefrontal
orbital frontal cortex even brought little OCD Behavior related super uh
Superstition um no believe entirely also think know
things like OCD kinds psychiatric disorders tend present
college people leave home school
stressed getting exposed things haven't exposed
outside home know brains aren't evolved sophisticated
enough yet help cope kinds stresses manifests
kinds conditions don't want put label conditions
certainly psychiatric disorder also just lots anxiety also
kind problems well um think nucleus accumbens
cortical areas discussing sort send projections
areas probably least one main circuits involved kinds
things relieved no longer present confess oh always feel close long
run helps move know slightly fatigued not overly fatigued slightly
fatigued seems move kind physical compulsion try channel um
never taken medication still still going may call
referral point

00:39:28 Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders & Obesity

sure point uh feeling okay um talk nucleus accumbens


reward circuitry relationship OCD reward addiction uh just give
sense headed realm food related eating
related uh behaviors disorders know important
work nucleus accumbens know one two um one
side brain roles play um healthy brain behavior
pathology yeah nucleus accumbens part brain part reward circuits
Hub reward circuits always fascinated um
scientists around world leading arguably leading scientists
world father addiction Neuroscience call um although tells
nuts Rob malenka studied nucleus accumbens since beginning
career worked Stanford um fabulous scientist Mentor
taught much um taught world much incredible person scientist phys
Physicians yes MD PhD uh brilliant ways um fatherly lot
way terms teaching people science good citizens
well um uh nucleus accumbens area also complicated
lot functions uh interconnects many parts brain um
things nucleus accumbens consistent uh
started getting interested reward surgeon try
improve manage Rewards mean specifically
urge reward normal phenomenon not something trying
stop issue urge reward either puts somebody else
risk probably reward shouldn't suppose say well depends
size reward size risk fits societal
Norms um example obese doctor advising
lose weight try control eating habits uh know perhaps better food
choices important way healthier not pursuing better
food choices urge probably need treat uh drug addict
use heroin opiate considering opiate crisis right now cocaine
untreatable moment uh know cocaine might make feel like
energy day deal work opiate might make
feel better life stressful risk things really high fact
potentially lethal uh urge treatable OCD can't
sleep night nervous didn't lock door
checked 30 times reality people severe OCD um urge


got treat eating disorder eating eating disorders obesity obviously
linked relationship patient food also quite distinct not
everybody obesity eating disorder obviously not everybody
eating disorder obesity particularly interested patients binge eating
disorder well obesity heavily linked not everybody
binging disorder obesity average overweight um
deep brain stimulation trial Penn trying modulate nucleus
accumbens understand better patients failed gastric bypass surgery
aggressive form treatment obesity believe failed
gastric bypass surgery binge eating disorder meaning just can't control
much eat obesity either related even due overeating not
predisposition um body habitus know obesity phenotype something
can see not everybody obese thing important
taught close mentor friend Tom wadden director
Obesity Center Penn center weight eating disorders said
know Casey uh know careful obesity interested addiction
understand interested addictive Tendencies certain patients
obesity uh uh relationship food not everybody obesity
problem fact probably present 20 patients obesity
now taking step back twenty percent patients obesity still massive
problem epidemic proportions perhaps patients either
form binging disorder say degree bingeing disorder uh
least loss control eating common um feature think
eating disorder experts obesity experts neurosurgeons obesity obesity medicine experts
agree common eating disorders obesity also believe
common addicts perhaps patients OCD sort loss control disorder
um actually not disorder known like DSM-5 diagnostic manual
feature say conditions common common denominator
believe can restored least problem can ameliorated improved upon
better understanding tailored treatment nucleus accumbens specifically
learned mice expose mouse now just model expose
mouse high fat food not food normally eat food like 60 fat high
fat like butter um learned expose food like within two
weeks nucleus accumbens not functioning like mouse never exposed


high fat food aspects hyperactive say
aspects hypoactive decreased activity either way not
functioning properly likely function predisposing continued behavior
probably eventually leads things like habit gets developed
whole nother area kinds problems complicated poorly
understood case just focus behavior hand seems
repeated exposure something like high fat food drug abuse type reward
really strong reward way can hijack normal functioning nucleus
accumbens goal invasive trial try restore normal functioning
nucleus accumbens uh mice seems signal predicts
going lose control can use signal deliver sort real-time therapy
form deep brain stimulation just brief amount stimulation actually
blocks behavior interesting time signal actually decreases
frequency suggests level restoring normal function circuit
mouse trying now

00:47:18 Stimulation Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation

human trial fascinating stimulation provided imagine
one stimulate nucleus accumbens see reinforcement whatever
Behavior coincided preceded stimulation stimulation brief delivery
stimulation anywhere 5 10 seconds intended just disrupt
perturbed signaling happening nucleus accumbens disorders like
depression say describe bit state disorder
obviously oversimplified know fluctuations mood
depression well don't let oversimplify much um um now
forgive oversimplification accept depression state disorder
maybe Parkinson's disease state disorder recognizing fluctuate uh
types problems likely not not definitely likely need continuous
therapy form therapy consistent uh perhaps therapy fluctuates
condition nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder OCD
addiction um binging disorder context obesity lot patients
functioning quite normally every single day just intermittently throughout day
brief interruptions normal functions thoughts


food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

superstition compulsion crossover makes sense logically
equally shocked learn stopped taking stimulant quite
happy stop make feel alert couldn't sleep well Etc
Superstition went away well guessing something
reward circuitry called related stimulants not encouraging
anyone take stimulants although healthy use caffeine safe use caffeine might
one universally accepted stimulant um really surprising quickly
came quickly engaged thinking behavior obsessions
compulsions quickly turned off stopped taking Sports
stimulant whatever don't even remember think form
epinephrine ephedrine sure saw epinephrine excuse misspoke ephedrine um
described sound totally outside bounds uh logic imagining
um no happen certain happened yeah no don't think imagining
know grunting mentioned know first didn't
uh comment know sort not put label sounds like tick
know ticks young males extremely common tend go away
linking like since good friend actually famous neuroscientist won't
mention worked hard suppress blinking tits
gets fatigued comes back um high functioning yes personal
life professional life talking starts
kind start wondering like going yeah yeah unfortunate know
people problems especially get severe get Tourette
Syndrome know hard function society friends
Tourette tell just inspired um confident
know people obviously notice problems just live life
successful not typical um friends went
Penn undergrad kinds problems always just happy
inspired typical uh know problems cause
people lose confidence not know uh pursue know
profession may done um things nature think related
fact brains vulnerable get back question
stimulant know think think brain vulnerable know
sort may predisposition um mentioned little
obsessive tick maybe kind know


mild side spectrum OCD um probably well way also also
avoided drugs reason uh life drink little bit wine
um uh think people don't avoid things
see problems relation not just taking stimulant kind
environmental exposure Society causes much stress um
think human conditions human conditions try model
animals animals don't kinds problems know heard
can animal like monkey wild can depression monkey's
version depression don't think really typical human depression know
certainly not prevalent depression human society think know
haven't evolved manage stresses society currently
stimulants probably one know suspect probably little
bit vulnerable um possible stimulant led overdrive prefrontal
orbital frontal cortex even brought little OCD Behavior related super uh
Superstition um no believe entirely also think know
things like OCD kinds psychiatric disorders tend present
college people leave home school
stressed getting exposed things haven't exposed
outside home know brains aren't evolved sophisticated
enough yet help cope kinds stresses manifests
kinds conditions don't want put label conditions
certainly psychiatric disorder also just lots anxiety also
kind problems well um think nucleus accumbens
cortical areas discussing sort send projections
areas probably least one main circuits involved kinds
things relieved no longer present confess oh always feel close long
run helps move know slightly fatigued not overly fatigued slightly
fatigued seems move kind physical compulsion try channel um
never taken medication still still going may call
referral point

00:39:28 Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders & Obesity

sure point uh feeling okay um talk nucleus accumbens


reward circuitry relationship OCD reward addiction uh just give
sense headed realm food related eating
related uh behaviors disorders know important
work nucleus accumbens know one two um one
side brain roles play um healthy brain behavior
pathology yeah nucleus accumbens part brain part reward circuits
Hub reward circuits always fascinated um
scientists around world leading arguably leading scientists
world father addiction Neuroscience call um although tells
nuts Rob malenka studied nucleus accumbens since beginning
career worked Stanford um fabulous scientist Mentor
taught much um taught world much incredible person scientist phys
Physicians yes MD PhD uh brilliant ways um fatherly lot
way terms teaching people science good citizens
well um uh nucleus accumbens area also complicated
lot functions uh interconnects many parts brain um
things nucleus accumbens consistent uh
started getting interested reward surgeon try
improve manage Rewards mean specifically
urge reward normal phenomenon not something trying
stop issue urge reward either puts somebody else
risk probably reward shouldn't suppose say well depends
size reward size risk fits societal
Norms um example obese doctor advising
lose weight try control eating habits uh know perhaps better food
choices important way healthier not pursuing better
food choices urge probably need treat uh drug addict
use heroin opiate considering opiate crisis right now cocaine
untreatable moment uh know cocaine might make feel like
energy day deal work opiate might make
feel better life stressful risk things really high fact
potentially lethal uh urge treatable OCD can't
sleep night nervous didn't lock door
checked 30 times reality people severe OCD um urge


got treat eating disorder eating eating disorders obesity obviously
linked relationship patient food also quite distinct not
everybody obesity eating disorder obviously not everybody
eating disorder obesity particularly interested patients binge eating
disorder well obesity heavily linked not everybody
binging disorder obesity average overweight um
deep brain stimulation trial Penn trying modulate nucleus
accumbens understand better patients failed gastric bypass surgery
aggressive form treatment obesity believe failed
gastric bypass surgery binge eating disorder meaning just can't control
much eat obesity either related even due overeating not
predisposition um body habitus know obesity phenotype something
can see not everybody obese thing important
taught close mentor friend Tom wadden director
Obesity Center Penn center weight eating disorders said
know Casey uh know careful obesity interested addiction
understand interested addictive Tendencies certain patients
obesity uh uh relationship food not everybody obesity
problem fact probably present 20 patients obesity
now taking step back twenty percent patients obesity still massive
problem epidemic proportions perhaps patients either
form binging disorder say degree bingeing disorder uh
least loss control eating common um feature think
eating disorder experts obesity experts neurosurgeons obesity obesity medicine experts
agree common eating disorders obesity also believe
common addicts perhaps patients OCD sort loss control disorder
um actually not disorder known like DSM-5 diagnostic manual
feature say conditions common common denominator
believe can restored least problem can ameliorated improved upon
better understanding tailored treatment nucleus accumbens specifically
learned mice expose mouse now just model expose
mouse high fat food not food normally eat food like 60 fat high
fat like butter um learned expose food like within two
weeks nucleus accumbens not functioning like mouse never exposed


high fat food aspects hyperactive say
aspects hypoactive decreased activity either way not
functioning properly likely function predisposing continued behavior
probably eventually leads things like habit gets developed
whole nother area kinds problems complicated poorly
understood case just focus behavior hand seems
repeated exposure something like high fat food drug abuse type reward
really strong reward way can hijack normal functioning nucleus
accumbens goal invasive trial try restore normal functioning
nucleus accumbens uh mice seems signal predicts
going lose control can use signal deliver sort real-time therapy
form deep brain stimulation just brief amount stimulation actually
blocks behavior interesting time signal actually decreases
frequency suggests level restoring normal function circuit
mouse trying now

00:47:18 Stimulation Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation

human trial fascinating stimulation provided imagine
one stimulate nucleus accumbens see reinforcement whatever
Behavior coincided preceded stimulation stimulation brief delivery
stimulation anywhere 5 10 seconds intended just disrupt
perturbed signaling happening nucleus accumbens disorders like
depression say describe bit state disorder
obviously oversimplified know fluctuations mood
depression well don't let oversimplify much um um now
forgive oversimplification accept depression state disorder
maybe Parkinson's disease state disorder recognizing fluctuate uh
types problems likely not not definitely likely need continuous
therapy form therapy consistent uh perhaps therapy fluctuates
condition nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder OCD
addiction um binging disorder context obesity lot patients
functioning quite normally every single day just intermittently throughout day
brief interruptions normal functions thoughts


food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

mild side spectrum OCD um probably well way also also
avoided drugs reason uh life drink little bit wine
um uh think people don't avoid things
see problems relation not just taking stimulant kind
environmental exposure Society causes much stress um
think human conditions human conditions try model
animals animals don't kinds problems know heard
can animal like monkey wild can depression monkey's
version depression don't think really typical human depression know
certainly not prevalent depression human society think know
haven't evolved manage stresses society currently
stimulants probably one know suspect probably little
bit vulnerable um possible stimulant led overdrive prefrontal
orbital frontal cortex even brought little OCD Behavior related super uh
Superstition um no believe entirely also think know
things like OCD kinds psychiatric disorders tend present
college people leave home school
stressed getting exposed things haven't exposed
outside home know brains aren't evolved sophisticated
enough yet help cope kinds stresses manifests
kinds conditions don't want put label conditions
certainly psychiatric disorder also just lots anxiety also
kind problems well um think nucleus accumbens
cortical areas discussing sort send projections
areas probably least one main circuits involved kinds
things relieved no longer present confess oh always feel close long
run helps move know slightly fatigued not overly fatigued slightly
fatigued seems move kind physical compulsion try channel um
never taken medication still still going may call
referral point

00:39:28 Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders & Obesity

sure point uh feeling okay um talk nucleus accumbens


reward circuitry relationship OCD reward addiction uh just give
sense headed realm food related eating
related uh behaviors disorders know important
work nucleus accumbens know one two um one
side brain roles play um healthy brain behavior
pathology yeah nucleus accumbens part brain part reward circuits
Hub reward circuits always fascinated um
scientists around world leading arguably leading scientists
world father addiction Neuroscience call um although tells
nuts Rob malenka studied nucleus accumbens since beginning
career worked Stanford um fabulous scientist Mentor
taught much um taught world much incredible person scientist phys
Physicians yes MD PhD uh brilliant ways um fatherly lot
way terms teaching people science good citizens
well um uh nucleus accumbens area also complicated
lot functions uh interconnects many parts brain um
things nucleus accumbens consistent uh
started getting interested reward surgeon try
improve manage Rewards mean specifically
urge reward normal phenomenon not something trying
stop issue urge reward either puts somebody else
risk probably reward shouldn't suppose say well depends
size reward size risk fits societal
Norms um example obese doctor advising
lose weight try control eating habits uh know perhaps better food
choices important way healthier not pursuing better
food choices urge probably need treat uh drug addict
use heroin opiate considering opiate crisis right now cocaine
untreatable moment uh know cocaine might make feel like
energy day deal work opiate might make
feel better life stressful risk things really high fact
potentially lethal uh urge treatable OCD can't
sleep night nervous didn't lock door
checked 30 times reality people severe OCD um urge


got treat eating disorder eating eating disorders obesity obviously
linked relationship patient food also quite distinct not
everybody obesity eating disorder obviously not everybody
eating disorder obesity particularly interested patients binge eating
disorder well obesity heavily linked not everybody
binging disorder obesity average overweight um
deep brain stimulation trial Penn trying modulate nucleus
accumbens understand better patients failed gastric bypass surgery
aggressive form treatment obesity believe failed
gastric bypass surgery binge eating disorder meaning just can't control
much eat obesity either related even due overeating not
predisposition um body habitus know obesity phenotype something
can see not everybody obese thing important
taught close mentor friend Tom wadden director
Obesity Center Penn center weight eating disorders said
know Casey uh know careful obesity interested addiction
understand interested addictive Tendencies certain patients
obesity uh uh relationship food not everybody obesity
problem fact probably present 20 patients obesity
now taking step back twenty percent patients obesity still massive
problem epidemic proportions perhaps patients either
form binging disorder say degree bingeing disorder uh
least loss control eating common um feature think
eating disorder experts obesity experts neurosurgeons obesity obesity medicine experts
agree common eating disorders obesity also believe
common addicts perhaps patients OCD sort loss control disorder
um actually not disorder known like DSM-5 diagnostic manual
feature say conditions common common denominator
believe can restored least problem can ameliorated improved upon
better understanding tailored treatment nucleus accumbens specifically
learned mice expose mouse now just model expose
mouse high fat food not food normally eat food like 60 fat high
fat like butter um learned expose food like within two
weeks nucleus accumbens not functioning like mouse never exposed


high fat food aspects hyperactive say
aspects hypoactive decreased activity either way not
functioning properly likely function predisposing continued behavior
probably eventually leads things like habit gets developed
whole nother area kinds problems complicated poorly
understood case just focus behavior hand seems
repeated exposure something like high fat food drug abuse type reward
really strong reward way can hijack normal functioning nucleus
accumbens goal invasive trial try restore normal functioning
nucleus accumbens uh mice seems signal predicts
going lose control can use signal deliver sort real-time therapy
form deep brain stimulation just brief amount stimulation actually
blocks behavior interesting time signal actually decreases
frequency suggests level restoring normal function circuit
mouse trying now

00:47:18 Stimulation Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation

human trial fascinating stimulation provided imagine
one stimulate nucleus accumbens see reinforcement whatever
Behavior coincided preceded stimulation stimulation brief delivery
stimulation anywhere 5 10 seconds intended just disrupt
perturbed signaling happening nucleus accumbens disorders like
depression say describe bit state disorder
obviously oversimplified know fluctuations mood
depression well don't let oversimplify much um um now
forgive oversimplification accept depression state disorder
maybe Parkinson's disease state disorder recognizing fluctuate uh
types problems likely not not definitely likely need continuous
therapy form therapy consistent uh perhaps therapy fluctuates
condition nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder OCD
addiction um binging disorder context obesity lot patients
functioning quite normally every single day just intermittently throughout day
brief interruptions normal functions thoughts


food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

reward circuitry relationship OCD reward addiction uh just give
sense headed realm food related eating
related uh behaviors disorders know important
work nucleus accumbens know one two um one
side brain roles play um healthy brain behavior
pathology yeah nucleus accumbens part brain part reward circuits
Hub reward circuits always fascinated um
scientists around world leading arguably leading scientists
world father addiction Neuroscience call um although tells
nuts Rob malenka studied nucleus accumbens since beginning
career worked Stanford um fabulous scientist Mentor
taught much um taught world much incredible person scientist phys
Physicians yes MD PhD uh brilliant ways um fatherly lot
way terms teaching people science good citizens
well um uh nucleus accumbens area also complicated
lot functions uh interconnects many parts brain um
things nucleus accumbens consistent uh
started getting interested reward surgeon try
improve manage Rewards mean specifically
urge reward normal phenomenon not something trying
stop issue urge reward either puts somebody else
risk probably reward shouldn't suppose say well depends
size reward size risk fits societal
Norms um example obese doctor advising
lose weight try control eating habits uh know perhaps better food
choices important way healthier not pursuing better
food choices urge probably need treat uh drug addict
use heroin opiate considering opiate crisis right now cocaine
untreatable moment uh know cocaine might make feel like
energy day deal work opiate might make
feel better life stressful risk things really high fact
potentially lethal uh urge treatable OCD can't
sleep night nervous didn't lock door
checked 30 times reality people severe OCD um urge


got treat eating disorder eating eating disorders obesity obviously
linked relationship patient food also quite distinct not
everybody obesity eating disorder obviously not everybody
eating disorder obesity particularly interested patients binge eating
disorder well obesity heavily linked not everybody
binging disorder obesity average overweight um
deep brain stimulation trial Penn trying modulate nucleus
accumbens understand better patients failed gastric bypass surgery
aggressive form treatment obesity believe failed
gastric bypass surgery binge eating disorder meaning just can't control
much eat obesity either related even due overeating not
predisposition um body habitus know obesity phenotype something
can see not everybody obese thing important
taught close mentor friend Tom wadden director
Obesity Center Penn center weight eating disorders said
know Casey uh know careful obesity interested addiction
understand interested addictive Tendencies certain patients
obesity uh uh relationship food not everybody obesity
problem fact probably present 20 patients obesity
now taking step back twenty percent patients obesity still massive
problem epidemic proportions perhaps patients either
form binging disorder say degree bingeing disorder uh
least loss control eating common um feature think
eating disorder experts obesity experts neurosurgeons obesity obesity medicine experts
agree common eating disorders obesity also believe
common addicts perhaps patients OCD sort loss control disorder
um actually not disorder known like DSM-5 diagnostic manual
feature say conditions common common denominator
believe can restored least problem can ameliorated improved upon
better understanding tailored treatment nucleus accumbens specifically
learned mice expose mouse now just model expose
mouse high fat food not food normally eat food like 60 fat high
fat like butter um learned expose food like within two
weeks nucleus accumbens not functioning like mouse never exposed


high fat food aspects hyperactive say
aspects hypoactive decreased activity either way not
functioning properly likely function predisposing continued behavior
probably eventually leads things like habit gets developed
whole nother area kinds problems complicated poorly
understood case just focus behavior hand seems
repeated exposure something like high fat food drug abuse type reward
really strong reward way can hijack normal functioning nucleus
accumbens goal invasive trial try restore normal functioning
nucleus accumbens uh mice seems signal predicts
going lose control can use signal deliver sort real-time therapy
form deep brain stimulation just brief amount stimulation actually
blocks behavior interesting time signal actually decreases
frequency suggests level restoring normal function circuit
mouse trying now

00:47:18 Stimulation Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation

human trial fascinating stimulation provided imagine
one stimulate nucleus accumbens see reinforcement whatever
Behavior coincided preceded stimulation stimulation brief delivery
stimulation anywhere 5 10 seconds intended just disrupt
perturbed signaling happening nucleus accumbens disorders like
depression say describe bit state disorder
obviously oversimplified know fluctuations mood
depression well don't let oversimplify much um um now
forgive oversimplification accept depression state disorder
maybe Parkinson's disease state disorder recognizing fluctuate uh
types problems likely not not definitely likely need continuous
therapy form therapy consistent uh perhaps therapy fluctuates
condition nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder OCD
addiction um binging disorder context obesity lot patients
functioning quite normally every single day just intermittently throughout day
brief interruptions normal functions thoughts


food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

got treat eating disorder eating eating disorders obesity obviously
linked relationship patient food also quite distinct not
everybody obesity eating disorder obviously not everybody
eating disorder obesity particularly interested patients binge eating
disorder well obesity heavily linked not everybody
binging disorder obesity average overweight um
deep brain stimulation trial Penn trying modulate nucleus
accumbens understand better patients failed gastric bypass surgery
aggressive form treatment obesity believe failed
gastric bypass surgery binge eating disorder meaning just can't control
much eat obesity either related even due overeating not
predisposition um body habitus know obesity phenotype something
can see not everybody obese thing important
taught close mentor friend Tom wadden director
Obesity Center Penn center weight eating disorders said
know Casey uh know careful obesity interested addiction
understand interested addictive Tendencies certain patients
obesity uh uh relationship food not everybody obesity
problem fact probably present 20 patients obesity
now taking step back twenty percent patients obesity still massive
problem epidemic proportions perhaps patients either
form binging disorder say degree bingeing disorder uh
least loss control eating common um feature think
eating disorder experts obesity experts neurosurgeons obesity obesity medicine experts
agree common eating disorders obesity also believe
common addicts perhaps patients OCD sort loss control disorder
um actually not disorder known like DSM-5 diagnostic manual
feature say conditions common common denominator
believe can restored least problem can ameliorated improved upon
better understanding tailored treatment nucleus accumbens specifically
learned mice expose mouse now just model expose
mouse high fat food not food normally eat food like 60 fat high
fat like butter um learned expose food like within two
weeks nucleus accumbens not functioning like mouse never exposed


high fat food aspects hyperactive say
aspects hypoactive decreased activity either way not
functioning properly likely function predisposing continued behavior
probably eventually leads things like habit gets developed
whole nother area kinds problems complicated poorly
understood case just focus behavior hand seems
repeated exposure something like high fat food drug abuse type reward
really strong reward way can hijack normal functioning nucleus
accumbens goal invasive trial try restore normal functioning
nucleus accumbens uh mice seems signal predicts
going lose control can use signal deliver sort real-time therapy
form deep brain stimulation just brief amount stimulation actually
blocks behavior interesting time signal actually decreases
frequency suggests level restoring normal function circuit
mouse trying now

00:47:18 Stimulation Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation

human trial fascinating stimulation provided imagine
one stimulate nucleus accumbens see reinforcement whatever
Behavior coincided preceded stimulation stimulation brief delivery
stimulation anywhere 5 10 seconds intended just disrupt
perturbed signaling happening nucleus accumbens disorders like
depression say describe bit state disorder
obviously oversimplified know fluctuations mood
depression well don't let oversimplify much um um now
forgive oversimplification accept depression state disorder
maybe Parkinson's disease state disorder recognizing fluctuate uh
types problems likely not not definitely likely need continuous
therapy form therapy consistent uh perhaps therapy fluctuates
condition nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder OCD
addiction um binging disorder context obesity lot patients
functioning quite normally every single day just intermittently throughout day
brief interruptions normal functions thoughts


food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

high fat food aspects hyperactive say
aspects hypoactive decreased activity either way not
functioning properly likely function predisposing continued behavior
probably eventually leads things like habit gets developed
whole nother area kinds problems complicated poorly
understood case just focus behavior hand seems
repeated exposure something like high fat food drug abuse type reward
really strong reward way can hijack normal functioning nucleus
accumbens goal invasive trial try restore normal functioning
nucleus accumbens uh mice seems signal predicts
going lose control can use signal deliver sort real-time therapy
form deep brain stimulation just brief amount stimulation actually
blocks behavior interesting time signal actually decreases
frequency suggests level restoring normal function circuit
mouse trying now

00:47:18 Stimulation Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation

human trial fascinating stimulation provided imagine
one stimulate nucleus accumbens see reinforcement whatever
Behavior coincided preceded stimulation stimulation brief delivery
stimulation anywhere 5 10 seconds intended just disrupt
perturbed signaling happening nucleus accumbens disorders like
depression say describe bit state disorder
obviously oversimplified know fluctuations mood
depression well don't let oversimplify much um um now
forgive oversimplification accept depression state disorder
maybe Parkinson's disease state disorder recognizing fluctuate uh
types problems likely not not definitely likely need continuous
therapy form therapy consistent uh perhaps therapy fluctuates
condition nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder OCD
addiction um binging disorder context obesity lot patients
functioning quite normally every single day just intermittently throughout day
brief interruptions normal functions thoughts


food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

food drug abuse really longing want deliver
episodic therapy delivered right time right time try interrupt
circuit aberration problem hand going lead dangerous
behavior kind get patient back track um don't
necessarily think leads reinforcement possible study
rather goal just disrupt perhaps kind Habitual um least
kind recurring problem happening know people bingeing disorder
least severe level tend day don't binge day long
course moment perhaps get home work

00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss Control Eating

stressed might bout binge constitutes binge also want
know binge eating disorder come suddenly meaning entire disorder
one day people wake Suddenly binging disorder know
many buffets entirely serious know kind unlimited food
circuit gets flipped kind starts moving high RPMs speak um
come um mean actually surprised hear day
think just hearing binging disorder assume like OCD probably fluctuates
across day well thought anytime people around food just
simply can't control intake food yes look like terms
onset disorder think underlies day type
phenomena pretty interesting yeah severe binging disorder patients will
binge day couple times day general not
moderate three four times week example reason think
seems surprising think surprising um agree
reason actually just definitions word
neurosurgeon full disclosure mentioned know don't see patients
clinically see research trial purposes try understand literature
around eating disorders obviously collaborate fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh
problems highly Innovative people uh word binge
definition definition word can't necessarily binge day
stomachs not big enough um uh limit much one
can eat meet criteria binge sense loss control


eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

eat enormous amount food brief period time yes generally
doesn't happen day patient severe binge eating
disorder uh however can lose control quite often fact perhaps even every
meal might meet criteria loss control yes may
lost control might not eaten enough constitute Define
binge um no specific number way
really just compared normal meal know perhaps uh 50 daily
calories one brief moment um uh think seems surprising
binders aren't happening often say replace
term binge loss control eating loss control eating Happen dozens
times week um fact know patients studying know
seen patients lose control 20 30 times week probably
term mind saying surprised just one time day
specifically related fact patients eat large amount
food brief period time

00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress

um hard day see um mentioned pre-
existing anxiety might bias somebody binge also fascinated something
observed college girlfriend roommate
aware bulimic binge Purge often uh
ingested alcohol lead binge sure kind opposite
anxiety think alcohol something slightly reduces prefrontal activity
somewhat sedative certainly set higher dosages brings something
said just gonna won't say eloquently seems like
not neither case anxiety leads binging hypo reduced activation
forebrain lower anxiety leads binging dysregulation circuitry
Seesaw go either way can throw things off off balance cases yes
uh uh seems seems pose problem seems like
particularly tricky problem kind explains non-clinical awareness
medication might really hard use way treat able poke
around brain assay real time know feel feel like
binging now feel um binge impulse


patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

patients awake stimulating brain one thing
say stimulate brain area binging goes away partial relief complete relief
know donut um tempting
actually know ablating brain area going lead uh relief
exacerbation no impact disorder yeah uh lot unpack
um try go one step time miss something please remember no
tend ask three-part questions specifically neurosurgeons like
challenge guys astronauts Neuroscience also just
going take moment poke neurosurgery couple close friends
um neurosurgeons consider Casey Randy don't know considers
friend course friend teasing first
incredible hands right not guard hands kind um uh
protection guard tools important tools trade
careful hands not going see heavy deadlifts
not way impacts motor neurons fine control
yes um neurosurgeon heavy deadlifts might want consider getting
different neurosurgery hope didn't put anyone work
thing um tend calm people least exterior
return later okay um throw three four questions
elevated autonomic arousal alertness well decrease autonomic arousal
alertness seem able lead binging question
know whether not stimulate ablate whether not leave
structure alone words one experiments look like
laboratory yeah sort clinic excuse yeah course yeah questions
think time um um want come back deadlifting comment
um regarding referred earlier well don't know
addressed sufficiently either sort like comes first
develop um think first like understand kinds problems sort
construct consider bit two-hit hypothesis um sort
need like concussion literature need second hit can devastating
concussion know want return play symptoms
gone uh cleared physician um uh context Eating Disorders
say binge eating disorder first didn't mention earlier
common eating disorder affects anywhere three five percent


population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme

population wow um probably under-diagnosed obesity way
obesity affects 35 population likely binging disorder affects three
five percent current uh literature uh estimate prevalence
um develop gene disorder related anxiety question um
know think predisposition first hit um actually think
humans predisposition just others um don't think
evolved live society foods readily available enormously
delicious much sugar fat not particular problem
either macronutrients just excess refined uh
think problem um know high fructose corn syrup almost
everything eat bread don't even know bread sometimes just
kind crazy don't don't think evolved live society um
food readily available like um cheap way fact cheaper
foods sort refined palatable argue dangerous eat
think change reward circuits worse um put us risk wanting
um tend get headache eat food like perhaps uh
evolutionary Advantage don't want eat Foods actually
make sick um um lot ways kind wish headache everybody
perhaps wouldn't problems uh least
go away think first issue predisposition uh vulnerability
types foods um undoubtedly certain extent
others first hit predisposition
context sort food focused Society second hit probably
stressful event stressful life um probably recurring stressful event not sure
published never sat like eating disorder expert
question develops not sure actually well well known um
lot ways think answer anybody agree need sort
predisposition exposure environmental exposure genetic
predisposition um also stressor stressor probably one recurring
know obvious society stressors everywhere can
manage often poor know think can relate
something else background think really important mention
patients kinds problems embarrassed society doesn't think
fondly kinds patients know binging disorder patients tend


overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

overweight obviously stigma obese obesity another stigma
opposite way opposite way phenotype standpoint anorexia
mean another stigma know gosh know not make one
sex another girls told pretty thin just
reinforces problem course want complement people make
feel good problem vulnerable society
can lead problems people start thinking oh thin thinner um
think little bit societal understanding brains vulnerable
think will really help changing Society hard society not
know ill meaning uh done accident um society live
can try improve stigma uh kinder people way think lot
problems get better people obese feel embarrassed
obesity doesn't help makes worse give thing might
true anorexics really think important consider things
complicated hard well-controlled study
understand better many variables control
really can't control might able control mouse's home cage
not not society live kind brief uh sort

01:02:07 Electrodes Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying “Craving Cells”

summary answer first question think know second
question sort take well study complicated problem
operating room clinic mentioned operating room
sort first step first want uh just clarify nih-
funded uh trial approved FDA research first human study um
treated two patients four come Penn um study uh
something working towards entire career don't know
nucleus accumbens will identify cells regions seem uh involved
sort reward seeking Behavior call peditive kind like appetite
word repetitive think good word use part nucleus Cummins
repetitive whole thing repetitive probably not huge world huge
neurosurgeon know Target parts brain three four millimeters
size nucleus accumbens almost centimeter size wow didn't realize


large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

large yeah sort like reminds discussions around amygdala everyone
thinks amygdala fear Miguel got lot different sub-regions stimulation
certain areas megdala makes people feel great right another stimulation
errors makes feel terribly afraid exactly shouldn't surprise us
know treat patients Parkinson's disease Tremor know
one part subthalamic nucleus will help Tremor another
part subthalamic nucleus neurologist looking like isn't
working shouldn't surprise us already know know two three
millimeters deviation two three millimeters away want
might not result want probably also true limbic
structures like amygdala nucleus accumbens uh know regarding
nucleus accumbens Traverse nucleus accumbens not order
place electrode want use detect Cravings happening
example try block Cravings leading behavior related
reward seeking overeating case uh decided
operating room actually try leverage tool use time
take care patients Parkinson's Parkinson's lot patients
not Tremor place electrode motor structure try
improve movement disorder often can hear Trevor cells sound
convert electrical signal audible signal can actually hear um
sounds kind like Tremor looks like frequency signal
handshaking exactly patient Parkinson's Trump trembling Yep
awake poking around dedicated careful way course one
poke time one poke time fine wire set wires listening
electrical activity encounter cells sending electrical
activity right similar frequency exactly can stimulate
quiet see Tremor goes away confident
stimulate area case subcollamic nucleus uh will make Tremor
will disrupt Tremor circuit Tremor will dissolve
Parkinson's beautiful inspiring uh us retractable yeah exactly
makes us feel understand brain right least limited way
um analog Tremor terms appetite desire binge craving
craving term know probably terms use way
term chosen use number reasons one


people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

people relate term people binge eating disorder obesity
ask crave answer will often yes um ask lose
control binge might not know mean might not actually feel
control even um uh word craving relatable set
see identify craving cells um patient OCD related fact
target similar part brain tried identify cells related obsessions
believe single case study uh tried optimize
electrode placed proof concept able
elicit sort disease-specific symptom operating room assuming patient
tolerate awake not everybody needs awake procedure
least first human trials um trying trying establish
brain need uh think type approach really critical
know way none published uh think important
people know willing share aspects trying um
uh really first goal trial identify nucleus
accumbens can detect craving cells provoke food craving
operating room first thing ah well um uh
somewhat validated ways example asked patients provide
pictures food rate highly something typically crave
know depending patient might something salty
sweet like donut um oh good love donuts right Donuts great
try Cronut New York City just might try not
eat sort thing reasons just try stop one
one patients given fact uh binges come pretty seldom
day imagine come operating room fasted
semi-fasted faster okay fasted probably probably surgical
reasons wanting kind right
done craniotomy removed patch skull yes lowered wire
nucleus accumbens viewing pictures food crave
thinking olfactory cues smells cronuts yeah love
olfactory haven't implemented great uh thank
give full credit review grant sounds glad
work funded mean make time not joke refer
uh neurosurgeons uh astronauts brain know


extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

extreme edge don't know brain functions far
away different giving mouse access high high fat food not not
disparaging mouse work person says well patient
case might say know hungry donut sounds really good right now
craving like know cross street cross town late meeting eat
three yes maybe even hide somebody cares
doesn't want kind thing hide yes kinds
behaviors projecting fortunate um cravings things life
uh Donuts not among extreme um happening
real time listening cells way listen search
Tremor cells exactly exact tools um recording
small population cells area yeah fact get multi-unit activity
multiple cells uh really try find one single unit listen one neuron yeah
just um much easier understand one neuron versus
trying listen also measure local field potential recordings
analyzed population response thousands cells kind porous
cells exactly um measure offline um device use um sort treat
patients intervene uh studying can't single unit recordings
population responses correlate see
operating room single unit level population response
offline um can explain moment uh yes try identify
craving cells uh feasibility study um can't know
operating searching hours hours hours sort
guidelines set uh developed NIH
FDA make sure feasible safe well um will
spend limited time

01:11:41 Effects Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation

trying identify uh craving cells another uh sort um strategy think
really important um effect stimulation lot patients gets sort
question earlier kind comes first um know lot people
binge lose control food um seek drugs moment
vulnerability preceded call moment sort pre-meal negative


effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

effect basically means right binge feeling feel
stressed anxious compensate momentary symptom binging
losing control food not everybody needs criteria binge try specify
looking loss control eating specifically just Criterion
binge not critical us um um want able trigger
stimulation craving detected device uh trigger
craving believe can sort temporarily Elevate mood ever
briefly five ten seconds stimulation perhaps
elevation mood actually sort disrupt craving binge cycle maybe
habit maybe not crave binge can interrupt
moment feeling good might really good therapy patient fact
deep brain stimulation obsessive-compulsive disorder can fairly reliably
induce positive affect problem not sustained reason likely not
sustained obsessive-compulsive disorder treat condition
continuous stimulation not surprising time effect kind goes away
clinic turn device patients feel great feel
like solved problem call us next day like know
depression came back OCD hasn't gotten better moods back
can can get back yesterday felt great
brain loves homeostatic regulation not like shift patterns regression
norm right um think sort tolerance effect um uh
limiting effect continuous stimulation actually mouse continuous
stimulation um sort blockade binge eating goes away actually mouse
actually demonstrated um published not long ago pnas
deliver stimulation intermittently sort craving signal detected
speak um X effect will robust durable um deliver
continuously actually benefit goes away time always encouraged
colleagues consider episodic stimulation approach rather continuous
deep brain stimulation course episodic conditions
whereas quote unquote State disorders uh oversimplified earlier
might need continuous therapy definitely subject lot research
future um case um goal operating room identify
craving cell um deliver stimulation safely also capture moment elevated mood
able uh OCD patients well also get


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

interest science [Music]


interoperative CAT scan devices now operating room allow us get
Imaging real time fabulous tools didn't 10 years ago can
confirm accuracy um know can see electrode exactly
precisely exactly um know 0.5 millimeters air super precise uh
precise think need um use connectomics tool
brain Imaging called tractography can actually measure circuit connections
indirect assay believe powerful uh assumptions um like
anything science actually map nucleus accumbens
connects prefrontal cortex sort cortical control inhibitory control pathway
pathway intersects nucleus accumbens can Target area
um structurally three goals surgery aim set accomplish
believed achieved two three successful
result

01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments Anorexia

early trial amazing given least non-clination anorexia
mirror image binge eating disorder least learned one
deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um also quite common yes um possible
nucleus accumbens so-called reward circuit also involved anorexia
somehow resistance eating craving fasted state something like
reinforced asked two reasons one
genuinely curious anorexia observed anorexia number people
know striking thing see somebody just resist food despite better
knowledge fact getting quite ill maybe even risk death
reason fact nucleus accumbens site can Harbor cells
promote craving craving fasted States speak think might tell us
something fundamental brain works structures don't control
functions per se structures control dynamics interactions sort like Orchestra
conductor certain number operations perform really main
function coordinate actions lot things not make sure violins
always play certain way alongside oboes can tell not musician
actually appreciation openings yes usually get left
obos yeah usually get ignored partner plays elbows oh yeah yeah


think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

think great analogy way um know make statement little
controversial actually think people understand coming
um across sort sub-specialties medicine uh actually think
especially obesity remember phenotype reflective uh often not
always behavior um consider patients obesity
exhibit sort compulsion towards food overeat despite risk
think kinds patients similar anorexics different um
anorexia obesity phenotypes least specific case obesity
anorexia result compulsion either eat despite risk
types compulsions driven societal pressures brain vulnerabilities
probably similar different just happen manifest differently
manifest differently probably related predisposition perhaps preference
hard know like personal connection Eating Disorders
anorexia included uh yeah think um scary condition often
instills fear psychiatrists think know not not everybody way
mean phenomenal psychiatrists work Stanford
Penn also involved obesity study take care patients mean
heroes lot psychiatrists not domain find
anorexia scared reason said highest mortality psychiatric
conditions includes depression not can patients die suicide
die metabolic complications underweight um uh
scary condition relate trying time bridge obesity
binging disorder atorexia two reasons one think problems
similar different two need um think
well positioned sort tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical
similar approaches um nucleus accumbens studied patients
anorexia China actually postdoc first postdoc honor train uh
Stanford neurosurgeon China came actually
involved trial anorexia benefits um uh studies
Europe um elsewhere examined preliminarily uh effects deep brain
stimulation targeting nucleus accumbens uh anorexia colleagues mine
Canada Andres lozado wonderful neurosurgeon scientist studying
effects going Area 25 directly connected nucleus accumbens
um know monosynaptic connection lot ways know perhaps


delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

delivering stimulation similar delivering stimulation
nucleus accumbens part one critical inhibitory control circuit seen benefits
well um definitely think evidence area need
studying um think episodic approach response stimulation going
sort signal nucleus accumbens seems related
compulsion withhold eating think will trying accomplish uh
study right now just conceived though uh yeah studies move
slowly get grant Grant gets reviewed NIH six
months submit often gets rejected Innovative high
risk edit decrease risk takes obesity took two
years get funded worry time frame lot time
patients anorexia suffer might able help least small sample
patients um nature things go also get
FDA approval kinds things try parallel
enormous undertaking lot ways starting scratch ways
preliminary data go hope year
similar trial anorexia Penn come um not
lab

01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

trying go clear need status non-invasive
brain stimulation ablation blocking activity brain get lot questions
transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah actually done research subject
sure Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put coil head tapping
finger concert uh drum beat sudden uh
stimulation impossible keep time yes drum beat cool cool
pretty wild experience not motor control uh motor control
returned flip switch someone else controlling switch makes
especially Eerie um understanding transcranial magnetic stimulation
used treat depression number brain syndromes non-invasively
no no drilling skull surgeons don't like surgeons love cut drill
purpose um uh understanding spatial Precision isn't
great um ultrasound something hear lot days um


understanding ultrasound can allow researchers clinicians stimulate
specific brain areas perhaps Precision um maybe just give us
coverage used thoughts um uh
forms non-invasive meaning no no flipping open piece skull type brain
stimulation blockade brain activity sure yeah wanted clarify also
surgeries generally don't um way require full craniotomy usually just small
opening size dime bone just just clarify painless
right uh well usually without pain yeah little bit scalp numbing give scalp
block patients getting IV sedations general don't feel anything
tell give local anesthetic usually
asleep part minimally invasive know lot ways no
thing minimally invasive procedure brain know kind
glad hear say oh no know not one neurosurgeons
probably encountered mutual friends uh know
mutual friends favorite people neurosurgery probably
actually think like not neurosurgeons
absolutely right true surgeries really lot ways think
sort ground truth closer ground truth get
um uh know probing purpose actually really like going use
don't mind um just just describing yeah actually
always said said publicly said boss said team um
need embrace non-invasive approaches um little fluffy um
fluffy don't understand work don't necessarily understand
deep brains much works way um don't know exactly
work not precise like work
actually think work doable actually underway um know
Stanford great collaborators think people like Nolan
Williams Connor Liston Cornell others um uh think TMS
transcranial magnetic stimulation FDA approved depression way also
FDA approved OCD nicotine addiction put coil
three less yeah put always scalp uh
frontal lobe different parts frontal lobe demonstrated
little better little bit worse um FDA approved depression
believe uh similar approved uh OCD addiction believe


different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

different Target ask TMS experts can direct
transcranial magnetic stimulation deep cortex try uh
actually studying OCD patients now um part invasive trial uh
trying pull patients TMS trial parallel um
funded foundation OCD research believe can use TMs
define circuit modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily patients
temporary appropriate invasive study something
actively working always believed neurosurgeons need part
discussion non-invasive approaches don't need think
can help make precise probe non-invasively purpose rather
kind don't know non-invasive blast effect kind know just can't
imagine going effective probing purpose can
not invasively well think need better uh way believe
possible think people actively trying um getting deep brain
TMS think will always hard can get indirectly using connectivity
assays targeting superficial structures High connectivity deep structures
example um perhaps one day will TMS Target anorexia obesity
scratching surface invasive approaches problems
even less brain stimulation um much work
eating disorders TMS um sort scarcely studied
little research done space area need
work um obvious reason example patient anorexia just
thinking practically know placing device patient significantly
underweight might not best approach know wound erosion issues like
come developing non-invasive approach think critical problem
target way answer think reliably accept
get Brain brain kinds
conditions just starting get brain know worry
long way away non-invasive approach really works consistently um sorry
interrupt um want make sure touch ultrasound yes um um
historically seemed bit permission people probe around
human brain um sometimes refer podcast papers
done uh allowing patients self-stimulate brain work done
60s now name Escapes Robert um anyway couple papers


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling

mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places

Casey Halpern hope learned much always thank
interest science [Music]


published science allowing patients stimulate couple different brain areas asking
ones preferred always shocked slightly intrigued fact
brain area three patients don't think
syndromes think volunteered experiments don't think
anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah think uh not now things
changed um fortunately um three seem like midline
thalamic structure listening just area kind dead center
brain um less evoked sense kind frustration anger
surprised thought oh Robert Heath experiments rather
patients preferring stimulate areas evoke laughter Joy feeling
drunkenness Delight also explains lot observe social media sort
um kind people repeatedly engaging battles um kind trivial seems like
frustration anger might reward circuitry anyway don't want go
far rabbit hole um deep one deep one kind gets
nature yeah know humans find interesting rewarding
know ability inability probe around brain safe way without need
somebody sick think enormously powerful least
mind charge not um offer opportunity really come
understanding human brain works without issues
translate Mouse studies huge value animal studies
agree um many things want know human brain involve
asking person hey feel set neurons stimulated
don't feel uh mouse can ask ask not going tell
us something tell us not going tell us English um
overcome challenge

01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s

first ultrasound prefer ultrasound ultrasound going really
useful towards solving clinical issues basic issues yeah think um
start ultrasound come back um ultrasound right now
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound um uh
FDA approved method deliver ablation brain non-invasively
researchers included trying use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized

going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type

interest science [Music]


resonance guided Focus ultrasound MRI guided Focus ultrasound use
modulatory way not just ablation drive neuronal activity inhibit perhaps
still learning um trials trying understand
can use ultrasound open blood-brain barrier can deliver medication
specific area uh perhaps brain tumor something like um
exciting field um FDA approved Tremor right now actually
routinely um patients Tremor Parkinson's central Tremor um
love uh often just kind miracle no incision don't
place electrode brain achieve similar result early pathology
Parkinson's can someone think approaching instance somebody
parent sibling developing resting Tremor yeah obviously
talk neurologist neurosurgeon non-invasive approach
incredible opposed just take taking drugs increase
dopamine levels yeah um depending reason Tremor dictate
kind medication use Parkinson's not might
central Trevor way essential tremors 10 times common Parkinson's really
essential tremor common neurologic condition patients age 70.
often aren't aware people essential Trevor feel forgotten
disease no Michael J fox central Tremor sent letter sorry
essential tremor essential um actually sent letter Bill Clinton observed
uh Tremor think actually disclosed hoped
become champion patients central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor
well also public not able get eager become
champion condition like Michael J fox patients need champion
like um unfortunately bit forgotten disease nevertheless
FDA approval focus ultrasound Tremor um another's trying get attention
sure uh fabulously effective patients treats patients one side
usually dominant hand worst hand um really speaks fact
wow can deliver non-invasively ablation brain hypothesized zone
think related problem hand least Tremor works really well
effective psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um
perhaps uh actually ideal problem don't know
ablation um trial like OCD deliver
ablation area brain delivering ablations years


patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um
right historically without much regulation probed brain um
problem can't learn lot experiments now uh well way least
don't know exactly electrodes didn't MRI scanning high
quality cat scanning know electrodes certainty
know two three millimeters matters also didn't tools place
electrodes precise way back unfortunately can't learn lot
experiments right now sort redesigning way now
um patients epilepsy benefit time revolution
America Europe America stereo
encephalography basically like EEG patients epilepsy
invasive electrodes Place tiny little wires less millimeter diameter
throughout brain parts brain believe involved seizures
admit patients hospital figure seizures
starting propagating um know stimulate electrodes
see symptom important try identify region
thought either remove surgically ablate laser put stimulator
perhaps commonplace now epilepsy um works extremely well
safe course still brain procedure uh complication rate
surprisingly low quite honestly amount electors place um
extremely well tolerated patients leave hospital don't even feel
like surgery uh actually lot interest using procedure
study mental health disorders trying patients obsessive
compulsive disorder awaiting FDA decision uh actually credit uh


colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places

patients OCD helps bit called capsulotomy um really
outcome probably going nice method non-
invasive need find new Target conditions
common denominator urge despite risk sort compulsion um yeah
perhaps Target don't know um argue need
modulatory experiments either device uh invasive recordings uh
better understand

01:36:40 Future Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression

problems coming Define ultrasound treatment um

something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try

colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized

going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say

colleagues Baylor UCSF studying uh already fabulous
colleagues UCSF studied depression using type approach mutual
friend uh know Eddie Chang wonderful friend colleague
somebody emulated many years well uh Psychiatry team
UCSF worked together sort bringing together epilepsy technique
Psychiatry expertise study better Target electrodes depression
tell consistent Target perhaps becomes ultrasound
Target um right now approach bit reversible can always
shut electrode off even remove electrode perhaps not optimal
location treat depression uh actually large volume cases perhaps
pool data develop new ultrasound Target depression think
fabulous probably long-term goal um not speak
something sure radar Baylor trying
thing depression approaches little bit different similar tool try
understand uh depression know working types uh
colleagues friends try bring OCD well
know makes sense try addiction obesity anorexia might
ask well aren't obesity right now uh study
reason um developed target obesity uh binge eating disorder uh
developed mice believe um relevant human State
can model problem mouse bit better can model depression OCD
feel like can rely pre-clinical studies whereas perhaps
don't want say complicated human mental health conditions
hard model mouse really study human can
perhaps start epileptic patient patient electrodes try provoke
depressed state study epileptics like Dr Chang done comorbid
depression example can really validate approach well end
getting human brain need disease specifically will
eventually lead non invasive approach either lesion modulatory approach
modulatory like TMS lesion approach ultrasound couldn't
agree meanwhile many many millions people suffering
depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's essential tremor Etc well first
say based everything told thus far amazing
pharmacologic treatments work systemic impacting


serotonin serotonergic neurons dopaminergic neurons not
targeting specific batch cells

01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation

makes perfect sense side effects exist earlier said something
really grabbed attention want come back people can
made feel make feel just little bit better little less anxious just prior
craving episode binge episode maybe even people can become better
detecting internal States kind veering toward binge
veering toward using drug maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking based
said earlier kind um pre-behavioral States kind drift
steering um sound like powerful levels awareness least now
specific sites brain can Target non-invasive methods
deployed millions millions people seems like awareness seems like
maybe among best tools people develop yes 100 agree
know person OCD uh suffers anorexia binge eating
disorder clinicians know just want highlight said
mean not not clinician always say don't prescribe anything
profess things um uh awareness one's thinking seems immensely powerful
context yeah um clinical probe use
say patient lie experience happens mind
stimulate basically whole thing whole surgery whole
procedure go badly wrong patient course honest
incentivized honest ah
know gone day without binge know smell donut
thought donut starting particular Allure awareness seems like
incredibly powerful thing build cultivate yes always thought
improve awareness can improve outcomes think probably true
many patients problem think comes fact
patients resistant treatment patients see surgeon
example patients tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly
tried medications tried Behavioral Management aware problem
shown us can tell us craving despite


craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused

uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big
picture don't get sort uh flustered uh tend tend really
good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like
days tend bit gentler unless great writing days can long know
um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies
probably drawn come neurosurgery want
rotated neurosurgery might spend month know pretending
neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo
college fit college actually new tuxedo admittedly
size tuxedo college think um always related
problems patients certain extent know
vulnerable working hardest least

02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation

amount sleep related yes exercise always
tool um recently exercise know strength training think
important compared cardio um don't enough either um definitely
helps meditation helps bit every night go
sleep um know use app probably not best way meditation
keeps regularly best way Andrew couldn't agree
know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't
tool probably needed now helpful really
appreciate sharing tools number people uh guessing might
want become neurosurgeons really believe hearing today's conversation
will spark interest medicine neurosurgery um well certainly need
physician can become neurosurgeon end neurosurgery
cases beautiful predict will happen will happen
excuse consequence um shared today really appreciate
mentioning um emphasis appreciation quality time uh much see
quality time know listeners will well really want thank
taking time not just immensely busy important schedule
work really cutting don't want say
bleeding edge context not going sound right extreme
Cutting Edge understand human brain works can
repaired um marvelous work will Point people various places
can find online need help clinic clinic

craving despite involved invasive brain surgical trial highly know
first human novel study think will positive effect still
experimental uh still can't stop sort made aware
possibly use grammar correctly think um aware
possibly still lose control studied lab will
bring patients laboratory implanted device try provoke
electrographic electrical signal can detected actual device will
stimulate home actually initiate stimulation want
us see can device detect craving cell signal going different
saw operating room single cell devices
electrodes millimeter diameter instead like tenth millimeter
use operating room um hearing detecting
say thousands cells responses actually way provoke binges
called mood provocation well well well validated little bit like
provoking seizures epilepsy monitoring unit sort uh psychiatric
monitoring unit food monitoring unit uh actually psychiatrist
eating disorder Specialists come induce mood related patient's sort
self-described binge episode psychiatrist comes provokes yes feeling
can evoke negative behavior exactly right can video
synchronize video brain signal recordings um patients wear eye
tracker can see eating times looking
specifically allows us best temporal resolution possible
understand happening right bite even video surveillance
one day one-way mirror laboratory setting patients well
aware studied going binge still believe
just can't control aware probably
severe think can improve awareness not just
societal awareness talking earlier patient awareness around
problem think powerful way help many patients
sort role cognitive behavioral therapy um problem cognitive
behavioral therapy say limitation actually don't problem
think wonderful treatment um stop many patients go back
old behaviors don't say old habits might habit old behaviors
um problem not necessarily lasting absence continued


cognitive behavioral therapy people can benefit long term can't uh
think less severe patients improving awareness key really
refractory patients kind like disease despite awareness
can't control trying

01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions

restore improved ability control behavior think role
machines artificial intelligence uh couple Laboratories
University Washington using particular signature patterns within voice try
help suicidal people suicidally depressed know headed
towards episode even can consciously know gets right
issues Free Will whether not machines can smarter
know one argue search algorithms Google search
engines actually aware preferences um basically
devices listening people talk day also paying attention
patterns breathing well people slept Etc integrating huge number cues
signaling somebody know yellow light like know headed
depressive episode person might say feel fine feel pretty good kind
Baseline state say ah preceding last
episode took deep dark trench took months get um
wonder whether not devices help sorts things
talking today yeah think um always said get Brain
get get brain understand signals look
like know non-invasive signals think possible
scientifically sophisticated enough use machine learning um sort kind
botan technique anticipate somebody going highly impulsive know
suicide dangerous impulse something immensely focus
lab impulsivity talked mostly compulsion compulsion know
going reward urge despite risk um impulsivity similar different
kind going something um little bit model impulsivity
mouse know related know going food reward without sort
paired tone mouse supposed wait mouse doesn't want wait
anymore just go food um Mouse yeah oh


relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten

neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big

good figuring quality time work really hard hours
uh significant time families friends less like
um obviously true people work hard across profession
definitely true neurosurgeons think good figuring
make time high quality um know even just texting friends um
neurosurgeons great friend mine just became chairman Duke
just connecting text takes seconds know feel feel
connected know think trait amongst neurosurgeons sort
know cut chase way um prioritize time skill
probably innately also part training know interns now
lot work hour regulations probably quite appropriate way um
think hours bordering uh uh not necessarily just say
not ideal mental health sleep know important
components um certainly no time meditation definitely not wish um
now knowing know meditation wife's health coach get see
practice um see value wish tool training
stressful um know even workout restrictions still don't sleep
much still work lot 80 hours know week throughout entire
career uh times training no work hour
restrictions sometimes feel like faculty get abused trainees little
bit protected now definitely reverse one point also huge
problem probably problem um joking little bit don't necessarily think
abused certainly hours significant um know come bit


know days operating long days
days lucky enough researcher know uh like

um answer question think sort self-selected
also think part training know long hours
hospital taking care sick patients sort type mentor approach
mentors hard us know learn cope stress
efficient prioritize things despite stress think know take
sort calm demeanor know perhaps um perhaps just amplifies

neurosurgeon learning residents faculty practicing specialty
know prior actually starting training never experience anything
like resident neurosurgery uh stress volume patients
take care long nights can quite Lonely way um
develop friends hospital sometimes call
backup can call chief resident attending really
learn take care patients obviously form teams nurses
staff things like residents can lonely can really
challenging think experiences neurosurgeons go
uh know tend sort unflappable personality perhaps started
bit compared average person training definitely amplifies
tools implement ever feel getting slightly off-center
now um know training actually remember second year
neurosurgery programs junior resident ways
toughest year not every way um toughest year young
inexperienced don't know don't know
tough year learn lot quickly patient safety
reasons self-survival know just learn lot um call
hospital uh real Challenge think know
know personally gained lot weight year exercise
consciously taking stairs refused take elevator uh Penn
HUB currently practice now remember see patients anywhere
sort ground floor Chama Bay ER way Founders


12th 12th floor never take elevator rule year
knew not time exercise just take stairs
beginning year little winded got 12th floor end
year actually didn't really phase became great Habit um
problem though paired unfortunately know lot sleepless
nights not enough sleep say terrible habit drinking coffee late
night put lot sugar sort way get
quick know um quick bout energy reason prioritized time
obviously knowing crash always always kind regretted
still anyway attribute poor decision making inexperience um
perhaps little vulnerable like think relate lot
research remember got married third year year
second year wife fiance time started going gym
together morning hours little better actually able
exercise operated day operated almost every day third year
resident remember get gym really early three months lost like 20
pounds wasn't trying lose weight just sleeping better taking care
remember got married know fit tuxedo

know one things look forward every night
know sometimes wife falls asleep come bed little later whisper
like okay turn app know


think value think helpful didn't

relate uh certain extent Spectrum um
case uh non-sequitur certainly think way use body's
physiology anticipate impulses coming online best
think just scratching surface kinds solutions need
problems epidemic proportions largest public health
problems country world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality mean
like third country maybe probably think
colleague Stanford Psychiatry told something still just blows mind
something like 75 percent antidepressant anti-anxiety medication
exists world consumed United States amazing mean
outrageous number yeah obsession country pharmacy
know pharmaceutical industry powerful probably related
aspect capitalism capitalistic just like everybody else um worry
little bit um know tend prescribe think
patients tend want medication like quick Solutions sometimes
medications provided sometimes not often just abandoned depends
problem course um agree need scalable Solutions know
neurosurgeon going able treat severe patients
problems know know done 200 000 deep brain
stimulation surgeries ever mean problem talking 50 million
Americans no possibility surgeons can address problem
help Inspire initiative go kind problem help make rigorous
last thing need know sort wearable fancy tool
know uh waste people's money time know need real therapies
things not devices discussing not uh think actually lots
promise use machine learning lab time not electrical
engineer computational neuroscientist type work just helped
develop hypotheses around um help fundraise around definitely
think future just

01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts

suspect scratching surface best talk hands
yeah sure neurosurgeons know know Faithfully protect hands


talking insurance expensive right guessing
not ones reach garbage disposal even eye
switch make sure isn't going get turned just precious
livelihood yeah um earlier talked deadlifts uh forms
exercise um things like tennis um drawing painting full range
things one can hands use imagination sure um true
neurosurgeons don't uh really like heavy grip activity can refine
motor motor circuits brain elsewhere can throw off neurosurgery
game say many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities put hands
risk um another one way know uh annual uh softball tournament
uh uh neurosurgeons come New York City Central Park softball
no just kidding well actually actually know typical hard softball don't
know call softball uh actually two close colleagues mine gotten
injured tournament maybe also must say poking fun
going medical profession also one uh
say well just going say steep hierarchy training
neurosurgery yes um certain harshness conveyed
training uh much like Astronaut training totally fair maybe tactic
uh weed either younger older generation says Evolution right uh
evolve need medical week guess well say one
individuals got injured one senior surgeons work now
one best athletes know definitely not weak can get
injured playing Sports uh said can tell briefly um think
know funny mother came recently osteopenia
told doctor told not allowed deadlifts like okay um
fine uh not telling deadlifts just don't exactly understand
relationship um can say think give little story reason
little hesitant confirm agree deadlifts um
operating Stanford University operating uh
mentioned earlier get interoperative CAT scan uh confirm accuracy
lectures surgeries reviewing CAT scan x-ray
technician looked said whispered ear like posture really bad
embarrassing physical posture surgeries yeah looked
kind wanted say won't curse yeah exactly intermittently


conversation made realize really bad posture
um kind little brief aside learned personal trainer
uh name Zach uh know said know posture
weak posture poor weak need strengthen
body strengthen core like like power lifting like
little hesitant tell started slowly can't prescribe power
lifting everybody exact reason said um gotten hurt
way think wish started little younger argue close
supervision well experienced trainer
argue neurosurgeon astronaut uh highly specialized
profession need limbs function dentists things like um
going take something like really needs extremely carefully
supervised can tell know trainer profound impact life
posture physical health uh deadlift admit
brought kind chuckled uh yes gotten mildly hurt
deadlifting kind cocky wasn't
paying attention technique actually
efficient way feel stronger improved posture uh
significantly miss since left California new trainer Philadelphia
great uh uh still deadlift occasionally uh can say
opposed deadlifting callously extremely well monitored
experienced um personal trainer weight lifter uh think great exercise
great love wrong case um huge proponent
podcast go mean much data now pointing fact
100 180 200 minutes Zone 2 cardio kind jogging cycling swimming type
behavior healthy everybody least yes
need well resistance training order know six hard sets per
muscle group per week really important just offset deterioration muscles
learning skeletal function tendon strength just maintain not
talking sets Absolute failure point um proper form
even

01:59:00 “Neurosurgeon Calm,” Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training



neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
closest friends um can relate probably um sort big

neurosurgeons think wonderful yes final question um
one think really maybe second final question earlier commented
remarkable calm least perceived calm neurosurgeons caused
effective training obvious one want trait
neurosurgeon um wouldn't want hyperactive certainly not impulsive neurosurgeon
given margins error tiny spatial scale probably
temporal scale yes don't want people things time
spontaneous think branch medicine selects
people least can know control kind fluctuations autonomic growl
can calm real time specific question never
operated human brain although privilege operating
room seeing experiments people VR remarkable
thing wish everybody get experience point not hopefully
patient unless need observe just striking
various uh stereotype behaviors surgeon surgeries graduate
student postdoc brains types animals find instance
started tremble little bit tapped left foot hand stabilize bit
kind need move body one feels impulse maybe
Tourette's like compulsions one can kind um siphon off
energy another limb remain precise sorts
things talking maybe entirely imagination
sorts things one learns neurosurgeon still body still Mind
meditative practice go operating room
particularly challenging morning poor night's sleep tools use
calibrate get Zone think interesting
people get insight even don't want neurosurgeon yeah
completely agree appreciate earlier uh reference neurosurgeons uh
astronauts also heard know us compared Cowboys
little bit less flattering uh know surgically really require
substantial amount confidence um confidence hopefully comes years
training experience um always worry confidence sort misplaced
problematic luckily rarely see training
rigorous know board uh American Board neurological surgeons
uh sort allows assesses surgeons continue practice holds us


really high bar think tends attract certain personality uh sub-specialty
like deep brain stimulation surgeon call stereotactic functional
neurosurgery know people likened us neurologists scalpel
um tend bit intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner
little bit friendlier um vascular neurosurgeon doesn't sleep
not friendly spine surgeons operate
know busy busy busy uh kind reputations going
around agree sort common feature calmness across
neurosurgeons know obviously favorite people
